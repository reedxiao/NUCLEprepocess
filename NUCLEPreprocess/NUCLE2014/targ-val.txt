Noes so important , for the nuclear popletely avoidable .
Most the investigators have come to a consensus that the primary cause for the Chernobyl is the failure of human management .
Because of the staff's breach of duty , the operators detected the reactors' problem very late and even took erroneous actions .
What's worse , the makeup of the working team was not adequate , for they didn't have timely backup system .
As a consequence , the emergency shut-down mechanism totally failed .
All these small human errors came together and finally led the Chernobyl explosion happen .
For the sake of avoiding the failure of human factors , some engineers and sociologists bring up the idea of applying psychological methods to engineering design process , which is really necessary and effective in my opinion .
However , some engineers hold the opinion that embed social psychology into the Engineering processes seems crazy and funny .
It is usually known thic at the efficient acoal , are limited because of limited sourcesectisuch a situation interface .
In their conservative view , they always care more about the how productive and reliable of thmanyhines are and neglect to focus on the role of huthe same in safeguarding .
But from the previous analysis of the Chernobyl nuclear accidents , we can see that correct human actions are indmorensable in preventing the disaster .
Indeed , the overall system's reliability and safety in a nuclear power plant is more often dependent on humans instead of the machines Why is that ?
Once the equipmentssurprisinginto use , the maximum reliability are already fixed .
Afterwards , we need well-trained and experienced operatorscountries the performance of the machines and always keep track of the status of the equipments .
In addition , in a hazard industrial plant , well-organized working team is also very necessary , which has orderly shifts system , immediate backup , and so on .
Without any of the above measures of human resource management , the reliability of the whole system will not be easy to be ensured .
Some conservatism may still oppose that " you insist human management is important .
Ok , I can hire good managers to improve the effectivenhighly hazardousn actions , still no need of applying psychology" .
On the contrary , focusing on improve the management in the engineering cesses is already a way of applying social psychology .
But it's not enough .
In the high hazard industry like nuclear power plant , everyone should be responsible and devotional instead of automatically workinpeoplethe management of tin ager or chief engineer .
Applying psychology in engineering design processes is to let everyone work efficiently , such as set-up couches for psychotherapeutic sessions for the operators and staff , can reduce the stress of the workers who work for long time under high pressure and help them relax .
All in all , human errors are avoidable , and psychology in engineering is meant to reduce the risk of occurrence of nuclear industry failure caused by human errors .
led to the Chernobyl explosiona timelyMost of thewereAnyway , all the efforts done by the investigator and engineers are to make the nuclepower plants much safer aitscan be more widely used to meet the great demand of energy today .
Applying psychology proviely improve nuclear industry's safety and reliability .
Maybe some engineers still oppose the use of psychology , it is worthwhile to include psychology in an engineering design process .
I'haddence that with the help of psychology , the usage of nuclear power will have a brighter future .

For many cases , safety is the most important aspect of a product , since it may be connected fortably enjoying the journey fortable and attractive .
In fact , over the years ICE expanded throughout Germany , the safety record ponent failures , but they lack the understanding of the breakdoing up with the plans against system breakdown .
In other words , they did not take the safety issues into account when they were designing the train .
However , some people argue , it is not fair to the engineers .
The train , ICE , did have adequate protection system as well as warning system .
Actually , the tragedy can be attributed to the flawed emergency operation procedures instead .
Passengers would have pulled the emergency break to stop the train as soon as they witness the wheel failure .
This is the key reason why the accident was so serious .
In face , one passenger sensed something are tightlyg , and tried to remind the driver of the hazard .
The driver , nevertheless , chose to ignore the report until it was too late .
One way and the best way to prevent the accideninmay be taking the appropriate safety precaution and applying correct methods to deal with the accident .

The ICE engineers just followed whatevercausingalready been designed , neglecting the current situation .
In addition , ICE was insufficiently tested before it was put into use .
However , it was not the case at all , according to others .
Technology at that time limited the desigconcernedE , thus caused the design failure .
If high technology had been used , and sufficient testing was performed , the accident would have been avoided . 
wasfactwitnesseda warningan adequateTo conclude , the use of psychology during the design process is important .
The key factors to prevent the train accident from happening are safety precaution , the proper actions taken during the accident and the use of high technology .
For decades , people have been searching for better energy sources .

In my point of videvelop
The Chernobyl disaster was one of the worst engineering accidents ever happened in history .
Not many people died that day but thousands of people were exposed to radiation that caused them to suffer severe health problems  .
Unfortunately , the cause of this incident was found to be unnecessary mistakes made by the nuclear plant operators .
People usually say that mistakes are inevitable and nuclear is in fact extremely dangerous so that working with it will always involve a high chance of accidents .
However , there are ways to reduce the possibility of this human-caused accident .
Including psychological factors consideration during the design process is found to be one of the ways to improve safety which might have prevented the Chernobyl incident .
Opponents claim that asishuman being , we make mistakes and it canthat has ever happenedd .
I agree to the point that human can make mistakes .
However , it does not mean that mistakes cannot be avoided .
This includes the mistakes made by the Chernobyl nuclear plant operators .
They did not request to maintain the power which caused it to run down rapidly until it was below the permitted safety level  .
This mistake wanuclear powerlly unnecessary since this was not their first time doing the safety test .
The problem lies on the behavior of the plant operators .
They took light of their task since for them this was just another safety test .
They any sense of responsibility and were not aware of the consequences if anything went wrong .
Therefore , during the design process , these plant operators are supposed to be 'designed' as well .
They should be given the required knowledge and should also be warned about the worst thing that may happen if they make even a simple mistake .
In this way , they will be more careful in doing their task and as a result able to avoid making mistakes .
Opponents also state that nuclear power is indeed dangerous for that reason , it is impossible not to have achumanst while working with it .
Accident is a situation when there is a failure in the interaction between man and machine  .
Therefore , even though nuclear power is certainly dangerous , it can still be safe to work with as long as the interaction between man and machine is designed carefully so that it will not fail .
Again , this shows the importance of considering psychological factors in design process .
Most of the times , whiin designing a system , engineers are likely to overestimate the ability of the user  .
As a result , most users are not able to properly use the equipments .
In the case of Chernobyl , the plant operators failed to make the right decision which then caused the reactor to explode .
Instead of following the safety procedure , the plant operators even blocked the reactor's protection system  in order to keep the test running  .
If the plant operators were familiar with the system and the procedure , they would have known which one was more will as a result be ableuld definitely have prioritized safety rather than keeping the test running .
Thus , in designing a system engineers alone are not enough .
making automatic shut down impossibleThe final argument proposewhile nuclear power is indeed dangerous for that reason ,humans who can make mistakes jaccidents engineers .
Hence , even An accidentir help mistakes are still inevitable .
The point of involving psychologists in the design process is not because they are better than engineers .
It is rather to balance the engineers' point of view which is usually machine-centered .
Since man and machines are equally important to achieve safety in design , psychologists' role is to concern about the human resources which are usually neglectetimeengineers .
If both machines and man are well designed , safety will definitely improve and the possibility of accidents will be reduced .
menbe concernedIn conclusion , carefully designing a system's safety is useless unless psychological factors are also considered .
Without considering psychological factors , there is a big possibility that there will be a bad interaction between man and machine which will then results in an accident such as Chernobyl's .
Therefore , psychological factors play an important role in reducing the possibilmen of accident as well as improving the system's safety .
the useThe plying promised the safety of the plant .
Thus , psychology could have indeed changed the reactor plant to a vastly safer environment .
On the other hand , otnts blame the heavy politico-military factors attached to the Chernobyl reactors .
In Chernobyl , the promised safety of the reactor .
Psychology or the employment of psychologists to assist the design process monplace .
Hence , designers could have could have brought in psychologists to evaluate the design to inhibit such unauthorized practices and to ensure the safety standards are kept high .
In short , the use of psychology could have been used to uphold the safety of theeven though theyactors and hence might have prevented the accident .
revealedIn contrast , other opponents may argue that the design process is beyond the domain of psychologists .
Instead , only the designer and the engineers have the expertise to partake in the design process .
Hopasses both social science and the engineering .

These factors are economic benefits , security , safety and effects on the environment .
Nuclear energy has been a hot topic since several decades age .
It is clear and poes safer .
Besides , in order to make the reaction safer , in Japan , the engineers have found out the methods to prevent the chemical reactions of sodium itself and the leak of sodium by using double-e a terrorist target because of the radioactive missioning cost are very high .
It is the fact that several billion dollars is needed to get a nuclear reactor going and the sodium-cooled fast reactors are even more expensive than other ones .
Hopacting the reactor vessel , sampling the vessel internals , reducing the loop number , shortening the pipes , integrating the primary components and so on .
Thus , we should believe in the bright future of the reducing of the sodium-cooled fast reactors' cost .
mind:the 1986 incident at Chernobyl in Ukraine , where the reactor core exploded ,meltdown occurred ,Nuclear popetitiveness , enhanced safety , minimal radioactive e radioactive and pared to SFR .
Safety is another major concern about nuclear popetitive in a changing market place of energy demand .
Nuclear energy has to be economically comparable to other energy sources in order for it to be a competitive energy source .
Nuclear energy plants need to be modular the temperatureness is necessary .
An the SFR system is reduction of cost to competitive levels .
None of the SFRs constructed to date have been economical to build or operate  .
With innovations to reduce capital cost , it can extend to eltricity production , given the proven capability of sodium reactors to utilize almost all of the energy in the natural uranium .

Psychological factors such as accountability , responsibility and professionalism play an important role in every design process .

Nuclear Energy The e . Supporters of other reactors believe that they have better performance .
Research has shown that the GFR system ranks the top for its sustainability  .
Like the VHTR system , GFR uses helium as coolant which has a high outlet temperature of 850 C , making it able to split hydrogen from water .
This is ideal for countries largely dependent on oil import because hydrogen is an important oil alternative used in fuel cells .
Reprocessing also enhances the performance as it could cut the final amount of waste up to 96%  .
The elements with long half-life are extracted and reused .
Only a small volume of waste is left behind .
Another debatable issue is the cost of building the GFR system .
Each of the six prototype costs about US$1 billion  .
However in long term , the cost is justified by the economics-of-scale .
It is also a research emphasis to achieve low system cost  .
For the gas- cooled reactors , this might be done by considering other coolants such as the S-CO2 , replacing the cladding materials and so on .
The es from oil and gas .
These fossil fuels are non-reneparison parison with other energy sources , the nuclear energy has the lowest fatality , as shown on the figure below: Source: Applied Energy 75  7986
It is shown that the fatality of Nuclear Power Plant  is 11 .9 per TeraWattHour energy produced , much lower than the other conventional energy sources .
requiredreactorshas beenthen , hence causingFinally , given that people are worried about thits radiation and its possibility to explode once it is under attackthat it will be safer and more efficient for us .
It is a fact that there are thousands of nuclear reactors in operation in the world now .
Hence , we should research a new generation of reactor even more to replace the old ones .
In conclusion , the nuclear power is the solution for the current energy crisis .
By researching thration of nuclear reactor , we can enjoy more efficient and safer energy around us .
Further research and development funding for Generation IV nuclear reactors , particularly the Very- High-Temperature Reactor  , should be supported .
the Veryare ,has beenincreasing , andEver since Mankind has started using fossil fuels for energy , 400 billion tonnes of carbon has been released and eventually e its disadvantages .
Thus , further research and development funding for VHTR shohas become supported .Thesis
According to the latest energy consumption statistics in 2008 , the majority of energy consumption e the top priority issue .
For the present , nuclear energy is gradually playing increasingly vital role in the energy supply due to its high efficiency and abundant raing out , especially the VHTR , I firmly believe all the difficulties prises of research , development , regulation , construction costs , and the contribution to the nuclear paring its cost pared to the past .

The Tenerife runpetent in creating aircrafts .
However , the designers failed to understand that aircrafts were to be piloted by humans , and not some fearless beings .
When the aircraft personnel suddenly found themselves in a panic situation , they could not respond appropriately because the aircraft was never built to be putbeen takentricky situations .
However , some people say that the accident was caused due to human error .
Upon realising that there was a crisis , the aircraft crew of each vessel responded without much consideration as to what their actions might lead to .
People then blamed the cause of the accident on the aircraft crew of both sides for badly managing the situation .
Still , the reason behind the cause of the accident cannot be blamederrorshe aircraft crew .
The aircraft crew reacted the way they reacted because the plane was not built with all the necessary functions for them to react in an unexpected situation .
For example , under low-visibility conditions , there was no way the Pam Am officer could differentiate between a stationary and a vibrating aircraft nearby .
Had strong light-emitting devices been installed on the KLM aircraft , an unambiguous signal would have been sent , leaving the Pan Am officer with a clear signal .
In this situation people cannot say that the Pan Am officer did not do his job because he a kept lookout on the surroundings , but in the midst of the fog , the presence of the KLM aircraft signaled an ambiguous message .
Also , had proximity sensors been installed within the Pan Am aircraft , the whole accident could have been prevented .
The Pan Am officer saw the KLM through the fog and noticed its apparent static state when it was in fact still moving .
If an alarm was sounded upon when safety distance between the Pan Am and KLM aircraft was breached , the Pan Am crew would have steered their aircraft away from hazard .
The undetected KLM aircraft collided with the Pan Am aircraft because by the time the Pan Am officer realised that the KLM was nearing their aircraft , it was too late .
Had he been warned by the ringing alarm of a proximity sensor , he would have gotten nough time to respond and not panic when the impending collision was apparent .
not to panicTherefore , psychology has been recognized as an integral part of the design process today .
Students enrolled in the engineering courses in Ngee Ann Polytechnic nowadays are required to study interdisciplinary subjects , one of which includes introductory psycho .
For these reasons , we conclude that the accident in the Tenerife runway could have been avoided , had the use of psychology been applied in the designing .
If designers still persist that psychological considerations are of hardly any importance , then the users of their products may well be put in situations where accidents are bound to occur .
At the beginning of 2002 , 438 nuclear poe potential safety hazard .
Therefore , the second advantage which stands out the VHTR is because that VHTR doesn't produce any nuclear waste .
VHTR could even generate hydrogen at the same time under its high temperature .
We may cut the cost spending using in nuclear waste when we use VHTR .
Hydrogen generated values because of its high thermal value and can also be used without any pollution .
VHTR uses Helium as its coolant instead today's water-cooled reactor and transfers energy into hydrogen surely save the source .
In summary , VHTR is the best in using nuclear power which surely will bring us a new energy stream .
Just like Abraham said , "we will have energy that is safe , abundant , reliable , inexpensive and proliferation resistant ."

After the catastrophe that happened at Chernobyl , Russia 1986 , the World start to be concerned more carefully about the safety and security of nuclear poe to an end soon .

Therefore , nuclear poparing to coalworld'sd and natural gas fire , though nucr plant initially is expensive to build butcautioness expensive to run and has more proven longer-term benefits .
There have been numerous improvements in construction methods in thtime fee upisra lot ofo 55 per cent for the current generation .
At the same time , SFR concept is significantly good at making full use of uranium effectively .
Beside , SFR has advantage in disposal requirement , in mit renee the reality; more than six billions people have to deal with the shortage of food supply . . . As to all energy generation technology , there are advantage and disadvantages with nuclear power .
The world therefore cannot afford to ignore the potential source of low carbon energy provided by these fast nuclear reactors .

If the engineers and designers can predict that humans can be careless at work sometimes , they will design a cutter that can detect human's hand when placed inside and stop the operation immediately .
Hence engineers can produce better design with more safety if they predict human's behavweighed
Even though predicting human 'error' can help in design processes , but that cannot prevent accidents .
Engineers and designers cannot predict behavior s of every human .
During the prediction , engineers may predict human actions wrongly .
80% and more accidents are caused by human 'error' rather than fully machines or systems .
In the Sayano-Shushenskaya's hydroelectric power plant accident , the evidence or that leads to the accident was human 'error' .
The system showed many warning signs about the failure in it .
The bolts that hold the turbines were 90% teared out .
Since the bolts were fatigued , the system was producing noise .
Although the system showed signs of damage , humans were negligent about the damage .
There had been three other major accidents excluding this accident since the construction of the plant .
The previous accidents in 1979 , 1985 and 1988 were caused by spring floods that overwhelmed the dam's capacity .
This shows that the design of the power plant was not stable for generating energy .
Therefore , during the psychological process of thinking , mistakes can occur which results in poor design and lead to accidents .
designedTo close up the arguments , accidents are mistakes with bad consequences .
The Sayano-Shushenskaya's hydroelectric power plant accident would be avoided if the humans had not negligent the warning given by the system .
But psychology can only play a part in design processes to create a better design but not prevent accidents from occurring .
Humans can never work without making error .
With psychology , engineers and designers can design only to reduce human 'error' but cannot prevent human 'error' .
Therefore , accidents cannot be prevented but can be reduced by psychology in the design processes .
Some bad memories mon explanation for this painful accident is that O-ring joint problem leads to the leakage of fuel and eventually results in the explosion of space shuttle .
Homitments to their tasks and make decisions out of consideration , the chance of accident prevention might be largely enhanced .
To begin mittee made an inaccessible schedules and 'modify the technical and procedural standard' for the engineers  .
Without sufficient time given , hoponent parts of the space shuttle to be produced ?
Even though some of them ponent parts could minimize 'erroneous actions' by applying psychology in their design  .
For instance , because of the limited time , the engineers ply pleting one's omittee of the Challenger space shuttle actually got a e of the entire program , if they really have had the sense of responsibility ings , the accounts of the Challenger disaster are largely due to the ignorance and irresponsibility of both the engineers and programme managers .

due tothe There have been  many engineering accidents  in the past and nomunication among team members .
Homon problem encountered in evehave showndesign product including engineering product is the different perspective betmon opinions instead of assumptions .
In fact , psychology had been used in the past for improving human behaviours by selecting , training and motivating the operators in industries .
However , this might have been avoided due to time constraints and financial limit which result in insufficient time for design engineers to analyse the design and looking for other cheaper materials for substitution .
As a result , one small mistake of a worker could lead to a huge damage to the plant and also to the surrounding environment especially for nuclear plant .
Therefore , nowadays there is an encouragement to have human scientists  in the design team  .
Psychologist is not only a scientist seeking knowledge for others to use , but also a technologist who is actively involving in the planning and design man-operated system  .
In other words , system design is an applied psychology because of its human reference; by converting design engineers to psychologists or at least having psychology knowledge may help in design process as they would take into account of human behavior .
A correct design at the beginning stage is very important to prevent accident .
Most of the accidents occurred because of human errors either done by operators or even designer at the dThe designerage .
As design enginethe userand operators are human beings , psychology could have been integrated in the design process to analyse possible errors from the design and human behaviours .
Moreover , with psychology knowledge , a design engineer would be capable of predicting the situation under worse condition .
Hence , system would be incorporated with proper safety features to prevent accident .
are With the introduction of the Generation IV reactors in 2001 , a fresh mon topics like safety , security and cost and performance are once again discussed .
The goals of Generation IV reactors are set toparative to the other .
The reasons being that VHTR addresses the pared to Sodium-Cooled reactor , since Sodium is explosive in contact pared to other reactors .
the growingHopared to other reactors .
Hence , it does not contribute to the pared to the norm of about a millennium .
VHTR is thus a better reactor .
Apart from safety and environmental issues , Nuclear Energy should be encouraged due to its loplacent and continue to improve and foresee future problems that the VHTR A nuclear elop in the future , so that Nuclear Energy continues to be viable and safe .
Presently , they should look into the problem of cooling agents , as well as other alternatives for Uranium .
These reactors are likely to be relied on as a possible source of energy for at least the next two to three decades  .
Other than such technical problems we should also look into the possible human misuse in Nuclear Energy and take caution not to let any disaster happen .

with regardTmonly heard would be 'if only' .
However , no one can guarantee that the incident would not have happened even if more precautions had been undertaken .
Instead of thinking whether accidents of the past could have been prevented , why not think of how to greatly reduce the chance of future accidents happening ?
The use of psychology might be one direction to go towards .
However , no matter how safe the end product of an engineering design may be , unforeseen circumstances will still occur .
Hence , I believe that the use of psychology during the design process would not have prevented the accident .
In conclusion , I do not deny the fact that the use of psychology to improve engineering ethics and refine the thought process involved in the design stage helps in reducing the occurrence of accidents .
However , there are still many factors that cannot be eliminated through the use of psychology .
Therefore , I believe that the use of psychology during the design process would not have prevented the collapse of the Mississippi River Bridge on 1st August 2007 .

breakthroughthat occuredWe are on the brink of time e from oand coal  .
These conventional poplications such as nuclear race and terrorism .
It is because reprocessing can produce plutonium pared to diesel pare to other technologies .
Combined e a choice of technology for engineers and governments to focus their attention to develop .
In addition , hydrogen power output of VHTR is an additional incentive that VHTR is worth researching .
In conclusion , VHTR has very promising path to be the generator of the future and we should channel our efforts to further develop and research the technology to be able to use broadly .
nuclear energysourcesBy 2030 , the es out bined mercially deployed by 2030 .
As quoted by Patrick Moore , Greenpeace co-founder , "It is a big mistake if e more aing terrorist target .
The incidents of core melt-dopared to conventional plants .
Hobined and made the VHTR number one choice , outbidding the SCWR .
In term of cost , Generation IV reactors are designed to be economically viable .
The generating cost should not be too high but competitive as compared pared to SCWR .
This is because the design of the cycle for SCWR is pretty simplistic as it does not require the use of jet pumps , pressurizes or dryers .
One of the greatest aspects about SCWR is the implausible small size of reactor itself , as compared as other reactors of Generation IV .
Nevertheless , some countries such as the United State and France prefers the VHTR rather the SCWR .
In spite of the fact that cost of building for VHTR is relatively higher , two products are generated for the price of one .
Besides , the VHTR deployment is earlier than most of the Generation IV reactors , which is aimed to be on the year of 2020 .
The United State energy bill would provide a sum of USD 1 .1 billion to build a research prototype at Idaho lab .
exposingwhen opponents , VHTR is the best choice among the six Generation IV reactors .
In term of security , it produces no waste , especially plutonium , as waste goes directly into repository .
In term of cost , VHTR able to generate electricity and hydrogen for the price of one , which is estimated to be roughly $1 billion .
In term of performance , VHTR generates electricity at efficiency as high as 50% .
VHTR is likely to be the most advanced concept in terms of practical experience as Japan already operating a similar high temperature reactor at Oarai .
Nonetheless , VHTR faces material constrain as the materials use to design reactor must be able to withstand continued high temperature , intense bombardment in nuclear proliferation and corrosive reagents .
Therefore , it is ideal that GIF should start siphoning funds to conduct intensive researches on nuclear power plants .
Nuclear energy has albined mendable qualities , the MSR is a better investment as a generation IV reactor .
First and foremost , the cost of building a VHTR is much cheaper than that of a MSR , it being 30% cheaper to build as compared to the MSR .
Though the costs incurred are higher for the MSR , it compensates by raising its efficiency .
At 1000 C , the MSR projects a yield of 60% e across as time consuming and uneconomical , technological advances in that area can further reduce cost by making it fully automated .
Secondly , the VHTR has high efficiency in converting heat to electricity .
As a result , the VHTR need not use liquid to gas exchangers , unlike the MSR .
Hobat intruders .
The pared to the conventional U-235 used today .
As a result , the usage of U-233 has also posed concerns to both staff pared to the VHTR .
Technological advances can make the MSR automated in certain sectors and prevent health issues to people working in the vicinity .
Using nuclear popared to the other conventional ones .
It is cheaper because of the reactor's efficiency and simpler design pared to the energy being needed to run the pared to the harnessing of other forms of energy .
The cost of the building does not include the cost of fuel , building materials and the cost of land needed to build ththeseactors .
With the increased in outside temperature , the performance of the nuclear reactors will drop as it is dependent on the temperature of the nuclear cores .
In conclusion , the supercritical-water-cooled reactors should not receive further research and development funding for it , the rise of terrorism and the making of nuclear bombs from nuclear waste make nuclear reactors a controversial issue .
was razedCries of terror and bloodcurdling screams filled the night air as the familiar dome shaped structure in the distance began to glopromising the safety aspects .
Firstly , pared to the other designs pared to hydrogen .
Therefore , this reactor has multiple benefits apart from mere electricity output and may be a better choice to contemplate .
The next fact that VHTR outshines the other reactors in is safety .
Safety is highly regarded as one of the most important reasons in the decision of the final nuclear reactor concept .
In all aspects of nuclear technology , safety should be monitored regularly and stringent safety standards adhered to by all the generation IV nuclear plants .
Hopletely mechanical and the chances of a failure due to human arbitration drop to a minimal .
This demonstrates the superiority of the VHTR as compared to the other generation IV concepts .
In conclusion , the VHTR pared to the other reactors .
As all the reactors require capacious sums of funds to construct any of the generation VI nuclear plants pared to the other concepts .
The VHTR is a better choice due to its capability to generate hydrogen gas which can be used as fuel and due to its excellent fail-safe concept which may prevent an adversity should it arise .
More resources should be allocated to further research and develop Generation Four  nuclear poparison to the 5000 deaths annually due to coal mining activities  .
In fact , the Three Mile Island incident parable to those at gas-fired plants , as nuclear plants buy their uranium fuel at an agreed price three years in advance  .
In addition , better technology ing more efficient  .
Very-high-temperature reactor  , one of the concepts of GIV reactor , will be operating at around 1000 C instead of the 330 C in current model of reactors .
With higher operating temperature , efficiency of the plant will be increased .
Comparing to the conventional nuclear plant today , VHTR is expected to produce 50% more electricity  .
Besides safe and economic , nuclear power is also environmental friendly as it does not produce any greenhouse gases such as Carbon Dioxide in the case of fossil fuel burning plants .
The spent fuel rod used in nuclear power plant can be reprocessed and reused , this reduces the amount of nuclear waste that need to be stored permanently .
In summary , nuclear power is reliable , green and affordable .
Previous accident such as the Chernobyl is highly unlikely to reoccur given the current high standard of safety .
With the forecast that we will need 40% more electricity by 2030  , accepting the practical advantages of nuclear power is both environmentally and economically sensible .
Hence , we should support further research and development of GIV reactors .
* Performance
is Molten salt reactors adopt molten salt mixture as a primary coolant , instead of traditional molten sodium coolant .
This modification allopared to traditional solid-fuel reactors  .
There is no high pressure steam in the core and the molten salt is of lopared to the traditional uranium-238 and plutonium cycle .
* Cost
Thorium is three times more abundant in nature compared to uranium and occurs mainly as 'fertile' .
It is mercially reduce the cost in terms of fuel source .
Thanks to its different operation that involves molten salt , a MSR eliminates the fuel enrichment and fuel fabrication , both of e commercially available .
In conclusion , it is quite reasonable for us to consider doing more research on and commercialise the molten salt reactor concept , as well as other types of generation IV reactors .
In retrospect to our history , when some new techniques were developed , they all had the priority .
It was and also is consensus that new technology means our future development .
As a cutting-edge technology , nuclear power should get more support and be on the way to prosperity .
The fossil fuels on the Earth are towards exhaustion soon , we have to take precautions before it is too late .
On April 12 , 1981 , the 20th anniversary of the first human spaceflight , Columbia - the first space shuttle in the municate with the management officials and teach them to think in a more critical way , the results would not be catastrophic .
Sometimes it is impossible to prevent problem occurring , but we can still solve the problem .
Once again , NASA disappointed us .
After the launch , engineers asked NASA management to visualize the damage many times , but NASA never responded and did not give any resolution since they did not believe the damage would be so severe .
This kind of psychological problem as being irresponsible is really unforgivable .
Even one board member Feynman questioned why the management was so confident in the machinery  .
With the help of psychology , we can thoroughly improve the management system effects by solving official's psychological problems .
After all , to be more precise and realistic is the basic need to make problem solving decisions .
The Spacedy had already happened , and we cannot change past .
However , we must learn something to prevent such things occurring again .
Psycto uslogy has the function to guide people to understand technological imperfections and give effective problem solving decision .
At least in the Columbia issue , I am very sure the use of psychology would have prevented the accident .

From statistics , 20% to 50% of incidents , including failures , accidents and near-accidents , plex and high-hazard nature .
The second reason is simply because some design errors e up mon for engineers and planners to commit mistakes and neglect what they think are not important .
Thus , by employing psychology , whether it is hiring a psychologist or just the employment of psychological approaches , problems that used to be unpredictable can be foreseen .
Improvements and enhancements can then be implemented pertaining to these problems and , as a result , lower the chances of accidents happening .

Instead of shunning away , we should learn to be receptive and reach for greater height in both the medical field as well as the robotics field .
"If you are looking at the future , it's hard to envision a hospital not offering robotics ," said Robert Glenning , chief financial officer at the Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey . 
incomplete sentenceuseExperts have predicted that pared to coal reactors and even some of the other Generation IV reactor concepts .
In short , the high temperatures e a threat to the public as safety measures are taken to prevent accidents; instead , the high temperatures can be used to improve the efficiency of VHTR .
Public concerns over safety and nuclear proliferation have retarded the gromonly termed as passive safety design .
The VHTR uses helium as a coolant for the reaction and helium is extremely inert toposed of prismatic graphite , and has high heat capacity and structural stablility at high temperature and pressure .
This petitive as compared plements the situation .
Thirdly , oppositions of nuclear energy have also questioned the performance of nuclear technology .TS According to Butler  , the VHTR is able to squeeze out 50% more energy from the same amount of fuel comapred pared to conventional popetitive in the near future .
Furthermore , non-proliferation of plutonium through VHTR process reduces the production of WMD .
However , the threat of nuclear accidents still persist and it is up to our own engineers to further resolve this threat .
Thus , funds should be provided in this case to strengthen the passive safety design in VHTR reactors .
First of all , safety is always the primary concern when introducing a newly developed technology .
The researchers who are in favour of VHTR argue that the resource of VHTR , helium - an inertia gas with low chemical activity is much safer than sodium , the coolant of SFR .
If the sodium leaks from the core then there could be a tremendous explosion .
This could be a serious threat to safety .
Although it is true that sodium is relatively active , there is an extra loop in the SFR producing process in order to prevent the accident  .
Moreover , there are several cycles in the process of SFR and each individual is segregated .
Therefore it is hardly that the reactor will leak out .
Besides the chemical behavior , the operating condition is another element responsible for the safety .
According to Carlsson , Tucek and Wider's conclusion  , the probability of incurring the accident of losing coolant is proportional to the operating temperature and pressure .
VHTR requires quite high operating temperature at 1000 Celsius and pressure .
On the contrary , SFR is best performed under low pressure and only 350 to 500 Celsius degree  .
Hence the operating conditions make the SFR practically safe as a result of the low possibility of incurring the losing coolant accident .
Lastly , there is no separate plutonium generated in all processes of SFR , which is a highly radioactive and toxic element .
As a result , the proliferation can be controlled .
Apart from the safety of nuclear power , the high efficiency is another factor that prompts the researchers to promote SFR method .
The Department of Nuclear Energy of University of California , Berkeley  , announced that the thermal efficiency of SFR could be upgraded to 47 percent resulting from the reheat and inter-cooling process design , which is a breakthrough in terms of the efficiency of energy conversion .
Unlike the VHTR , the SFR utilizes metallic fuel with neutron spectrum , which is capable of transmuting the raw materials to green energy efficiently .
Not only is the efficiency the breakthrough , but also the recycle of resource is very remarkable .
The recycle model of SFR is unique and the best among the six methods in the fourth generation .
As part of the waste of SFR can be re-utilized again as the resource of the reactor , the whole process acts like a self-supply system .
This quality can solve the resource shortage problem of the majority of energy supply methods .
Also , the recycle concept best explains the green technology .
The columnist Butlehas  from Washington Times brings up the idea that the U .S . should give the green light for nuclear energy .
To support the idea , Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor is the ideal method representing the essence of nuclear energy , secured safety and high efficiency .
It is better to embrace the dawn of the Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor instead of fearing the future it brings .

Chernobyl nuclear accident is one of the most terrible disasters in the history of engineering development .
This accident happened on April 26 , 1986 , ing gases .
Without either a system to filter exhaust neither gases nor a containment structure  , the release of radioactivity could quickly spread in all directions and causes more serious results .
As analyzed , by removing the errors above , the accident can be prevented .
Hence psychology should be functional for preventing the accident .
Hoe from testing or even accidents .
The opposite side actually argues plicated structure and what they should do is no more than investing some more money to build it .
For the facts mentioned above , we can conclude that the accident actually could be prevented if the designers gain good enough psychology that concern meconcernedlwith safety

How we wish that the designers of the Chernobyl reactor RBMK had gain good psychology , so that they would not use the unstable core , the ineffective control rods and the inflammable moderator , and would kindly design an enclosed containment for exhaust gases .

Within 30 years , nuclear energy has transformed from an exotic , futuristic idea into a ing more appealing compared panied the development of nuclear energy since its birth .
The reasons for this centre round the issues of safe operation , radioactive pared bined with the fact that the average radiation we human received from peaceful nuclear fuel cycle is only 0 .1 percent of the inevitable exposure to(Lehr , J . , 2009) resources and building materials  , nuclear energy will definitely provide mankind with tremendous benefits that can never be achieved by other types of power .
One more major drawback of the peaceful use of nuclear energy is that it has allowed the production of nuclear weapons .
As Einstein has said before , "I don't know what weapon will people fight with in world war three , but I know that they will use stones and sticks in world war four" .
The destructive power of nuclear weapon has long been a threat to the entire human being .
As concerning the 911 disaster , terrorists may possibly target nuclear facilities or use radioactive materials for massive destruction .
From my perspective , in cases like these , it is not the double-edged nuclear technology to blame , but the hands that touch it .
This is an unavoidable dilemma for the advance of science and everyone has to accept the unforeseeable risks when they are enjoying the benefits .
Overall , nuclear energy holds bright prospect as a front edge technology that would allow us to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels , occupying less land yet generating more power .
However , in order for the industry to reach its full potential , we must find ways to address the problem of safe operation , waste disposal and security issues as well .
There is a rising demand for energy today .
With the concerns of global e from the use of conventional energy source , pare to conventional method .
Hopletely clean .
According to Butler  , nuclear energy gives zero green house gases , and parable pare to generation III reactors .
Also , wind and solar power are intermittent and unpredictable .
They are unable to replace big base-load nuclear plants such as coal like generation IV nuclear reactors do .
Therefore , nuclear energy is the only viable substitutes .
In conclusion , we should increase funding for research and development for generation IV nuclear reactors .
Nuclear energy is the best substitution for coal and natural gas .
Current emissions of carbon dioxide from automobiles and industries are furiously contributing to global warming .
Nuclear energy would be able to clean the air and reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
Furthermore , I believe that the generation IV nuclear reactors will be very safe as our technology is improving daily .

Peter Rullhusen , Nuclear Data Needs for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems , the international workshop .
With the development of the post-modern society , more and more energy is required for its maintenance and groe out .
Hopared to the high cost , the benefit from developing Generation IV reactors is insufficient .
Generally , the Generation IV reactors are knopare the reduction of greenhouse effect e up with strategy to deal with this problem , we cannot afford to set up the R&D funding for the development of generation IV reactors .
The technology so far is not able to prevent corrosion of nuclear metallic materials .
However , Generation IV reactors still need some container to hold the radioactive materials .
The main materials used in nuclear reactors are Ni alloys , stainless steels , Zr alloys , low alloyed steels , copper alloys and Ti .
Apart from Ti , each one of the main metallic materials listed above experiences at least one of the following types of corrosion: Stress Corrosion Cracking  , Irradiation-assisted Stress Corrosion Cracking  , Environmentally Assisted Cracking  , Intergranular Attack  , Flow-assisted Corrosion  , General Corrosion  , Ammonia Corrosion  and Microbiologically Influenced Corrosion   .
However , Ti is too expensive and thus makes it of high cost to build generation IV reactors .
In this case , there should not be R&D funding for the development of generation IV reactors .
Building generation IV reactors will cost much but only reduce a small amount of world's greenhouse effect .
Building generation IV reactors will leave us in nuclear-weapon-danger and terrorism-danger .
What is worse , the technology cannot prevent corrosion of nuclear metallic materials .
In conclusion , there should not be R&D funding for the development of generation IV reactors .
As the search for a nees into focus as one of the most reliable and efficient replacement alternative fuel .
Nuclear reactors are already generating 17% of the pounds to make bines the latest safety features into its design .
VHTR uses helium gas as its main coolant .
Helium is an inert gas and thus it does not react and become radioactive pounds .
The core of VHTR is made of graphite , pound can further minimize terrorist threats and increase public safety .
The cost of building nuclear reactors are expensive and the public argues that too much money pared to other form of alternative energy , VHTR is build to last 60 years  and thus in the long run the overall cost in building is fully compensated by its length of service .
Over its 60 years of service , VHTR bined cycle design for electricity generation , enabling a common heat source to be used for electricity and hydrogen generation .
This neplexity and minimizes risks of system failure  .
a by-productNuclear energy is the ultimate solution as a clean and renewable energy source to curb the escalating greenhouse effect and depletion of fossil fuels .
By and large , VHTR , as the new generation of nuclear reactor , with its high performance , enhanced safety design and cost effectiveness , promises to be the most reliable way to generate clean energy in the future .
For the past fepared to renepose and also contaminathas faced land rendering it useless for other purposes .
This cost of reprocessing nuclear pared to previous versions .
The ITER utilizes a nemissioned in Europe .
is beingNuclear popared against other forms like coal and diesel popared against traditional coal poe , would be since maize meant for biofuel could fetch a higher price more farmers will choose to sell their maize crop to producers of biofuel and not to market .
This could spike an increase in food prices driving more people towards poverty .
have In conclusion , nuclear power should be pursued based on improved designs of nuclear reactors such as the ITER and for its environmental friendliness and to reduce global warming .
Throughout the long-standing history of humanity , the energy has played a crucial role in changing the civilization to the nepared to other rivals , for example , e from endeavor to overcome currents difficulties: heat- resistant fuels and materials , high fuel burn-ups , and temperature control .
supportin factFirst , researches has shoposite has been selected to make control rod cladding petitive to the othe .Furthermore , safety design also eliminate the chance of leaking radiation , make nuclear reactor a absolutely clean energy .
It should be evident that all public opposition can be solved entirely by new technology and concept .
As a result , we can affirm that the concesearching fory High Temperature Reactor should be a first priority in further researches and funding to quickly turn it into reality in near future .
Nuclear energy is an alternative source of energy ing reactors , knoparable to the generation of electricity using coal as a fuel .
In terms of fuel costs , both the costs are almost equal , as the transportation of coal nullifies the cost of the uranium used in nuclear reactors in generating the same amount of electricity .
The capital costs are more in nuclear reactors due to the safety issue involved in construction , pared to the construction of coal plants .
The maintenance and operation costs are higher in nuclear power plants due to labour , replacement of plant parts , license fees and local property taxes .
The waste related cost for coal is mainly due to ash , whereas in nuclear plants it is from the radioactive waste generated .
In conclusion , the generation IV reactors are more advantageous over the current reactors being used because of the benefits which include , the nuclear waste that lasts for a lesser time , increase in efficiency as more energy is generated from the same amount of fuel and the ability to reuse the spent fuel in generating electricity .
These Generation IV reactors look into four main advancements , namely enhanced safety , proliferation resistance , waste minimization and economic viability .
Safety issues , cost and security requirements along with the eventual depletion of the fossil fuels , thrones Nuclear Energy as the main source of power for the future .
Having being questioned and opposed for a long period , the nuclear popared pletely solved yet .
For instance , opponents criticize that some materials are not easy to find and some e more mature and we can gain a kind of promising energy for the long run .
Energy is an important driving force for the world .
Traditional energy can no longerise tine this mission .
It can not support sustainable development .
It is high time we attached enough significance to the promising nuclear energy like SWCR by funding its research and development to make it more palatable .

In 1950s and 1960s , the testing nuclear poposition of fluoride salts at high temperatures is a great threaten to the environment .
Fluorine or HCFCs are can pollute the air and cause damage to the ozone layer .
Moreover , it does not require clean and fresh water to be the coolant , so sea water or some used water can be recycled as coolant of the nuclear reactor .
Because of the above , water is the most suitable material to be the coolant of the generation IV reactors , so supercritical- water-cooled reactor is largely superior to the other five kinds in terms of coolant .
be producedWith present science and technology level , the nuclear power can be used by human beings for approximately 20 years .
The estimated year to deliver supercritical-water-cooled reactor is 2025 , and it is within the period that the nuclear energy on the earth can last .
In general , supercritical-water-cooled reactors exceed other five kinds of generation IV nuclear reactors on coolant to a large degree and could be developed in about 5 to 10 years which is relatively short and acceptable .
Hence , supercritical-water-cooled reactor can be considered a better kind among all generation IV nuclear reactors .
Current nuclear generation has been applied into different areas to generate secure and inexpensive electric energy .

There are certain disorders that exist  that  have adverse effects on the health of individuals .
Genetic testing is then carried out to determine if a person carries genes for certain inherited disorders .
Of course , if the disorder is treatable , one would not worry so much about the consequences .
However , if the disorder turns out to be non-treatable , the ethical issue as to whether the carrier of the known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives arises .
The issues of privacy and discriminationsupport the position that the carrier should not be obliged to disclose the information to his relatives .
Secondly , discrimination from  relatives affects the carrier's decision in revealing his condition .
One might never know how one's relatives would react upon knowing the condition of the carrier .
The reactions can be extreme , either keeping a distance away from him or sharing the pain together with the carrier .
For example , some relatives would have the thinking that the genetic risk of the carrier would bring about a bad reputation to them so they may start to distance themselves and try to eliminate all contact with him .
Discrimination has been found to have harmful effects on people such as putting them at a high risk of depression .
It is already bad for a carrier to have a genetic risk; it would be much worse if depression strikes him .
Thus , a carrier should not be obligated to tell his relatives about his genetic risk .
In conclusion , it is the social and emotional aspects that affect the carrier's decision on whether or not he should make known his genetic risk to his family members .
Timing is also an important factor  .
Thus , a carrier should not be obligated to tell his relatives about his genetic risk .

the soleholdsrevealshadIn recent years , there has been an increasing trend of individuals coming fore .
declaredoesFirstly , an individual pany pany finds it a loss to make a healready or potentially-sick' individual .
Furthermore , employers panies and employers  .
Genetic discrimination will not take place if the individual had the final say in revealing the result of such testing , as the individual had withheld the information and life would go on as per normal until the disease presents its signs and symptoms .
When the individual iscovered for having a genetic disorder and not declaring the status beforehand , the individual will bear all the consequences , which includes genetic discrimination since the individual had the choice to weigh on the pros and cons of the matter before the individual made a decision on keeping the condition to himself .
Therefore , the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the result of such testing .
Secondly , if the individual requesting genetic testing does not have the final say in whether to reveal the result of such testing , the individual will have problems with his loved ones , such as stress within the family and strained family relationships  .
the family of the individual finds out through the family physician instead of the individual's self , the family will beet since the individual chose to hide the information .
Even if the individual chooses to tell the family at a later timing for the benefit of not wanting to worry his loved ones , thupsetily will on the other hand feel that it was irresponsible of the individual not to share his/her burden with the family , since the family had to find out the truth from another party .
This could be prevented if the individual concerned broke the news to his family members so that they can discuss as a family .
As such , it is up to the individual's discretion in revealing the genetic test results .
In conclusion , the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing not only to avoid genetic discrimination in society but also to promote family relations .
.In recent years , genetic testing has emerged as a nepared to its latter stage .
latives of tisidual can also plan for their own future , with the knowledge that wuture  .lans that they might have , they have to put into account of the genetic disorder .
For example , if a couple wants to have a baby , and either the father or the mother is a carrier of certain genetic problems , they would consider the probabilities of the unborn child being born with the same deficiency .
Thus it is absolutely vital morally for the affected individual to inform his relatives of his genetic disorder , so as to prepare his relatives psychologically , medically and financially .
Thus the carrier is not only being responsible to himself , but also to his relatives and even future generations .
However , critics might want to argue that his relatives will alienate him , and thus making the individual feel isolated and uncared for .
I believe that despite risking alienation , the moral responsibility in telling his relatives of the problem is more important than the former as it will give his relatives adequate warning about the potential risk that might affect them too .
means .In conclusion , I believe that the individual is not obligated to inform his or her relatives about his genetic problems , either legally or be it personal rights .
However , he still must have the moral responsibility to inform his relatives about his genetic disorders so as to prepare the latter psychologically , medically and financially .
Firstly , a known genetic risk carrier is obligated to tell his or her relatives  because of their right to know .
They should know that they are vulnerable to the risk of family disease which can be inherited .
This allows them to have mental preparation about what will possibly happen and to react to the risk .
In addition , knowing of their genetic risk will help them in making some important decisions and plans such as whether to have children or not .
The right of relatives or families to know the genetic test results can be seen in a WHO report on medical genetic issues  , which address family members have that familyl obligation to share genetic information with each another , and thus they can choose whether to be tested themselves .
deathsSecondly , a known genetic risk carrier is obligated to tell his or her relatives  to save their lives .
If the relatives know  the  possible risk in genetic disease , they can request forthe genetic test for themselves .
In case the test results are positive , they will be able to receive medical treatment to reduce risk .
In some circumstances , it is possible to cure a genetic disease in early stage .
This allows the relatives of a genetic disease patient , or even the patient himself , to recover fully from the disease .
For instance , according to the US national institute of health  ,caught early , the chances for surdiscoveredare the greatest and this prevent thousands of cancer deathprevents .
Some people may argue that if a carrier of a known genetic risk tells his or her relatives about the risk , he or she will be abandoned by families .
Nevertheless , this is not true as relatives or family members do help each another when one is in difficulty .
In contrast to abandon , they will give support and pay more attention to the patient .
These encouragement always makespatients to be more confident and brave , thus increasing their chances for survival in some cases .
Other than that , some people claim that a genetic disease patient will be discriminated from employment once his or her genetic information is spread by family members .
However , this is  .
There are countries where laws have been implemented to address such discrimination and to protect these genetic disease patients .
For example , according to the American Society of Human Genetics  ,abi the Disabilitiesto deal with employers involve in genetome of the states also have legislation to limit employers to collect , use and disclose genetic information .
In conclusion , a carrier of known genetic risk is obligated to tell their relatives due to their right to know about the risk and possibility to save their lives .
With effective implementation of laws to protect genetic disease patients , they should always be encouraged and prompted to reveal the genetic test results to his or her relatives so that they can benefit from the testing equally .
Genetic testing enables the discovery of possible genetic disorders present in the individual .
The information on the genetic disorder is important to the relatives as they may be implicated .
Although this information might cause family members to suffer emotionally and psychologically , it also alloe despondent in life .
However , this result of family members being informed should not be a reason to stop the individual from informing the family members .
There are counselors and specialists who will aid the individual and family members in recovering .
.
These professionals will also share information to the family members and allow them to be more prepared for the future .
keptIn conclusion , the individuals carrying genetic risk should be obligated to inform their family members as they should be responsible and fair to their family members and not depriving the members from taking early measures against the disease .
Furthermore , they should not be concerned about the negative effects about revealing the results as there are professionals in the fields who are available to aid in the problem .
but to the family members as well .social issuesWith advanced technology , genetic testing is developed to identify and detect changes in proteins , chromosomes or genes that are associated pany and employers and families pany and employment  .

In conclusion , even though a carrier of a known genetic risk has the right to disclose his or her condition , the disadvantages far outweigh the advantages .
Proper family planning , encouragement from relatives and the awareness of the genetic risk in their family are crucial and therefore the carrier should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Genetic testing is a type of medical test that identifies changes in chromosomes and genes and the results can determine a person's chance of developing or passing on inherited disorders like Huntington's disease and cancer .
Hoe the difficulties he pany .
The obligation to make knopanies fortable working with genetic counselors who can provide information about the pros and cons of the genetic test and discuss the social and emotional aspects of testing to undergo genetic tests and disclose the results that contribute to better management of health care and life choices .
Motion: "Should a carrier of a knomonly used to detect any disorders or diseases that is present in our genes .
It is a method where the person's DNA is taken and isolated to test for the presence of any defects or a specific genes that could cause any future onset of disorders or diseases  .
Since the test involves genes and in general , every human has it , the carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Firstly , genetic testing helps to prevent further spreadhasdiseases in the family lineage .
In family lineage , family memarers and relatives are related .
If the carrier is known to have a genetic risk , there may be a chance where other family membersor relatives get that disorder or disease which may be found in their genes .
When they go for the testing , they are able to know if they are positr the presence of the specific defective gene .
This will then help other family members or relatives to plan ahead of their future generation .
For example , they are able to plan whether to start a family , the location and type of house to buy  , health , life and disability insurance , financial arrangements  and et cetera  .
Hence , the carrier should tell his or her relatives in order for them to make future plans and have a good family life .
Secondly , genetic testing allows oneself to be prepared upon knowing that a relative of theirs has a genetic risk .
This will allows them to take precautious and preventive measures about their health condition .
Some diseasethatt can be detected by genetic testinhaveike Marfan syndrome - a connective tissue disorder causing long limbs and heart defects  can be controlled and treated .
When the other family members or relatives have an early detection of such diseases like Marfan syndrome , they are able to take preventive measures early like consulting a doctor , take medications that could slow down the heart rate in order to prevent stress on the aorta and avoid having sports in prevention of injuring the heart  .

"The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in panies and employers based on the results obtained from genetic testing  .
Under this act , it prohibits employers from making unfavourable employment decisions and prohibits insurance companies from reducing insurance coverage .
Although some argue that genetic testing raises social issue , these individuals may face discrimination from employers , insurance providers and society .
It is more difficult for these individuals in applying for job employments and life and health insurance coverage .
As a result , they feel socially stigmatised .

Since the affected individual shares similar gene panies should adhere to , pared to those es into effect , thus leading to little or no drastic chaore's lifestyle .
An example would be neonatal screening for sickle cell disease , when an affected child is diagnosed with this disease at an early stage , it can reduce childhood mortality and morbidity  .
Although the knowledge that there is a chance that the relatives themselves or their future children can hageneshe same genetic disorder can cost them higher insurance premiums or even deny them of insurance coverage , there are regulations which can help them from being discriminated .
In America , there is the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act  which helps provide protection for those who have undergone genetic testing and are at risk for certain genetic disorder  .

the carrierIn conclusion , revealing of the genetic test result by the carrier of genetic risk is not only his responsibility to his family members; it also allows his relatives to have a chance of early detection of the disease and possible treatment as a result .
No doubt that this may bring emotional stress to the relatives , but if managed properly , the medical benefits that the relatives can get from the information outweigh this initial risk .
Therefore , carrier of a known genetic risk istakeated to tell his family members his genetic testing result .
Genetic Testing grants us the ability to determine an individual's paternity and his chances of getting a genetic disorder such as Downsnies .
Therefore , the carrier of a knopensation for any mishap that may or may not happen .
Raising premium for such individuals is seen as taking advantage of them .
Also , employers may stereotype these individuals as non-productive and inefficient workers and choose not to hire them  .
Therefore , the carriers of genetic disorder should not be obligated to reveal the results to anyone to prevent from having to face discriminations at societal level .
Proponents in favour for the revealing of results argue that revealing the results to third parties such as relatives can aid in emotional support .
Relatives can provide necessary help to the carriers by providing more care and concern .
This is necessary because carriers of genetic disorders undergo tremendous stress and it would be great if there is someone close to be there with them to face altheir humandrightroblems .
Furthermore , revealing the results to the relatives can encourage them to be more health conscious and also to remind that to take go for frequent checkups since they might run the risk of having the same disorder too  .
However , this does not apply to all individuals and there is a possibility that they may even face discriminations from their own family members and relatives .
Some may feel that the individuals are likely to be a burden to them and may start to shun or keep away from them , causing them to feel even more upset or depressed .
Therefore , the final decision on whether to reveal the genetic testing results should lie in the hands of the carriers themselves .
In conclusion , the revealing of genetic testing results may bring more problems than solutions to the individual and therefore they should be given the final say in whether to reveal the results .
Many problems such as discrimination and psychological stigmatisation attributed from the release of genetic testing should be taken into consideration when deciding whether to rthe courtsthe genetic testing results as they can worsen an individual's health condition .

Genetic Testing and the Family .
Journal of Mid/articles/artGenDisc .php
Firstly , it is their responsibility to tell the relatives the result of the genetic test .
According to the article Genetic testing is all in the family by Jeffery P . Kahn , Director of Centre for Bioethics , University of Minnesota , the family has the right to know the result of the genetic test of any member in the family .
Since the whole family shares the same set of genes , the information the individual provides through the genetic testing may have just as much meaning for the family as for him or herself  .
Therefore , these results should be told , no matter they are good or bad .
However , some may claim that the individuals have the right to protect their privacy  , and like other private information , genetic information should be protected properly , and people have the final say whether to reveal it to others .
However , here there is something more important than privacy .
Genetic disorder only can be treated if those carriers of a known genetic risk decide to reveal their genetic result .
Moreover , we can only protect our children from inherited disease if we know whether there is a genetic risk .
As a result , the carriers of a known genetic risk should tell their relatives .
Secondly , it ensures that those carriers of genetic risk get the best ctechnologiesamily and society if they are willing to tell the test results .
As we all know , genetic disorder is not contagious and there is no risk for those people who want to offer help .
However , sometimes when there is high pressure , like knowing they are having genetic disorder , the individuals cannot make decisions properly , while their family and professional can take good care of them and make the best decision for them  .
Someone may claim that other people's decision may lead potential dangers for the person concerned  , since we are not them and cannot know exactly what they need .
However , as known to all , a group with several professionals will have more knowledge and experience than the individual , and the family members of the carriers will selflessly take care of them .
Therefore it is better for the carriers to tell their relatives the test results .
if it isTo draw a conclusion , for the carriers of genetic risk , it is better to tell the genetic test results to their relatives because it is an action not only showing their responsibility to the family and society , but also ensuring that they can get the best care .

an individual'shere is not a need to reveal individuals' genetic test result as individuals can ask their paretheytive to undergo genetic testing without revealing their result . 
The human genome project , begun in 1990 , was an ambitious project with the aim of sequencing the 3 billion human DNA and identifying the genes present in these DNA .1 It is no doubt that this project is one of the most successful achievements in the field of biotechnology .
The information gathered enables one to know how the genetic makeup of human correlate to a particular cause of disease .1 However the availability of such tests has brought about other ethical issues , like should the results be announced to the carrier of known genetic risk to his relatives .
I believe this is an issue of personal privacy and rights , the carrier should not have any obligation to inform anyone unless he wishes to do so .
A Carrier With a Knoe of bearing a heavy burden alone can be very serious that the person may end up devastated by the psychological disease rather than the genetic disease .
Sharing the result with relatives can indeed relieve the burden and fight against the disease or disorder together .
An additional gain is that family members would be considerate and would save money for the carrier's medical expenses in future .
Some may say that the reveal of the result would cause tension within the family , it is yet true .
However , if one thinks it positively , it can in fact share the tension of that carrier with his or her family so that he or she does not have to carry it alone .
After all , love of family is the greatest thing one can rely on .
bya certainIn conclusion , t be obligatfor someo tell his or her relatives the result of genetic testing their benefit and of course the carrier's own benefit .

Genetic testing is a scientific process that studies changes in chromosomes , genes or proteins .
Confirming or ruling out a suspected genetic condition or determine a person's chance of developing or passing on a genetic disorder depends on the results of the genetic test .
As there are ethical , legal and social concerns panies may make use of the information about genetic tests while ignoring the issue of privacy and confidentiality .
For example , if an employer discovers that the chance that an employee is diagnosed with Huntington's disease is high , the employer may not retain the employee .
As a result , individuals may be discriminated against by employers or be denied needed and deserved insurance coverage .
This is extremely unfair to an individual by discriminating against his genetic predispositions because we cannot control our genes .
Hence , the carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to inform his relatives for fear of information being leaked out , which can lead to potential discrimination .
Secondly , an implication in revealing the results leads to the threat of eugenics  .
Childbearing decisions are based on genetic information , thus adding social or political pressure on people .
Reproduction is encouraged between those presumed to have inheritable desirable traits while those have genetic defects are discouraged to reproduce .
For example , if you discovered that you had inherited the Huntington's disease mutation , you would decide not to have children of your own so as not to risk passing the gene on to your children .
In addition , relatives may encourage women carrying foetuses with genetic abnormalities to go for abortion .
Thus , these women may develop feelings of guilt and depression and affect their well-being .
Therefore , the carrier should not be obligated to tell our relatives about the genetic risk .
Lastly , it is a violation of basic human rights when the carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to inform his relatives  .
The individual has privacy right to decide if he wants others to know of his genetic condition .
For example , if the individual feels that he will be strongly stigmatized anthose whoginalized or once his relatives know of his genetic condition , they will treat him differently or abandon him as he is "tarnished" by a deadly gene , he may not want his relatives to know of his genetic condition , for fear of information being circulated .
In other words , by making it an obligation to inform his relatives , it is an intrusion of his right to privacy .
On the other hand , critics argue that by revealing results of the carrier of known genetic risk to his relatives , this will benefit the relatives' health and wethe privacyg greatly .
Preventive measures can be taken before symptoms of the inherited disorder develop  .
However , this is based on the assumption that peoplemarginalized ,tic and they will undergo treatments upon knowing that the disorder is treatable .
But what about disorders for which no preventive measures or treatments are available ?
Most people will despair and are reluctant to undergo treatments .
Moreover , some people tend to worry too much about their genetic disorder and this may ultimately lead to depression .
After all , revealing the results to his relatives may not be useful .
In addition , some critics argue that revealing results to relatives will helpa known to make informed choices about their future .
For example , if the carrier of a known genetic risk has borne the burden of having a strong family history of genetic disorder for years may feel relieved when he receives a positive test result .
By revealing the results to his relatives , they no longer have to live with uncertainty about their future and their children's future .
In this way , they can plan for their future and for those couples who want to have children of their own may think twice  .
However , I beg to differ .
By revealing results to relatives , those with children may feel a sense of guilt as they are worried that they could have pass the genetic disorder to their children .
Thus , this adds stress to the relatives and is not beneficial by revealing the results .
passedfuture ,In conclusion , the carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives as this is an intrusion of privacy and they will be faced with the threats of genetic discrimination and eugenics .
By revealing the results , these implications greatly outweigh the benefit of improving health and well-being of others .
The individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in whether or not in order to avoid bankrupt , they would reduce or just cancel their coverage on the genetic problems .
For the employment institutions , in order to keep high efficiencies on the output , they would reject employees with genetic problems .
And for a normal society , that would be quite unfair .
the individualreceiveIn conclusion , individuals should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing since that would bring about serious problems , such as individual depression and social discrimination .
The decision to undergo genetic testing can only be made by the individual at risk for a disorder .
Once a test has been conducted and the results are knomunity being confirmed of it are the reasons that lead to an individual being deemed at risk .
In considering these three factors , I feel that a carrier of a knomunity getting a similar disorder is increasing , a person can be at risk too .
The classic example of this kind of disorder is the sickle-cell anaemia .

as forIn conclusion , the obligation of a carrier of a known genetic risk to reveal the results to one's relatives could assist them in adapting to changes in their lives and allow researchers to find a cure for a particular genetic disorder .
Furthermore , the negative social consequences faced by the carrier have been minimized by law .
Thus , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
and prenatal testingcan alsocaused bydisease and diabetesdiseasesGenetic testing has developed well and it is getting popular nomon disease such as coronary heart disease , diabetes are caused polygenic mutation  .
In addition , this testinare caused can be used to determine a child's biological father or a person's ancestry .
Examples of genetic tests are nees to an end and undergoes mental trauma and depression .
acquiresfindsundergoesis calledHumans have ale of them having the mutated genes .
This is a good move as the family nobat having heart disease .
Homunity explain more .
Other than that the risk genes carriers may be discriminated  .
With these concerns in mind , the individual may not agree to tell the family members the information they acquired through genetic testing .
But by withholding the information , the risk genes carthe same mutated or defective geneself but to his or her family members .
Without tmeansng the family members , the individual might be suffering in silence and no support are givena hundred family members .
On the other hand if the risk genes carrier never meansrms the family members , the family members may suffer the same fathe other underlying problems areomino effect on the family lineage .
Therefore the to be obliged to tell the family members is act of beneficence as the risk gene carrier is doing good in informing the faAll such information they may face .
In conclusion , it is very important for the risk genes carrier to inform the family members as he or she may help the family members to avoid huge medical problems which may be avoided if only he or she inform them .
Therefore the risk gene carrier should be obligecounteractll the family members if he or she has genetic risk within them .
As science and technology progress , we can now detect the presence of any genetic disorder in an individual through genetic testing .
The purpose of genetic testing is to identify changes in chromosomes , genes , or proteins which are associated with inherited disorders .
However , one biggest problem that arises is whether the individual , who has undergone the genetic test , be obligated to inform his family members/relatives of the results .
I believe that the individual is obligated to tell his family members/relatives the test result as it is ethical for the individual to inform them and they can seek early medical assistance if needed .
The feelings of guilt and anxiety that arise from  can be minimized by going for counseling .
Firstly , family members/relatives deserve a right to know what kind of genetic disorder they might have inherited from the individual or running in their family line .
Thus , it is ethical for the individual to inform them .
This is important for parents who are doing family planning , as it help them to know whether an unborn child will have a genetic condition .
In this example , a pregnant relative seeking genetic counseling and his geneticist requires information about the individual in order to give her the most accurate information whether her new-born will have any risk of genetic disorder .
If the individual declines her request as he wants  the information about his genetic status to be confidential , her new-born could be in a high risk of getting the genetic disorder  .
Secondly , acquisition of genetic information of a carrier by his/her relatives can help reduce the possibility of getting the disease .
For example , if the genetic disorder is colon cancer , they can seek  medical advice and treatment while it is at an early stage .
If the disease has not developed , steps like making changes to their health habits can be taken which might lower their chance of getting the disease  .
Thus , this information can help them in making informed choices about their future .
Critics have also raised the psychological and emotional issues that the individual and his relatives may experience after he tells them the genetic test result .
His relatives might blame him for 'passing' the genetic disorder to them , causing the individual to feel guilty .
However , being the carrier , he too is a victim of this genetic disorder which was probably passed down from his parents .
In addition , his relatives will understand better by going for counseling that everyone carries gene mutations that can lead to diseases , and no one has control over what they pass on to their children  .
Relatives of the individual will also face a great deal of anxiety that they may have the genetic disorder .
However , they can choose not to be told of the test result in the first place or go for a genetic testing to confirm whether they have the genetic disorder .
If the genetic test result shows that the genetic disorder is not present in them , it can provide them a sense of relief .
Furthermogivey could also undergo counseling to help them manage their emotions better  .
In conclusion , I believe that the carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his relatives .
It is ethically right for the individual to inform his relatives , and the relatives after knowing that they may have the genetic disorder can seek out medical assistances to reduce the occurrence/severity of the disease .
The psychological and emotional issues can be minimized by going for counseling as they will understand the genetic disorder and manage their emotions better .
Should a carrier of a knomon antibiotic treatment has the ability to cure genetic diseases such as Cystic Fibrosis , a type of genetic lung disease .
From the Georgina Advocate news  , "Emily Gough , who died last year of Cystic Fibrosis , was seen with her father , Glenn , and sister , Jessica , who is now battling the same disease" .
In this article , the Gough family is battling against a genetic lung disease .
Unfortunately , Emily Gough and her father died because they did not detect the disease early enough to cure it .
Such tragic incident will re-occur if a carrier of a known genetic risk were to hide his or her condition from his or her family members and relatives .
Proper plans for the future could be made if a carrier knows in advance that he or she has a genetic disease .
Oregon National Primate Research Center successfully came up with a technique that could stop future generations from inheriting genetic diseases from their parents .
If a carrier of a genetic risk were to hide his or her condition , the genetic disease defectivetinue to run in the family line , passing down to future generations .
Proper financial plans could be mIffa geneticon were to know early if he or she has a genetic disease and avoid impending financial crisis ifa highor she is able borrow money or apply for financial help earlier .
A possible excuse people choose to hide their affliction is because they are afraid of the discrimination they would face from their family members and relatives .
After all , the burden of carrying a genetic disease is not something that one would want to make known to others .
Perhaps a better reason for people to keep the problem to themselves is because they are not aware that genetic diseases are not isolated to just themselves .
This is a case of ignorance in which is not at all bliss .
wouldThere is no good reason for a genetic disease carrier to hide his or her condition from his or her family members or relatives if the person is aware of the implication of the genetic disorder .
This is a question of morality .
A person who understands his role and responsibility as part of a family would not want to see his future generation be it his own , or his immediate families' to suffer from genetic diseases that could otherwise have been prevented if he had discussed his condition .
The reasons to inform out weigh the reasons not to , hence , a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives .
The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in es more and more popular , the moral issues around it have also been revealed in face of the mass public .

Genetics plays the role in every disease .
Genetic testing informs individuals and family of their genetic status; this knowledge may enable them to take adaptive measures against a genetic disease  , if the disease is treatable .
One is morally obligated to inform the relatives of the genetic test results since family members generally inherit the same set of genetic codes from their parents .
Firstly , informing relatives allows them to take preventive measures against diseases .
Having the same parents can mean that certain disease can run within the family and they are morally obligated to warn their relatives of the possible hazards that may trigger disease , for example , to prevent relatives from eating fava beans when one is detected to have G6PD deficiency .
One can even educate relatives of the preventive measures of certain diseases .
For example , to educate relatives to eat less fatty meals when their genes predispose too weak blood vessels integrity that are prone to rupture .
However , some argue that genetic testing can potentially unravel family secrets , namely adoptions and illegitimate child  .
But such issues can be solved since we can select results to be in termteststentfind outnstead of pdiseasesy testing .
Therefore , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives for the betterment of the relatives to take preventive measures and also be equipped with related knowledge to save their own lives .
himself or herselfThe advent of genetic testing has created a scientific breakthrough in identifying risk factors for disease .
The increasing amon consensus is that every individual should have the final decision on plication .
complicationsSome may argue that it is the individual's right as to munication relationshto inform
Arguments brought forward by opponents claimed that the personal rights of the individual are being violated .
This is a bias claim because it failed to consider at-risk relatives' rights to know about the test results .
RelativGeorgetowne rights to be informed of the results because they are prone to inheriting the same disease or disorder which can be fatal if discovered too late .
When individuals chose not to reveal the results , it is mainly because of the following reasons: the fear of discrimination , fear of being a burden to the family or not wanting to worry their families .
This is a selfish thinking and is an illogical way of avoiding the problem .
The failure of disclosure of genetics test results frequently cause relatives to be enraged and upset , and this had lead to numerous lawsuits against the genetics provider , as they felt that it should be these genetic providers' responsibilities to inform them , but in fact is the responsibility of the person being tested  .
Thus detrimental effects on both parties can be seen due to the failure of disclosing genetic test results to relatives .
an individualIn conclusion , individuals should be obligated to reveal such information to their relatives because it is a personal responsibility , and can lead to improvement of their well-being .
Moreover , relatives should also be informed about the potential dangers of inheriting such disorders so that they are able to make choices and decisions that can change their future for the better .
Through technological advancement and intense scientific research , genetics strives to be one of the most lucrative and beneficial medical sectors .
Through genetic testing , an individual e the stress if the genetic disorder turning into a medical condition .
worrySecondly , by telling his or her relatives , the carrier e such trying times .
After knofort that they are overcoming the problem together .
With regards to the health conditions , having family and relative support also help in taking care of each other physically should medical conditions develop .
Some may be concerned that relatives might reject the risks and in turn discriminate the carrier for his or her genetic disorder especially if the developed illness is communicable .
Yet we could not undermine the power of family bonds and the support they can give .
The situation of discrimination is subjective and does not amount to a general trend in family relationships .
Lastly , the carrier is required to conform to the ethical and legal obligations in which genetic testing results is needed to be revealed in certain situations .
The American Society of Clinical Oncology concurs that disclosure may be permitted if the carrier refuse to disclose the information; the disease caused by the disorder is highly probable to occur , serious , yet preventable and treatable or with early monitoring could reduce its risk .
.
With that the medical personnel would disclose the information to the relatives in view of the medical concerns that may arise .
It is also ethical to inform the relatives so that he or she can minimize the emotional trauma inflicted to the relatives if they would to find out that the genetic disorder previously unidentified had turning into an illness .
This is especially so since they are part of the family and not strangers .
In conclusion the carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives for the benefit of their future .
The carrier should inform them of the health implications , to gain emotional support and to adhere to the ethical and legal obligations .
It is true that the decision of revelation lies with the carrier which means that more care should be taken when making a decision with the benefit of the relatives in mind .
Genetic testing is a process in which a one's DNA or an embryo}'s DNA} is abstracted and examined for the existence of particular genes} or deficiency that could signify the future attack of certain disease .
When an individual is tested positive as a carrier of a particular known genetic risk , such as 1 antitrypsin deficiency- where an insignificant adjustment in the style of living can prevent one from an "early death"  , or Huntington's disease-where there is no approach to change the consequences of the result  , he or she will be in a state of dilemma- should he or she be obliged to inform his or her family members ?
Some suggested that when one's relatives are informed of the result , it can cause additional anxiety on the relatidilemmaned and invade on their lives , thus the positive result should not be disclosed to one's relatives .
However , by informing ones' relatives of the result not only allow them to escape from early deaths through small adjustments in their lifestyles but also ensure the safety of third parties .
Thus , the reveal of the result to relatives has effectuated significant advantages .
Hence , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Firstly , when the relatives of a carrier of a known genetic risk are informed of the positive test result , the chance of early deaths of the relatives is minimised .
This is because certain genetic diseases may be accentuated by external factors .
When an individual is made known to the external factors , he or she can make adjustments to his or her daily lifestyle .
Consequently , the chance of an early death due to the genetic disease is reduced since one is not exposed to the decisive risk factor .
For instance , one is tested positive for 1 antitrypsin deficiency- a genetic disease in which smoking is the decisive risk factor  .
When the carrier informed his or her relatives of the positive result , the relatives can restrain themselves from smoking .
This not only minimises the chance of them developing the disease but more importantly reduces the chance of dying early .
Secondly , the reveal of the result to relatives ensures the safety of third parties .
When one is tested positive for genetic diseases which can cause one to expose others to danger , one should reveal the result to his or her relatives .
This is because one's relative could be in professions such as train conductor , air traffic controller and airline pilot  .
These relatives might have a condition that would hamper their job performance in such a way as to expose other people to danger  .
For example , one is tested positive for Huntington's disease- a disease that causes rampant movements .
When one's relative is in a particular profession such as airline pilot and the relative is not informed of the positive result , he or she will continue in his or her profession .
However , the relative might not be able to control his or her movements while on the midst of controlling the aeroplane due to the Huntington's disease .
This may cause a disastrous accident which results in the death of many passengers .
Meanwhile , this disastrous accident may be prevented if the relative is informed of the result by the carrier .
This is because the relative may go for genetic testing and if one is confirmed to have the disease , he or she will not continue in his or her profession and thus will not expose others to danger .
Hence , the reveal of the testing result ensures the safety of third parties .
It has been claimed that the disclosure of the testing result can create unnecessary distress on the relatives concerned and may invade radically on their lives .
However , the relatives might have significant effects if they are not informed of the result .
This is because they might make themselves vulnerable to the decisive risk determinants of any particular genetic disease  .
If they are informed of the result , they might avoid the risk of developing the disease .
Thus , the consequences of being informed of the result are more preferable than staying in ignorance .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives as it not only allows them to escape from early death through changes in their lifestyles but also contributes to the safety of third parties .
Genetic testing is a medical test , using blood or tissue from a patient that can definitively determine if a mutation in the genome of the patient is causing a specific disease  .
The testing reveals many types of diseases and disorders such as Huntington's disease , cancer and Dopany the patient all along the way for them to accept the fact as a carrier of the disorder .
Through the support and care provided by family members , patients could accept the genetic risk eventually .
Thus , a carrier of the genetic risk should tell his or her family members .
Other than that , the patient should tell the result of the test to their family members because family members act as patient advocate role  .
This will benefit the patient as the family members will think all sort of ways to ensure patient receives all necessary care .
They will question the health care team and try to get more information for the patient .
These help the patient to decide the best treatment for them .
For exampush patient that has cancer can undergo several treatments to control the spread of the cancerous cells .
In this case , family members who have the information of the treatment can help the patient to decide the best treatment for the patient .
Conversely , if the patient has not tell the family members the result of the genetic test , the patient will be definitely in lost and irrational in making decision .
Therefore , a carrier of genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her family members .
Opponents may argue that a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives due to the principles of confidentiality and privacy  .
They claimed that a carrier should have the rights to keep the result .
This is because the carrier thinks that revealing the result of the test will affect the life of the whole family .
It will create tension for the family .
However , the family members have the rights to know the result .
Since some of the genetic diseases and disorders are hereditary , therefore there are potential risks for the family members to inherit the disease .
The result should be revealed to them in order to be faired to them .
They have the rights to prevent and ensure their safety .
Betold carriers themselves will be in an unstable emotion condition upon knowing the result .
They are unable to make decision rationally .
Thus , the result should be told to their relatives .
Hence , the relatives can make rational decision for the patient and this probably what the patient needs the most .
a rational In conclusion , relatives play an instrumental role to help the patient in facing the genetic disease .
They support , care and advocate the patient .
The issue of privacy should be put aside since the benefits of the patient are on priority .
Thus , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Genetic testing can be classified as a medical test that detects changes in the genes , chromosomes or proteins .
The testing is usually done to find changes related es to releasing the results of the test .
In my opinion , the carrier of a knoe up mend alternative medicine or a specialist doctor which in turn can increase his chance to recover .
it isdoesHowever , there has also been some suggestions that the carrier of a certain genetic disease who knows it through genetic testing should not be obligated to tell his family members as he will be discriminated and sometimes even be treated as an outcast in his family .
Nevertheless , he should be mentally prepared and thinks positively as eventually his family members will surely accept him as blood is always thicker than water .
In conclusion , a person should be obligated to reveal his genetic testing's results as it has more advantages in doing so than disadvantages as encouragement from his family and family planning is crucial to a person with genetic disorder .
What munity .
Hence , people should not have the final say in panies .
Besides , if an insurance agent knows the results of a particular customer , then salesmen will try to avoid offering insurance service to one who has some kind of genetic disorder .
Instead , they will spare no effort to sell insurance to the healthy population .
In a word , genetic testing may lead to a genetic discrimination in employment and insurance industry  .
Moreover , even if people know their results of genetic testing , usualindividualse able to do very little nothings .
It is because genetic testing cannot predict how severely one person will be affected by the disordered genes .
What is can do is only detecting whether there are any genetic problems .
Also , for most kinds of the genetic disorders , the medical technology nowadays is not capable of curing them  .
Therefoon , personally viewing of the results of genetic testing will cause a lot of problems to society .
Actually , whether individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in revealing thediagnosed with such testing is a heated controversy in society today .
While the genetic testing can assist people in predicting and ruling out some genetic disorders and problems which are hard to be find in daily life , it will still bring about some difficult problems to human beings to some extent .
Hence , the individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
Advancements in medical science have led to an increase in the number of people undergoing genetic testing .
They go through medical tests to detect changes in their genes , thus identifying the possibility of them or their related-family member developing a inherited disorder  .
As such , a controversy occurs as to munity if an individual is unapared to others .
withprecautions There are those who feel that an individual of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to inform his/her relatives as genetic results is private and of high confidentiality  .
While it is true that genetic test result are confidential , in the case where another life is at risk , we should be more considerate and help save another life .
problemsIn conclusion , an individual of a known genetic risk should be obligated to inform his/her relatives as both ethical and social implications will occur .
Besides that , RFID technology is also important in the healthcare industry as it can save lives  .
Dull and monotonous proceduduced and patients would not feel trapped or isolated and be more carefree  .
For example , patients are tagged with RFID wristbands that contain information about their health conditions , medications , drug allergies and microchips that enable healthcare professionals to monitor the patients  .
If any of the patients experience any difficulties such as breathlessnesable to track the patient and immediately attend to him or her .
This saves time and can tially save a life .
Since RFID thefttes procedures such as protecting the patients from danger , it reduces the amount of personal contacts between patients and nurses  .
Information on patients' diseases and surgeries can also be obtained from the RFID systemnds .
Reports can be accessed by the healthcare professionals such as the doctors and nurses without a hassle .
Further medical treatments can be conducted if another doctor reads the reports .
Thus , reportsHowever , there are arguments that are against the use of RFID technology in monitoring and tracking people and animals despite the benefits gained .
One of the arguments that have been brought up is the difficulty in reading the information provided by the RFID tags incorporated in liquids and metal products  .
These substances may reflect the radio waves which make the information hard to read .
The RFID tags also have to be placed in proper positions , taking into account its angles and alignment in order to obtain a proper reading .
This can be quite a hassle and it requipatientnexperiences .
However , RFID tags are usually placed in an area with optimum frequency which enables the RFID readers to obtain the information contained in the tags correctly .
Active RFID tags which are such proceduresthat protectcse the range of frequency of a system can be used to solvcontactroblem .
Hence , the use of RFID technology would still be effective and beneficial to us .

In my opinion , these surveillance technologies should not be used to track people .

Even tHowever , workersigh security level can bcheckseloped , there will always be loopholes .
The best way to prevent the leaall ofge of per;otheylusuallya is not to use it .

In conclusion , due to the privacy , unimportane of using these technologie , confidentiality of data and health threat , surveillance technology such as RFID  should not be used patientsople
Over the years as technology advances , the improvement in surveillance technology such as Radio-frequency identification  and surveillance cameras has brought about the increase in usage of such technology .
Surveillance technology refers to the technology developed for observers to keep track of activities done by the observed .
Such technology is ed immigrants panies first started introducing the implantation of RFID chips into the body of their employees , protests pany override the right of human beings .
Therefore in this case , it is difficult to determine whether surveillance technology should or should not be used to track people .
Furthermore , the use of surveillance technology may result in adverse psychological impacts on human beings .
The open-street camera surveillance that has been used widely by many countries in current society is likely to result in an unhealthy psychologicalposeact on the citizens of the country .
Knowing that every mo stress and uneasy , and this will in turn affects his behavior .}
Societal surveillance may too give rise to "mistrust between citizens and citizens and the state ."}
Due to this negative consequence in this case , surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
hospitalsIn conclusion , with the positive impacts outweighing the negative consequences of using surveillance technology to track people , I will not agree to the statement that such technology should not be us to track people .
The use of surveillance technology such as RFID  to track people should be banned .
Technological advances in the recent century have led to many improved methods to trace people .
Surveillance technology is parison to a RFID tag .
This pletely effective in preventing it  .
Further research needs to be done to make the shielding techniques safer for consumers .
Therefore , RFID technology should be banned for the safety of consumers .
There is a need to prohibibanned technology as it indirectly intrudes one's life and privacy .
Nomitting crimes like kidnapping .
Hopanies which have decided to use RFID technology to keep track of its workers or products have to purchase thousands of RFID readers to cover all their workplaces and factories  .
In addition , each RFID tag is rather expensive hence it is not practical to be used in large quantity to identify both people and products  .
Due to the impracticality of RFID technology , RFID technology should not be used to track people .
Though the use of RFID technology has its merits such as crime prevention , it should still be because tsecurelyf surveillance technology such as RFID to track people not only infiltrate one's privacy; it is also not cost effective and likely to result in data theft and data loss .
Surveillance technology such as RFID to track people plays a crucial role in preventing the criminal activities as well as monitoring threats .
RFID tags can be inserted into the wristbands which can be worn by the parolees or the prisoners and cannot  be removed .
According to Taipei Times newspaper , it was claimed that the sexual assault parolees should wear the RFID tags in order to trace their whereabouts  .
During the releasing perbe cases that the parolees will escape and flee to the bent so that the law enforcers could not fincanm .
Thus , attaching RFID tags on them can easily track them .
If they intend to run away , the police can get to know their locations and arrest them at once .
Apart from the RFID tags , GPS can be applied to investigate the criminal activities such as murder cases , robbery and serious corruption  .
Undeniable , surveillance technology tUndeniablyople will lead to loss of privacy .
However , protecting the privacy in this situation is not more important than letting the offenders to violate the laws and threaten our ves .
In conclusion , the advantages of using surveillance technology far  outweigh its disadvantages .
Surveillance technology should be used in a correct way to improve human's life and not to lead to dehumanization .
So , I do not agree that there should be a ban in using surveillance technology to track people .
Technological advances have eased the execution of surveillance activities .
Some have claimed that the application of surveillance technology is advantageous in the safeguard of credentials , protection of national security and in the help of speed border crossings  .

Another concern from some people is that with RFID , the government and some intelligent institutions will easily know where we are if we are implanted with RFID .
In my point of view , this worry can be handled by making correspondforlaws to regulate the use of RFID .
For example , people themselves will have the right to decide whether to use RFID or not , and in this way their privacy will not be invaded .
What is more , it is also not practical to get everybody implanted with RFID , since it will cost a lot .
To sum up , RFID is a useful technology and like each tour dailylogy , it has its pros and cons .
The question lies in the appropriate use of RFID .
Since RFID has so many advantages that bring us efficiency and convenience , and the negative effects RFID might bring about such as invasion of privacy could be offset , the use of RFID should not be banned .

However , there is a concern that implant chips can hurt people and lead to some unexpected consequences .
Actually , not all type of surveillance use this method since we can use cards , cameras and other modern devices instead .
In case we have to use implant chips , it will be designed and made carefully that it will not hurt the users .
Another worry in the use of this technology that whenever a hacker can get in the system , users are threatened as their personal information can be revealed  .
However , systems are made to be able to prevent hackers as well as store the information safely .
The privacy of tracked people will be maintained as long as possible .

Quick access to the lifestyle of a patient helps in effective diagnosis of the patient's diseases in the future .
Furthermore , surveillance technology can assist in monitoring potential threats .
In a more specific context , monitoring is crucial to suppress transnational crime .
Strict measures have been taken to detect and anticipate any potential terrorist attack .

on ourIn conclusion , it is evident that the use of surveillance technology ttotrack people should be banned as it not only threatens one's privacy inhibiting them from exercising freedom but the use of surveillance technology also poses unknown potential health hazards in individuals .
In addition , it creates suspicion in individuals causinget alher resulting in breaking of social relationship and family bonds .
Nevertheless , surveillance techitlogy has limited efficiency in crime prevention hence it should not be use to track people since it fails to protect us .
an individualsthe wholean emergencySurveillance technology such as RFID , GPS and security cameras are used to monitor the action of public .
After the September 11 attack , the use of such techthe public has become more prevalent so as to increase security level  .
It is also used to monitor those munity mothe securitys to ensure this is by surveillance technology and this has significantly helped Singapore to be one of the country with the lowest crime rates .
countriesOpponents of sua surveillanceechnology may argue that it overwrites individual's privacy .
However , it is nearly impossible to always protect an individual's privacy as it may overlap with ancriminalsdividual's human right .
In this case , if surveillance technology is not implemented so as to protect individual's privacy , millions of innocent lives may be in danger  .
Furthermore , the surveillance technology is only used fohavety .
Thus , there is no need to fear when visitis no crime done .
In additiosecuree are laws and regulation that is implemented to prevent the abuse of such technology .
Secondly , surveillance technology has been proven to be effective for social control as it helps to monitor those who needs special attention such as Alzheimer's patients .
Mary Barnes , the president of Alzheimer's Community Care , believes that RFID chip implanted in Alzheimer's patients allow medical facilities and information to be quickly and easily accessible for them  .
Together with GPS , it is also able to track their location and detect if they are in danger .
This can also be used for other patients that requires special attention like heart and lung disease especially when it involves children and older generation .
This is useful as the caretaker may not be able to attend these patients 24 hours a day .
Thus , RFID help to ease their work but increase the efficiency simultaneously .
One may argue that the RFID chips might have side-effects on the patient's health .
It has been said that the RFID mighneedd to cancer .
However , there is no strong scientific evidence to show that it is harmful to the patient's health .
According to TIME magazine article written by Morrissey , a study conducted in 2006 showed that 4% of the 1 ,260 mice implanted with RFID developed tumors .
However , none of them are malignant .
In addition , Dr McGill said "Even if you put in a bland piece of plastic , it will produce tumors in rats and mice ," .
Furthermore , the RFID tag has been approved by the U .S . Food and Drug Association .
werea TIMEIn conclusion , the benefits that surveillance technology has brought to the society is far more advantageous than its unclear disadvantages .
"Should the use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people  be banned ?"
Radio-frequency identification  technology has advanced from industrial and animal tagging applications to being able to track people's movements  .
Thiss  .
Hoplished by tagging employees panies made it compulsory for their staff to panies e domit crimes .
Prison violence was reduced by up to 60% in some United States prisons that had RFID installed  .
Furthermore , data retrieved from RFID readers can serve as evidence against suspects to solve crimes  .
Opponents of RFID technology argue that implanted RFID tags cause cancer .
Implanted RFID tags were observed to cause tumours in laboratory animals  .
This concern is not necessary , because external tags can be used .
Overall , RFID is effective and beneficial in reducing and solving crimes .
Thirdly , RFID allows optimal patient care and safety in hospitals .
Tracking of medical professionals allows them to receive notification immediately when a patient needs help .
Tracking of patienthave madesures patient's safety by noticing if the patient is at the right place at the right time .
For example , in the United States , South Tyneside District Hospital tagged newborns with RFID tags , and hid RFID readers at exit points  .
Unauthorized removal of baby would trigger the alarm thus enhancing baby safety  .
Currently , Tan Tock Seng Hospital is using ThermoSensors , a new RFID tag which is capable of patient location tracking and body temperature monitoring  .
This has enhanced patient care as nurses have more time for other patients and are notified immediately when patient has a fever  .
Unfortunately , there are several security and privacy concerns .
But , these concerns can be addressed by giving individuals the choice of using RFID technology and freedom to remove tags when desired  .
Hence , RFID should be used to enhance patient care and safety .
In conclusion , it is evident that RFID benefits the defense and healthcare sector .
It helps to enhance management , reduce crimes and enable optimal patient care .
Thus , thea lesser of RFID technology to track people should not be stopped .

Surveillance technology refers to the use of technology such as RFID  to observe the activities of certain people or things , in particular to gather information .
Apart from RFID , there are many types of surveillance technology such as computer , camera , mobile , aerial and biometric surveillance .
Although the use of surveillance technology , especially to track people , has raised many ethical issues because it intrudes people's privacy , I believe that it should not be banned .
Hoe an enormous threat to the security of many countries in the bat terrorism and RFID is one of its mean .
After the 9/11 World Trade Center attacks in Neputer system so that they can watch out and catch suspicious personals .
The welfare of the entire populations supersedes the individual rights for the case of terrorist attacks .
Thus , surveillance technology to track people should not be banned .
Fourthly , we have seen the application of surveillance technolas a deterrentalth care to tag its patients .
The purpose is to make sure the medical records actually tally with tof patients being described .
It can provide information such as patients' allergies and it is extremely crucial to ensure correct association .
Critics may argue that we can also use wrist bands in which there are barcodes on the patients .
However , there is a tendency that one makes mistakes in typmeanson a keyboard .
Thus , those prparentslabels are susceptible to errors so it is not that reliable .
Since we have a better technology to ensure the accuracy , I see no reason to ban such surveillance technology .
Moreover , patients are supposed to be monitored so privacy issues are no concern here .
In conclusion , surveillance technology should not be banned , buarease hapersonsake not of thebenefitss of its applications .
Its applications in child kidnapping , marathon races , security of a country and health care have brought great benefits to human beings .
The benefits actually supersede the violation of people's privacy or in some case it does not violate at all .
We have seen that the identification technology has progressed by leaps and bounds over the last febating theft and retrieving lost items in department stores .
Unlike barcodes , RFID do not need to be placed precisely relative to the scanner .

Public transportation systems worldwide use RFID enaed system to track and bill use of the services .
RFID chips are also being used in identificationtods in corporations and school to control unauthorized access .
One may argue that these can lead to potential infringement of confidentiality should one'spurposesal information leak out .
However , the worries are unnecessary since the increasingly secure and private operations that are being set up could reduce the possibility of unintended access to information .
"The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned ."
Cameras on streets , GPS  on vehicles , RFID  tags on products , animals and people , as bating crimes .
On the other hand , RFID tagging can also be used on patients for nurses or doctors to keep an eye on them in case they have inappropriate actions such as moving topromised , or to choose privacy over safety ?
Everyone has different perception on privacy .
Therefore its bias to say that surveillance technology threatens one's privacy to a huge extent .
Furthermore , mobile phones , WI-FI  as e a necessity rather than a burden as we cannot do without it .
In conclusion , surveillance technology has undoubtedly brought us great convenience despite the fact that one's privacy is marginally sacrificed .
Cameras have aided in many areas such as shops , traffic junctions and even within the household where parents can monitor theirwhile at work , ensuring that their children are safe and sound .
Hence , surveillance technology should not be banned as it is crucial in the modern society where there are threats around us and the only way to prevent such threats is through the use of such brilliant technology .
breachSurveillance is the process of monitoring  behaviours and activities , usually of people munities ,The extensiveance technology has in fact enabled to track the public's health , ensured the public safety and monitored the employees in companies .
Therefore , I fully agree thsystem) ,use of surveillance technology to track people should not be banned .
ratesdoctorsFirst of all , surveillance technology should not be banned as it has enabled the tracking of the health of the public .
By means of somatic surveillance , information like heart rate and hormone levels can be translated into data for medical purposes .
The implantation of RFID into the body facilitates the proper identification of hospital patients .
Besides that , it can supply detailed body information to hospitals and then the public can alter their behaviours like exercise and diet after  interpretation from doctors .
With the implants , RFID chips may convey  messages regarding health conditions of patients , such as those municate effectively plaints munities aids in reducing the mortality rate due to health problems and also decreasing the misinterpretation of verbal communication by the doctors .
"The use of surveillance technology such as Radiofrequency Identification  to track people should be banned ."

The increasing use of technology has done much for mankind .
It has changed many aspects of our lives and has subiquitously penetratedcn's nepany has its reasons to do so such as tracking their vehicles and also providing btter service to their customers .
Yet many have arguthey do it is against human rights and thus promote the banning of tracking devices .

.
Therefore , the use of tracking devices can actually bring about benefits if they are used pany's reaction time to each incident and thus help solve any problems that ply plete ban of the use of surveillance but adequate control by oneself or a governing body to restrict the abuse of this powerful tool .
Surveillance technology and security has become crucial to each country since the terrorist attacks in the US on Sept 11 .
Surveillance technology is the use of devices to monitor any behaviour , activities or other changing information that is deemed to be important to the security of any government or personnel .
But this has gone too far; promised and mittee to lossee this but e a signifPersonalnt problem in their dailthusives .
"Collhesitationf personal data  also reveals intimate aspects of the seusedto others promised information security , failure of implanted transponder , failure of inserter , failure of electronic scanner , electromagnetic interference , electrical hazards , magnetic resonance imaging incompatibility , and needle stick"  .
These not only causes the person's distress but also put the whole monitoring agency on high alert if the device malfunction .
Huge cost and time will be wasted and manpower will be mobilized just to rectify these unfortunate problems that arise from this .
Why should we waste money and time for this failure of surveillance technology ?
Its taxpayer's money we are talking about .
Don't the public have the right to dictate how the money should be generated and used ?
For the government worked for the people , not the other way around .
But this does not imply to certain countries that expect the people to work for them .
Lastly , the use of Surveillance technology can be abused by the governmhasand or any agency that used it .
The government can use it to track any opposition to its policies .
Like in the cexcuses , stilloit hasa during the apartheid period whereby opposing to the regime was monitor using the surveillance technology .
Thousand of opposition members were arrested and ill treated by the regime .
The situation became better when Nelson Mandela successfully became the president but at the price of he himself was the victim of their abuse .
Greed and corruption sink in when the people at the very top refuse to give up their power and used underhand means to keep themselves in power .
They will do anything and that does include using any surveillance device to monitor their nemesis .
With easy evidence at their disposal , they will use the law to suppress any opposition to their will .

staffa toola meansan accessSurveillance technology is the utilization of electronic equipment such as RFID , GPS , and CCTV to monitor the behavior of individuals or groups .
This technology is pany , or tool for identifying andequipment , staffs , and patients in a hospital .
In fact , there are still a lot of applications for RFID in various fields and industries including security , public transport , healthcare , and e-payment that its popularity is increasing rapidly .
Nevertheless , there are some problems and controversies surrounding the use of such technology despite the convenience it brings to the society .
Most concerns revolve around the issue of privacy and confidentiality since the technology is capable of collecting personal data about a person plications that may arise due to the use of RFID to track people .
For instance , personally identifiable information  such as license plate number of an individual carrying an RFID enabled card or travel document can be read by a third party pensate the concerns about privacy .
RFID tag embedded into items or products can help owners to track down their valuable belongings should their items be stolen or missing .
RFID also helps to identify disaster victims , and provide effective treatment for patients in emergency situation in a hospital .
While these may be true , without the restriction of the use of the technology , abusive use of the information may cost greatly .
In other words , RFID may be used to track people , but only limited to a certain degree .
For example , it is acceptable to track patients if the patients concerned really need it .
In conclusion , the use of surveillance technology to An RFIDk people should be restricted only to some special cases , as in the case of a dependent patient in a hospital who needs constant surveillance .
It is a breach of privacy to use thto technology for supervising and collecting personal and private information about an individual or group .
Moreover , any third party with appropriate equipment is able to read information from the individual concerned , which may eventually lead to the abusive use of the information .
Therefore , the restriction on the usage of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be wholly supported .

Based on the three reasons shotrackve , the RFID are not reliable enough to give correct informatiabout the tracked person .
Meanwhile , it may invade the users' privacy .
Finally , it is costly as well as unnecessary to tracking people .
Thus , it should be clear that tracking people trackshould be banned .

The use of surveillance technology to track people has become possible due to the advancement in technology .
Among the technologies available , radio- frequency identification  is emerging mainly due to its ability to transmit information wirelessly via magnetic fields as well as the possibility of low cost tag in the future .
.
Even though the use of RFID in human tracking could help to improve on the safety and security , there are several threats such as privacy and health hazardous that we needhazardsder .
Therefore , RFID should not be used to track on people when threatsutweigh the benefits of it .
The other main concern would be the health hazards .
According to some of the studies conducted  on tissue reactions to microchip implants in laboratory animals , 0 .8% to 10 .2% of laboratory mice and 2 dogs developed malignant tumors  caused by implant chips  .Although the tests were not done on humans ,  the result is relevant to humans as humans are naturally subject to malignant tumor in response to foreign body implant .
.One might argueOnet health hazardous could hazardsated if RFID tag is used to replace the implant chips .
Long term exposure to electromagnetic fields emitted by the antenna could be another health hazardous that chazardbe treated lightly .
In conclusion , RFID usage in human tracking is not as simple and beneficial as we may have thought of .
There are a lot of hidden threats such as privacy issue and health hazards which we should really consider .
Thus , RFID should not be used to track on people .

Title: The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned .
Technological advancement has made it possible to track people using electronic devices .
This inevitably has brought about many debates on the moral and ethical grounds .
There are viees at a heavy price; our privacy andgroundss .
Thus the using of surveillance tecbringy should not be allomon and it is actuallcomeonstration of lack of trust betpany .
Such devices enusethe management to keep an eye on the employees' activities making sure that it is in compliance pany guideline and performing their duties .
Homitment and motivation topany suffered as plications like allergies .
On the surface the devices ability to save life seems remarkable , but it has serious risks of being abused .
Medical history of a patient is confidential , and storing all these information on the RFID tag/chip risk leaking out these information .
It is actually technological feasible to steal such information patible tag/chip reader .
It is against one rights and privacy if such information got leaked , and prominent figures like celebrities and politicians are most likely the target of these hackers .
Nopanies to keep their effectiveness but also assist to secure public safety .
Hence , the use of surveillance technology such as RFID should be necessary .
With the advances in technology , the use of surveillance technology is inevitable .
This results in the controversy on muter trains  .
With surveillance technology , such incident can be prevented .
Thus , this results in a better security in the society .
Therefore , surveillance technology should be used to track people such as terrorists to ensure better security .
incidentsSurveillance technology results in safety in the medical sector .
RFID can be used to monitor patients promise for security and safety .
Hence , surveillance technology should be used to track people to allow better security and safety .
In conclusion , surveillance technology results in better security , safety and increases work efficiency .
The benefits of surveillance technology outweigh the problems .
Therefore , I do not agree that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
Humans have many basic needs and one of them is to have an environment that can sustain their lives .
Our current population is 6 billion people and it is still gromodate more number of people modate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system .

Identification has become more and more important in our society .
Thanks to biometric identification , nopanies concern .
On one hand more and more virus and hack can access personal computers , so the secret data and documents may be stolen .
On the other hand , some important departments need strict administration to their members to avoid information leaks .
The United States Department of Defense  Common Access Card} is a successful use of biometric identification .
This card contains biometric data to add security and reduce the risk of falsification  .

Nuclear technology has come a long way since Ernest Rutherford first split the atom in 1917 .
The subsequent realization that the additional neutrons produced from fission reaction could induce a nuclear chain reaction has sparked off widespread interest in nuclear technology .
Since then , nuclear technology has been exploited for wars and  arms races and has found many applications in the medical , industrial and energy fields .
When uranium fission was discovered in 1938 , it sparked widespread scientific interest due to the massive amount of energy released by the reaction .
However most American physicists were still skeptical that it could be turned into a bomb or an energy source .
However , with the world on the brink of war , military considerations would accelerate the development of nuclear technology beyond the imagination of the initial skeptics .
Following fears that Nazi Germany was developing nuclear weaponry , the Manhattan Project was initiated in the United States .
The project eventually grew to include over thirty sites across America dedicated to nuclear research .
The research effort culminated in "Fat Man" and "Little Boy" , two atomic bombs that were dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima respectively .
Although wartime nuclear research brought about nothing but devastation and death , President Eisenhower's "Atoms for Peace" speech would set the world off on the road of peaceful pursuit of nuclear energy .
The development of nuclear technology was also heavily influenced by public opinion , especially after disastrous accidents occurred in nuclear power stations .
The steady growth of nuclear power in the 1960s was hampered by the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in 1979 and the growing voices of the anti-nuclear movement .
The leakage of radioactive gas into the atmosphere prompted the many anti-nuclear demonstrations that sprang up across  America in the following months .
Although the reactor was eventually cleaned up and decontaminated , the damage dealt to nuclear power was irreversible and caused its subsequent decline .
This is especially evident in the steady drop of the number of nuclear reactors built , a statistic that was rising prior to the accident .
With rising oil prices and growing concerns of global warming , countries are looking to nuclear power to solve the energy needs of tomorrow .
China , the factory of the world , consumes phenomenal amounts of energy to fuel its economic growth .
To partly offset this gigantic demand for energy , China has launched an ambitious program to produce 16% of its electricity from nuclear power by 2030 .
This endeavor to produce more nuclear power has stimulated the development of safer designs of nuclear reactors .
One example is the Pebble Bed reactor , an innovative design that is being actively researched in China .
Safety concerns characterize the basic concept of the Pebble Bed reactor with its passive safety design .
In this design , nuclear fuels are contained in spheres or 'pebbles' of graphite .
Hence the nuclear fuels are contained in a more stable environment .
When machinery failure occurs and reactor temperature increase to extremely high levels , the reactor does not undergo a meltdown or explode; instead , temperature just stays at the high level until the heat can be dissipated or cooled by coolant liquids .
In conclusion , nuclear technology development has always been driven by social factors .
World War 2 has given it momentum in its initial research , but it will be mankind's need for a renewable and environmentally friendly energy source that will drive nuclear technology's future developments .
the process of designing such technologiesCarbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas biningtrapsr-aided design , analysis , and manufacturing softputer simulations take significantly shorter time hence it is a preferred choice as it means that the product can be sold in the market in a shorter period of time .
equipmenttrappedThrough the five designing steps , a process can be designed to meet the need to decrease carbon dioxide level .
givesofwhich polluteEngineers design products or systems that meet human needs .
One current human need that should be given priority is the search for reneing to a conclusion .
Lastly , the engineers will put their solution to test and ensure that the solution is able to solve the problem .
As such , engineers made use wind turbines and water hydraulic generhasrs to harness the wind and wahas energy respectively .

With the increase in human population , the human race has come to a point es the most crucial part of an engineering design process .
This determines how accurate the engineer might have numberis work and also if he looked at nature as a considerable factor during his designing process .
The testing stage is usually either the most rewarding or heart- breaking stage of a design process .
Even though the solution seems perfect according to calculations , there are "nature factors" that we cannot control which still affect any process we carry under the sun .
It is likely that this genetically modified plant was give three hundred percent yield is actually not surviving until harvest .
If that is the case , what the engineer would do is analyze the problem at hand and point out exactly which part of the solution needs to be modified .
Another aspect of great engineers is their ability to optimize processes .
This includes less useless waste , more recyclable waste material and high productivity .
So any engineering process can be continuously modified into a faster , better and greener one .
It the need of feeding millions of starving peopletory that every engineering design process is naturally a cyclic process .

Therefore , this is one of the major factors that mercializing the finalize products .
In this final stage , it is all about hopany is selling .
Therefore , the innovated products are unable to meet the sumers .
Another example is the marketing department has set the price of the innovated product too high; therefore , they fail to obtain the sales target for the selling the innovated product .
So , this is another major factor that the innovators have to face .

Most of the private companies may also lack fng , equipment and materials for operation and production .
With regard to the second factor , another tponents .
Since most high quality and accurate equipment is very expensive , some private companies cis definedt afford it .
The poor equipment in private companies may lead to large uncertainty in design stage .
This could further lead to undesirable productions .
In addition , due to the economic shortage , private companies may not be able to hire people mercialization panies are the two main causes .
If the two factors from two types of enterprises can be improved , the whole design process for innovation in China can be financial mattersly .
Nuclear technology refers to technology that "involves the reaction of atomic nuclei"  .
It may appear as a high-tech term but in fact it has been put into use in various areas: radiometric dating , food irradiation , x-ray and chemotherapy in medicine and so on .
Yet , as a poplex international situation , it may be difficult for some countries to master nuclear technology and this characteristic is described as proliferation resistance  .
Besides gathering information , doing a wise selection among all the options is yet another must-do in engineering design process .
Selecting the best solution will minimize the energy consumption and cut down the cost for producing the product or sustaining the system .
When going through this process , various factors will be considered such as function , ergonomics and liability and so on  .
Therefore , the selected proposal can hopefully be expected to be environmentally friendly , less energy consuming and safe of using at the same time .
In a sentence , when dealing with energy crisis , doing analysis and selecting the best solution is of great importance .

In most people's opinion technology can oexplosivesoped or created via research .
Such as the invention of nee out in different ways .
As we all know Nobel is a very hardworking and brave man .
He nearly used all his time to work for new explosive and his younger brother dead in a failing experiment at the same time his brother's death had an unbalancing affection on his father .
His father dead right after his younger brother  .
But he never gave up and risked his life to go on his invention and his ideas came from his effort .
The story about how Schoenbein invented guncotton was quite an interesting story .
According to Yang , " when Schoenbein is doing experiments he overthrew a bottle of chemical solution , and the solution flowed on the table Schoenbein found nothing but his wife's apron to clean the table .
After he finished cleaning he thought that his wife will blame him after she saw what he had done .
So he wanted to use the stove to dry the apron .
When he walked near the stove the apron burned without any smoke and ashes left .
Then he felt very happy because he realized that he had found a new kind of explosive ."
Nobel can invent the explosive successfully because of his diligence and the attitude towards science which made him never give up .
Schoenbein came up with his idea accidentally and finally made an great invention for the word .

The last , the price of the raw materials fluctuate greatly .
The price of the ordinary materials are suitable and almost the same as other countries .
However , the special raw materials are very expensive , especially some accessories and some assistants .
As a result , we need to import the special materials from other countries .
Therefore , there are some problems about the raw materials of the plastic conduit that hamper the engineering design .

had hadfoundAnother consideration that separates the electric car from warfarin is that the electric car only has one usage whereas warfarin has other usages besides being used as a pesticide .
The electric car is a vehicle used for transportation and that is its sole purpose .
Warfarin , on the other hand , can be used as an anticoagulant .
It is prescribed to people with an increased tendency for thrombosis , the formation of blood clot inside the blood vessel .
Warfarin can also help to prevent formation of future blood clots .
causeIn conclusion , although technology can be created by means of doing research or by chance , there are still some similarities and differences between them .
Right from the first Industrial Revolution , human's daily life has been enriched by an exploding number  of inventions .
Currently human beings require more variety and a greater number of inventions .
Some of the inventions are developed from the conventional generated technology e from innovations e the impacts of unpredictable market during the process .
On the surface , conventionally generated demandingology and innovation created in a skunke out the technology faster .
Besides , researchers have to repeat the same experiment hundreds of times until success .
For example , Edison decided to invent electric light after Ferrari invented electric motor .
After concluding previous experiences , Edison tried about 1600 different materials as filament mon , that is researchers have to take all the uncertain consequences including a total failure during the process .
In other e . Sometimes the final product cannot reach e up ing up es to innovation , the conditions are quite different .
The researchers of the innovation may receive poor feedbacks in the prior market research , or someone even regard the researchers as idiots .
Thus normally the innovation has to be developed in a skunking essential in our daily life .
In recently years , engineering design for innovation has aroused consideration from the public in China .
As a most important aspect to contribute to the development of science and technology of the nation as mon nowadays .
Money for research is wasted on some vanity projects; cheating and plagiarism are carried out in order to win a reputation .
Paper , as the major measurement of one's achievement in academic circles , causes the situation to be even worse .
In order to issue more papers in some magazines , some engineers even use money to buy the opportunities of issuing their articles .
These problems in academic circle are impeding engineering design .
In recent years , Singapore has placed more and more emphasis on research and development , establishing her status as home to innovations .
Annually , millions in funds are being pumped into the R&D sector to encourage innovations to offer solutions to the pressing challenges Singapore faces .
Indeed , great success has been achieved , for instance Singapore's clean mercial interests and governmental policies .
In recent years , the core objectives of the country's research and development project hthe socio-political system he area of clean energy and petitive funding scheme to encourage innovations in this area .
Hopelled by several restrictions such as lack of resources and the inflexibility of the social system .
However , it does not mean engineering design in Singapore is not favorable .
In fact , great succesathas been achieved in some areas where it face less restrictions .
misplaced link wordIn the 21st century , everything develops at a very fast pace .
The needs of human beings have increased .
In order to meet  people's needs ,  engineers or scientists have started to conduct research research and design new things for the them .
They keep on trying and repeating repeating experiments experiments , and eventually succeed to generate new technology nees out during the trials .

developed via researchBefore a technology innovation is developed and patented , scientists have to go through a tedious research process most of the time .
Homon factor of all technological developments is that they address existing social problems , in one way are nother .
such as global warmingHowever , there are still differences between an innovation that is developed via continuous research and one that is serendipitously discovered .
These discrepancies can be further categorized in terms of their purpose , procedure and effect .
The conventional innovation process requires the engineers to first identify a human need before the research officially begin .
This ensures that the research has a proper target .
Take the development of electric cars as an example , engineers recognized the increasing emphasis on eco friendliness , and therefore developed the vehicle without fuel powered engine to ease global warming .
On the other hand , a serendipitously discovered product is not the preset goal that the researchers want to achieve .
Its application is realized after the product has already been created .
Alexander Fleming did not expect to discover penicillin mould when he left the petri dish containing Staphylococcus plate culture open .
Therefore , an innovation involving continuous research and development differs from an accidental discovery as the former is a rational problem solving process while the latter is more of a lucky surprise .
Apart from the difference in purpose , the conrequires engineerstional innovation products and the one serendipitously discovered also unbegins different research and development procedures .
The conventional products usually go through careful planning stages , making the whole development process well prepared .
These innovations are usually backed by solid ta fuel-powered background , expertise and sufficient funds .
GM allocated $2 billion for designing , manufacturing and marketing of tthat researchers r electric car IMPACT , after which expert diffusion scholars helped in campaigning for the product throughout the United States .
Within one year , the first tier of cars was put into mass production .
On the contrary , when Fleming discovered penicillin mould , he then had to refer his discovery to Charles Thom , an American specialist for further research .
It took more than 10 years for penicillin to be eventually purified and applied to medical use .
Lastly , the immediate effectiveness of a conventional innovation may be more conspicuous than that of a fortuitous discovery .
The centralized research procedure gives engineers more careful thoughts in the development of a conventional innovation .
The technological product created is thus more sophiscated and addresses human need more directly .
On the other hand , accidental discovery may be too crude for actual application immediately .
After Fleming had discovered penicillin , a series of specialists , including himself , had to carry out tedious research trials to further improve penicillin to ensure stable reaction on human bodies .
In conclusion , technological products developed via research do differ from those serendipitous discoveries in terms of their purposes , research procedures and immediate effects .
Despite of this fact , these products all serve to solve existing problems .
Yet technological innovation is not like a lottery game .
Instead , it should be a conscientious and exact pursuit of solutions .
Although there are occasional lucky winners , engineers should still put in every endeavour in all research processes .

Therefore , no matter whether the creation is based on research or luck , as long as it benefits us in one way or the other , it is a great invention .

Some factors such as the demand of lead user , economic factors , and environmental concern actually play important roles in shaping refrigerator into its shape today .

Furthermore , panies in terms of capital and avenues as well as confidence and morale of the products they sold .
Without the hunger of the unlimited needs in consumers today , technology will not be moving in such a fast pace and may be hampered by the lack of innovation from a lower demand in researchers and engineers .
Ultimately , while there are various factors that will influence the technological innovation today , we must constantly portend ourselves to follow the moral and ethical guidelines .
Otherwise , we are the ones who will the impact of unbridled curiosity .
Therefore , it will be up to mankind to take the crusade for a new safe world with the progress of technology in the near future .
The process of engineering and designing a nepared pany ."
Thus , if there is only a small local market to sell the product , a lot of extra effort will have to be placed to ensure that the final product sells .
The engineering design process will be further delayed because of this extra effort required .
The final effect of having a small population in Singapore is the lack of volunteers willing to try out new innovations .
This is further pointed out in the case of the Haptic Chair  developed by Suranga Nanayakkara , a PhD student from National University of Singapore .
Mr Nanayakleads had to bring the Haptic Chair back to Sri Lanka for testing because he could not get access to enough deaf children in Singapore .
The lack of testers in Singapore will hamper the fifth step of the engineering design process stated by Khandani , which is the testing and implementation of the solution .
The second problem that affects the process is the education system in Singapore .
The system is successfulexpertiseing the masses and is highly regarded by many other countries .
It emphasis mainly on academic performances and students are graded based on their exams .
As a result , there is usually lack of creativity in the students produced through this system .
The impact of having a lack of creativity during the engineering design process is severe as the process requires the generation of multiple solutions .
A workforce that is educated in Singapore will probably suffer as they are not used to answering design questions while they are studying .
Therefore , the process will most likely be hampered due to the lack of creativity in our workforce .
In conclusion , the Singapore government should continue their efforts to bring in more foreign talents and improve the current education system .
Companies should try and promote their local products to other markets and Singaporeans should be morthe National University of Singaporeons .
All this will lead to Singapore having a greater success in creating new innovations .
In order to handle the energy crisis , the research and development of hydrogen energy is an important section .
Hoe permeation problem and pass cycling tests .
On the other hand , for solid-state hydrogen storage , it requires materials that can absorb hydrogen quickly and massively .
Furthermore , there are also certain requirements for their reaction .
Overall , these tpressed hydrogen storage , many numerical modeling has been done through computational fluid dynamics tools .
It helps to better under the safety implications of potential accident situations .
And the experiment results came out as well .
For the cycling tests , the filling time is less than 3 minutes and the maximum pressure is 350 bar  .
For the permeation tests , tanks are filled up to 700 bar and the temperatures of ambient and tanks can be controlled up to at least 85c .
For the solid-state hydrogen storage , many testing and performance assessment of potential hydrogen storage materials have been done in laboratory .
Big progress has been made in this field , some new materials have been found and more waiting to be found .
Certain laboratory in European also offers services for research centers and university groups , so as to training and aspiring young .
Besides the exciting news about hydrogen storage technology , we still need to pay attention to its dangerous .
It can be hazardous if hydrogen leaks , and even cause disaster if hydrogen burnt and explode .
To sum up , the researcdesignsdsolveshydrogen will meet human's need and make great contribution for humanprocessesing forward; and the engineering design progress plays important part in it .
Technology has played a significant role in moulding our lives .
As long as ing up mon block , if the solar panels are fixed on the top of the buildings , e is mainly from the oil industry .
If households all over the world started converting to green technology , there will be a decrease in demand for fuel and as a result a decrease in their countries economy .
This is a case where a country is willing to put aside government priorities for the greater issue on hand , by supporting the use of green technology .
?Let us now take a look at the military demands which plays a part in shaping this technological innovation as well .
Tanks are built with the intent to destroy and provide artillery support during a war .
One way to reduce fuel consumption is to modify tanks such that they all have built-in solar panels , as long as the war is fought in the day , then it should be fine; realistic ?
It is because of the military demands that require tanks to be available at all times , and that it is able to withstand mild firepower , which is why any additional cost required for the solar panels will be put to better use by iconsistg the tank solidity .
this will affect the country's economyIn a bid to counter the issue of global warming , solutions that are socially determined such asincorrect in-text citationcreated .
Yet the use of it has been restricted by economic factors , military demands as well as government regulations .
Should the day arrive when innovations can be clear of such restriction , only then will the full benefits of it be felt .

An attractive loan and insurance scheme is substantial as it will allow potential customers to buy an electric car , which can have a hefty price tag .
These examples clearly show the significance of the benefits that cooperation between related industries can have on an emerging technology like the electric car .
Ultimately , it is clearly sseemto us that there are many factors that can deduce the rate of development of the electric car .
It is thus important for innovators to gain their government's support , get socially accepted and collaborate well with different industries .
In order for electric cars to substitute the current petrol cars , much more have to be done in the mentioned three aspects .
If these factors are not fulfilled , electric cars would still probably ends up as a failed dream .

According to the article "The History of Electric Vehicles" , Robert Anderson of Scotland invented the first crude electric carriage betpanies and some oil companies promised on limited range of electric cars .

The earth is experiencing water deficit .
Unlike burning forests or volcanic eruptions , the falling of water tables throughout scores of countries cannot be readily photographed , it is largely invisible .
However , in recent years , this has been observed by an increasing number of droughts , dried-out wells , and unavoidably , a change in climate pattern across the globe .
We are now consuming water that belongs to the future generations .
The high demand for , and the misuse of water are increasing .
Man has since been working , vastly through engineering efforts , to manage water resources .
According to Khandani  , engineering is the creative process of turning abstract ideas into physical representations  .
In the last few years , engineers had indeed innovatively manhaved and minimized water deficit in many countries by conveying solution ideas into engineering designed products and systems .
Water treatment has largely been classified being engineering process which turns used-water into clean , acceptable water for end use , and sometime even drinkable water .
Dirty water is usually collected through piping systems from lakes , drains and household , and transported to a treatment plant .
In the treatment plant , the dirty water is separated from solid particles by settling and filtration .
After which they will be treated and purified by various sub-processes such as reverse osmosis , distillation , chemical disinfection and some others .
All of these engineered processes will produce a cleaner effluent .
Further treatment can even turn dirty wastewater into drinkable water .
The 'Newater' treatment plant in Singapore is a global example of water treatment .
Water can be stored , treated and finally even transported .
Water transportation is made possible through engineered piping systems .
Large water pipes are constructed to constantly transport water from a storage dam to dried-up lands .
This allows for a good system of irrigation by providing transported water to the dried soil continuously .
This process and system assist in the growing of crops in dry areas especially during periods of inadequate rainfall .
With such engineering designs , deserts can be turned into green pastures with rich crops .
It is amazing how science and technology through man's engineering efforts have benefited the world .
We are now facing a crisis of water shortage which could lead to many water related problems .
Engineers in recent years have been working creatively and innovatively to properly treat and manage water .
With  advancements in technology , these are all made possible and there is even purified drinkable water treated from wastewater .
In certain countries , dried-out lands are even brought alive through water irrigation , where water is stored up somewhere and constantly transported through pipes to these lands .
Engineering products and system designs are not simply a design for aesthetical purposes , but also technologically meet some of the greatest human needs , water deficit .

This is made possible due to the innovations engineers have produced to improve on the lives of mankind .
What is the engineering designrocess that produced so many useful innovations like ?
According to khandani , S . , engineering design consists of five steps: definingKhandani (2005)blem , gathering information , brainstorming for solutions , selecting the best solution and finally the implementation of the solution .
These are the general steps to the formulation of an innovation .
This process requires certain skills from the engineer , such as creativity , ability to learn from failure .
In singapore , the local societthe abilityducation system produces prSingaporelems that hinder the usage of the engineering design process .
The first problem e of major examinations such as GCE 'O' and 'A' levels .
These exams do not concentrate on the learning process .
Instead , it focuses on the anspetitive and fast paced , hence parents believe that their children must possess outstanding paper qualifications to survive .
As a result , they eLroll their children in tuition classes to enhance their academic performance , depriving them of the chance to develop their critical skills .
Moreover , majority of the locals are apathetic to their surroundings .
Everyone minds their own business , and do not bother themselves with whalearnns around them , unless it concerns them .
areIn the current state of society  , people are not adept at analysing information and observing problems , and even if they did , they will deny its presence .
This behaviour will jeopardise the steps where the problem is defined and the selection of the best solution .
To be able to define a problem , the innovator must be observant enough to see the problem , and bothers to do something to improve it , hence creating an innovation .
The skills are vital to the two stages of the process , therefore society's mindset poses a problem to the design process .
In conclusion , for SinbypSe to have outstanding innovators , the roblems in the education system and the mindset of society must be addressed .
People must be more creative , able to think analytically and change their mindsets .
However , two problems are not the only problems that will impact the design processes negatively .
There are other problems that require attention .
With thesthe majorityms rectified , then Singapore will have more innovators , and hopefully more useful innovations to improve people's lives .
Global ing more anxious about .
One of the causes of this environmental degradation is from carbon emissions , especially , carbon emissions emitted from car exhausts .
Hence , the electric vehicle is an important technology as it is a possible alternative and replacement for future cars .
The electric vehicle panies petitive to the petroleum cars in prices .
Therefore , it can be seen that the government's involvement in promoting environmentally-friendly vehicles affected hoe of the electric vehicles in the market .
A technical limitation of the electric vehicle the range of travel it can offer .
An electric vehicle with a fully-charged battery is not able to travel as far as a petroleum vehicle with a fully-filled fuel tank .
Although families who needed a car as a mode of transport did not usually require traveling for long distances , there is a psychological perception of having their freedom being restricted .
Hence , they will prefer a petroleum car which has a potential in allowing them to travel farther .
Thus , the strong desire for freedom might have affected the popularity of the electric car .
In short , there are several factors that could have shaped the electric vehicles .
Economic and psychological factors might have dissuaded many from supporting them while the government plays a prominent role in encouraging the growth of the electric vehicle industry .
However , there is a close relationship between the social factors and the technical challenges that the electric vehicles face .
Hence , the recognition of electric vehicles by society could be affected by both social factors and challenges faced in the present technology of the electric vehicle .
As Khandani points out , innovations are designed to meet human needs .
Human needs and problems are the motivation of conceiving of nefortable and mentally irritable .
The
Technology innovation is significant to the e convenient .
According to Roster  , technology innovation development is a process begins mercialization diffusion and consequences  .
While , different countries have different mercial sector is not close enough .
As a result , professional people are not able to recognize the problem effectively .
Moreover , more efforts are need if they mercialize the product from their research .
So many issues that sever as anti-force are aroused during the innovation progress .

wantTo sum it up , the major differences between skunkworks and conventional technology is the ripples which both technologies produce and the secrecy in which they are required to observe .
These are features that make each technology unique in its own way .
However , both technologies also possess similarities like the stringent levels of accuracy and the lifespan of the products generated , which shows that features can be adopted by more than one form of technology as long as it is beneficial .
Having a home is one of the most fundamental human needs .
Be it a shelter or a big house , everyone has to have a place they can call home .

RFID is a kind of surveillance technology e a threat to our safety .
Thus , the usage of surveillance technologyattachede banned when it is used in an abusive way .
tagsIn conclusion  ,surveillance technology should concernedfor certain degree to ensure that privacy is protected and the security issue is solved also .
The Individual Requesting Genetic Testing Should Have the Final Say in plicated and variable  .
To some extent , it is irresponsible to reveal the results which are inaccurate or even false .
Moreover , once the results are forced to be revealed , consequences may be significant .
The fias it is t one is about emotional impacts .
Genetic testing creates tension within a family because it conveys people the information of getting ill also implies other family members the possibility of having the same defect genes .
People has sparkedl anxious , depressedd even guilty of revealing the results .
Gradually , people's life may be destroyed by psychological and mental problems .
The second consequence is about the genetic discrimination , especially in employment and insurance  .Insurance may not be provided to an individual with results showing the possibility of getting ill .
Besides , it is disadvantageous for getting a job with results showing that the individual is genetically inferior .
In that sense , revealing genetic results may put much more stress on people .
In conclusion , the results of genetic testing do have big impacts of people's life in terms of emotional impacts and genetic discrimination .
However , all the anxiety and pressure may be unnecessary because of the unreliability of such technology .
Therefore , the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results  , and this is also in agreement of protecting human rights .
aaGenetic testing is a kind of  test panies if the individual panies need to be cost effective too .
They should therefore have the rights to request for a medical record  .
isIn conclusion , the individual requesting genetic testing has the obligation to inform others of his condition  .

"The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned ."
Surveillance technology has indeed come a long es at the cost of intrusion into one's privacy .
Homitting felony .
It too plays a role in solving crimes , often acting as evidence to convict a suspect .
The development of biometrics surveillance has also been touted as the future of crime fighting  .
Criminal suspects can This technology easily identified through the matching of physical characteristics such as facial features and fingerprints to a biometric database .
It munication device of the staff .
This ensures that their movement and behaviour can be consistently monitored .
The tracking of patients is particularly useful in the protection of infant babies , alzcheimer's patients and others with special vulnerabilities  It alerts the staff should the patient encounter a mishap or wanders away .
The RFID wrist tags also codes for information regarding the patient .
Important data such as the appropriate medication , meal requirements can be easily retrieved , thereby facilitating the job of the nurses .
This method of monitoring minimizes any potential error and enhances efficiency .
It caters increased attention and care for the welfare of the patients .
In conclusion , the use of surveillance technology to track people should not be banned for it is crucial in crime fighting .
It also acts as a useful tool to ensure the patients in hospitals are well-taken care of .
RFID may revolutionize our society in future but at the very moment , it is still in its infant stage mendations .
However , be it for enhancement of sales or not , strangers should not be allowed to insurmountable private information as one's privacy is of paramount importance .
Lastly , it is not effective to introduce RFID to the goods market  .
A typical RFID tag cost approximately 20 cents while a scanner will cost about a $1000 .
When these devices are used on items that have prices ranging a few dollars , it makes one wonder whether one is paying for the item or for the delivery process .
Furthermore , the lack of standardization of RFID means that different RFID systems require different RFID devices  .
Store owners importing different goods would thus need different devices and this situation is unwanted .
In conclusion , infringes onf RFID should be restricted as the negative impacts associated with it are appalling .
Topic: The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing
Genetic testing is a DNA-based test which involves direct examination of the DNA molecule .
Such testing can be used for carrier screening or symptomatic/presymptomatic testing .
The practice of genetic testing has raised many controversies on ethical and social issues .
Some people suggest that the results of gene tests should be revealed .
However , the individual requesting such testing should have the final say in whether to disclose the results of the testing .
There are four reasons on why the decision to disclose the results must lie on the individual requesting it .
Firstly , all results of genetic testing have some margin of errors  .
Therefore , the results should be kept confidential to prevent misuse and other potential drawbacks .
Secondly , "one has the right to own property alone as well as in association with others , and no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property"  .
In this case , the property concerned is the privacy of the medical results , meaning that the individual's medical confidentiality is protected by Human Rights .
Thirdly , the revealing of the genetic testing results may create tension among a family .
Because genes are shared by members of the family , all of them have a fifty percent chance of carrying the same gene as one of them  .
In other words , the results can also reveal information about other family members .
Consequently , feeling of depression and guilt may arise among the family .
Lastly , a person with known genetic results may experience 'genetic discrimination' .
For example , an individual with genetic disorders may have difficulty in obtaining insurance and/or employment  .
Some may argue that at-risk relatives should be informed about their susceptibility to genetic diseases , so that they can take early precaution or seek appropriate treatment to the diseases .
However , most genetic diseases have no means of prevention or treatment  .
Hence , in most cases , disclosing the results of genetic testing to relatives will only bring psychological and mental stress upon them .
In conclusion , for the reason of privacy and technical unreliability as well as to avoid unwanted conditions such as 'genetic discrimination' , the choice to take a genetic testing is an individual's personal matter and the decision on whether to disclose the results or not depends solely on the individual .

For example , when the child is missing or kidnapped , the parents will be able to know the exact location of their kids .
This can also help the police in their investigative work .

Advances in genetic testing allow one to detect the presence of abnormal genes which could cause genetic disorders .
This has brought about many debates on whether the individual who undergoes genetic testing should have the final say in revealing the results .
While some proponents suggest that this involves the privacy of the individual who undergoes the genetic testing ,  the test results might also have adverse effects on those who are closely related to that person .
Hence , the individual undergoing the genetic testing should not have the final say in revealing the results .

He needs to inform his wife in order for them both make wise decisions if they were to start a family  .
They need to discuss on whether by not giving birtFor instance , theye disorder can berevented n to the next generation .
Alternatively , they can test and abortby them not having children affected with the genetic disease .
Hence , this affects not only the person with genetic dise but also the life partner .
In conclusion , the individual requesting for genetic test should not have the final say in disclosing his test result as it affects not only him alone but also his family and employer .
In recent years , the advancements of 'Radio Frequency Identification'  have led to its increased use in many major organisations .
One of the uses of RFID has been to track people .

Genetic testing is used to examine the genes of a patient or a latent patient , in order to find out the causes of some diseases .
It is noe a source of dispute in marriage .
For example , if a man's genetic testing results indicated some pathogenic genes but he got married with a woman without telling her about these results , the woman might feel that she  been cheated after she knew the truth because she did not want to married to a man with gene deficiency .

.earlywill missfamily membersfamily membersyIn conclusion , the individual should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of genetic testing .
It is important for individuals to share the results with their families in order to avoid diseases and benefit the whole family in the future .
There are two main arguments to support my stand .
Firstly , a couple who is planning to get married and one of them or a close relative  has an inherited disease , is advised to take up genetic testing .
The result of such a genetic test affects not only an individual but also affects his family and his fiance .
Both sides of family members should have the right to know the result and to be able to take preventive and treatment measures .
Furthermore , if the couple is planning to give birth but one of them has a positive result from such testing , they can discuss with their close family members whether to have a baby or not .
Thus , it is not right for the individual taking such a test to keep the result as a secret .
Furthermore , in my opinion , employers have the right to know such a result to ensure that their prospective or current employees are not placed in environments that might be hazardous to them and also can react immediately if something happens  .
If the individual has the final say to decide whether to revealthe result , it is unfair for his closed family and also people who are related o him if the individual decide to keep the result to him .
Others decides that it is unfair for the individual as the result is a kind of confidential information .
However , by not disclosing of such result , the consequences are seris .
Thea resultof giving birth to inherit genetic disease child is high anda child with an inherited genetic disease by exposing himseendangersrk environment that may be hazardous toa work health .
In conclusion , the individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in whether or not to reveal the results of such testing for his own sake , that of  and also his employer .
A genetic test is defined as an assessment of a person's genes to determine the probablitity of inheriting abnormalities or diseases  which he may pass down to future generations .
Thus , many will say the results must also be made known to his relatives even without his consent .
However , one should has the right to decide for himself whether he should reveal his results to a third party e .g .
relatives or corporations .
It is obvious that everyone have the right to ensure his or her privacy , as these are what make us different from animals .
Thus , as fellow Homo Sapiens , each  has the right to decide for himself .
Proponents may argue that  doctors should also release  genetic testing results to  relatives as these may also involve them .
However , it would be ridiculous for relatives  to know that they might also face this particular genetic disease in the future from the individual's results since everyone has a unique genome unless they are twins .
And also even if two individuals are somehow blood related , the probability of them inheriting the same particular genetic disorder is different .
When one is denied of the right to his or her own privacy , the consequences are definitely undesirable .
Some of the implications may be in the case of an insurance where some are  overcharged according to the results .
For instance , "during the early 1970s , a number of African Americans who were known to be carriers for the mutation associated with sickle-cell anemia were denied insurance coverage or charged higher premiums" " , this clearly .
Thishat had hshowsned when the privacy of the results are not ensuredishis situation could have been avoided if the individual could decide for himself , as he will be able towouldght the pro and cn betpros sincconst concerns his later part of l
In conclusion , there could be some laws passed down to settle all these ethical issues .
Ultimately , it still does not solve the root of these problems and  unforeseen situations in the future .
Therefore , rights should be given to the individual to decide for himself , as the decisions made will be impactful and irreversible  .
The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned .
The development and advances in surveillance technology such as Radio Frequency Identification  have made it possible to track anyone , anything , any placesplaceime .
This has brought about many debates on the ethics , human rights , privacy and even health concerns surrounding the use of RFID .
Although some argue that the use of RFID to track people brings benefits , it posts uexposes privacy to criminals , panies have implanted R microchips in their staffs to track their locations and thermation .
Hoas , or malignant tumors , after being implanted with microchips  .
Although humans are different from lab mice , there is a risk that what happened on the mice might happen on humans as well .
Furthermore , ifthe microchips react with a strong electrical or magnetic field , the implant could be destroyed and cause serious burns .
In conclusion , RFID should not be used to track people as it not only posts great risks to one's privacy and health but also violates ethics and human rights .
The use of RFID to track people should be banned by law and governments
Genetic testing has enabled people to test for certain genetic diseases , especially those e a topic for debate .
Making knopanies might increase the premiums of customers who are at risk for a certain disorder or even cancel their policy .
This discrimination would be very unfair to the individuals involved  .
Therefore , these individuals should always have the final say .
While it may be difficult even for the individual to accept the results of the test , sharing the news with their relatives and friends may be the larger concern .
While some may feel that it is the moral obligation of these individual to inform his immediate family members of pnot toe results of inheritable diseases such as cancer or HD , since they too may inherit the disease , I feel that there is no need for such an action as the result is after all private and confidential .
Also , certain genetic test such as the test for disorders of sexual development is a very private matter .
If an individual is to be tested pohealth for this disorder , such that she has the genotype for males but has phenotype for females , she might be ostracised and suffer self-esteem problems  .
If these individuals have the final say on whether to share the result , they would be less stressed as they do not have to be concerned with the views of others whom they do not want to share the result with .
This would give them more time to adjust to their personal emotion .

Should the individual requesting genetic testing have the final say in monly known that if a person has genetic disease , there is a chance that his or her relatives would have the same disease too .
If the genetic testing is revealed to the relatives and they end up having the same disease , they could be saved by preventing the disease to develop further more .
Another thing is people's life is obviously more important than privacy , especially if it's your loved ones .
Therefore it is encouraged to reveal the result of genetic testing , especially to your relatives .

Topic: "The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in munity"  is the privacy of genetic information .
Generally , the consensus for this problem is that genetic information should not be disclosed against people's privacy .
The choice to undergo genetic tes individual is personal , hopany may reject a customer , petition , they petition and this information then would be all public .
All these are called genetic discrimination .

The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say on whether to reveal the results of such testing .
With current technological advancements in genetics , there are many genetic tests available for the public , from testing for inheritance diseases to terminal illnesses .
I believe that an individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
The individual should be given the choice , as the emotional hurt from the media release of these ividual .
However , professional assistance should be available for the individual to seek advice .
Firstly , the emotional hurt from the world wide release of the individual's genetic information be .
Given the outreach of the mass media , reports of genetic disorder of an individual could be known to the world in minutes .
This will cause humiliation , especially when he/she is a professional , like an athlete .
However , many of these genetic disorders are unidentifieduntiland incurable .
The Olympics have tested their female athletes over five games and found 27 out of 11373 women tested positive for hermaphrodite  .
Secondly , the unintentional use of the genetic information can be disadvantageous to the individual and undermine the individual's ability , career , social interactions and economical choices .
In the interest of the corporation , people who are tested positive for terminal illness will not be provided health insurance or the career advancement .
Knowing one's death is approaching , the individual could make inappropriate social choices that can harm him/her and others . 
However , if the individual is unable to make the appropriate choice of the usage of the genetic results , a professional doctor should step in to provide relevant advice , while maintain patient-doctor confidentiality .
The individual may refused to release the genetic test's result , when it could provide treatment or prevent the spread of the illness within the family , in the fear of discrimination and humiliation . 
With the disastrous outing from the media release of genetic information and the use of genetic information against the individual , I believe that the individual requesting the genetic testing should have the final say in the release of the results .
But , if the choice cannot be made by the individual , a professional should provide appropriate release and use of the results .

"The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned ."
Firstly , the use of RFID to identify patients enhances productivity in the healthcare system  .
The use of RFID can minimize the long registration time for patients so that they are able to seek treatment in the shortest possible time .
When a patient goes to the hospital , his medical records mit a crime .
This gives the public a sense of security and hence , the use of RFID monitor ex-offenders is beneficial to waiting timesociety .
In conclusion , with these benefits that RFID have brought to people , it is undeniable that using RFID to track people will only improve the current situation and hence , it should not be banned .
Technological advances have brought along pros and cons ever since it entered our daily lives .
One of the many technologies innovated is the surveillance technology , mainly RFID  .
'Tracking' , in this context , is defined as both monitoring and identifying the location , behavior , activities and changing information such as medical information .
Admittedly , personal privacy mon objective betmitting crimes again , but more importantly , alloponents of our healthcare system .
Firstly , it cuts down on the waiting time to be attended to .
A scan on the tags allows healthcare personnel to instantly identify the medical information of patients .
Secondly , wasted time on retrieving essential information of patients during emergency could be put into treating the patients  .
Crucial moments could determine life and death .
Therefore , the RFID technology can better our healthcare system's efficiency .
Expediting the cracking of criminal cases is another point to why surveillance technology should not be banned .
Tracking locations could never be more important in cases such as kidnapping  .
Crimes like this should be attended to in the shortest possible time as it may result in injuries or even death of victims .
Furthermore , it could lower the crime rate , thus benefiting all people .
Hence , surveillance teFurthermorean assist in cracking criminal cases .
improvean emergencytime savedIn all , surveillance technology benefits us greatly in several aspects and thus should not be banned .
"The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned ."
Surveillance technology in the form of Radio-Frequency Identification  has brought about many improvements in the efficiency and procedure of our systems .
RFID is an electronic method of exchanging data over radio frequency waves .
My article will focus on the uses and advantages of RFID to track people .
Tracking is defined to be asing the whereabouts of a person and the identification of personal information .
I strongly believe that the proper handling of such technology will bring countless advantages and thus , the use of RFID to track people should not be banned .
The use of RFID to track criminals will improve the safety and security within a prison and ultimately , improve the overall national security .
Tracking criminals will allow the prison security to know the exact location of every inmate .
This will minimise the risk of violence and prisoners escaping .
This is  supported by statistics done by correctional institutions which show that cases of violence decreased by 65 percent when the RFID system was introduced  .
Even when such events occur , the investigation and the recapturing of those involved would be more easily dealt with the use of RFID .
Incorporating the use of RFID in the healthcare industry will improve the efficiency and current practice of the sector .
The storage of key medical records and information in a radio-transmitting chip will cut down time spent on rregistration , thus , allowing patients to receive prompt treatment .
In times of emergency  key information such as blood type and allergy could be retrieved in an instant by scanning the chip , and the most appropriate treatment can be decided in the shortest possible time .
This can prove to be vital in saving a person's life .
Lastly , the use of RFID to locate the whereabouts of children can help to reduce incidents of human trafficking .
In less developed countries like Cambodia , there is a large volume of children being trafficked and forced into labour and prostitution .
With the use of RFID to locate a victim , it will allow the authorities to capture the people behind such activities and provide a solution to the problem of human trafficking .
In conclusion , the benefits that RFID brings are immeasurable and thus , the use of it to track people should not be banned .

With the advancement  in science and technology , potential diseases become predictable nowadays .
For instance , a ten year-old child could undergo  genetic testing and predict the risk of getting Huntingdon's disease in middle age .
This achievement , however , raises a controversy of whether an individual who requests genetic testing should have the final say to reveal or not reveal the results of such testing .
Since the disclosure might bring negative effects to the individual's family and induce discrimination in employment as well as the purchase of insurance , I would like to agree with the statement of having the right to decide the revealing of genetic test result .
stressWhen an individual is tested positive for hereditary disease , disclosure of the result might impact his family negatively .
Family tension would be created if the revealing of the result happens at inappropriate moment .
Agatha M . Gallo and her colleagues  note that the decision of disclosing genetic testing result should be made by considering some major life events such as graduation and marriage  .
This is obvious and could be imagined that when the individual dcloses the information to his brother who is doing preparation for the A-level final examination , for example , the latter would be overwhelmed with stresses whereby affecting his performance during the examination .
In a nut shell , disclosure of an individual's genetic testing information might incur woes in his life .
Everybody should be considerate and let the individual to decide whether he is willing to reveal the test result .
He should have the final say .
Technological advancements in the medical field today have offered us a variety of genetic tests .
Although this technology is beneficial to mankind , there is an ongoing controversy pertaining to the question on panies are increasingly biased against people prehensively if they munication of hereditary argue and ovarian cancer genetic information .

Topic: The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such thing .
Nowadays , with advanced medical technology , people can apply genetic testing to identify changes in chromosomes , genes , or proteins .
This kind of technique provides convincing results of the gene information that the individual carries .
While as it is more and more widely used in medical test , how to deal with the results appropriately brings fierce debates on ethic and other issues .
Some claim that the results of genetic testing belong to the privacy of the person , therefo to reveal them should depend on the individual himself .
However , if the final decision just depends on the individual , it will not only curb the genetic research development but also delay the precaution of potential risk that some genes convey .
Thus , the individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the resulon of such thing .
In conclusion , the final say on whether to reveal the results of genetic testing should not depend on the individual as it not only has negative effects on genetic research development but also delays the precaution of potential health risk .
Thus , the individual should not act as judges to decide whether to reveal the results of genetic testing .
Surveillance is the systematic supervision or monitoring of the movement or information of an individual or a population .

One basic theory is using an electronic handshake spectrum to prevent the wrong procedures from happening .
Thirdly , it provides us a lot of convenience because as a result of the widespread of this technology , some old and needy patients can be cared and thus under safe condition anywhere .
By planting this device into their body , we can detect where they are in case some urgent diseases break out .

An illustration is a shopping mall , Wal-Mart , panies' privacy if confidential information were obtained .
Nevertheless , this concerwereay be overrated as Sriviastava  claimed that devices such as 'tag killings' are available to safeguard the information stored in the RFID tags .
Hence , the use of surveillance technology should not be banned .
Secondly , medical professionals assert that the use of surveillance technology aids in improvements in medical care .
Patients' health could be monitored and checked regularly with the use of RFID tags .
With this , the medical reports of patients can be shared and obtained easily by hospitals which will facilitate the diagnosis and prescription of drugs for the patients .
In addition , abduction of babies are minimised with increased security . 
In all , the use of surveillance technology should not be banned as it facilitates tracking of information and medical care .
As technology progresses , one may expect more surveillance devices to be developed in the near future .
The usage of surveillance technology such as RFID  on people or products has been a hot topic debated by both supporters and critics .
RFID tags has been introduced to the general public , but remains theoretical until the 11th September ,2001 attack .
The idea came es disfigured or unrecognizable in an accident .
Thus , the RFID technology starts to materialize and propagates in public motions pertaining to privacy and ethical issues aroused from the usage of such technology .
Albeit the risk of privacy invasion , RFID tags are potential devices which do benefits a lot to humans if executed under strict regulations .
First and foremost , with the RFID surveillance technology , personal safety in public places can be enhanced .
By having RFID attached to a person , especially children , their whereabouts can be constantly watched by their parents and increases the safeguarding of their children .
However , there are issues concerning the dependence of technology instead of parents giving full attention towards their children by their own effort , and thus decreasing their sense of respostarted ity as a caretaker .
propagateFID tags , their ccausedn can remain safe and sound by lowering the case of braisedjured or luses the devices can detect straightaway if such situations happen .
Therefore , RFID tags are efficaciobenefiteitoring the situation of children .
Surveillance is no longer unfamiliar in the era of technology-based society .
Surveillance , according to Bogonikolos  , is the systematic investigation or monitoring of behaviour or intercourse of one person or a group .
It is professionally used by the executive authorities and the governments , especially the Ministry of Defence .
Nonetheless , the generalization of certain simple surveillance technologies causes their existence to be es mores05/hors292 .pdf
Rapidly rising availability of surveillance technology have made it possible to yield information about the locations of people .
This has raised issues concerning the collection , use and disclosure of personal data .
Nonetheless , the use of surveillance technology adds convenience and offers opportunities for improvement in our daily lives , from personal safety to health .
Due to the potential technological benefits mitting a crime as they know they might be caught by the surveillance equipment  .
Secondly , surveillance technology can be used in healthcare and independent living for safeguarding purposes .
Besides allowing working adults to check on children and single-living elderly , this wireless interconnectivity technology are deployed in hospital to prevent abduction , enable health care professionals to get hold of patients' medical history , track individuals' whereabouts and send warning signals when patient collapses  .
Hence , such use of surveillance technology should not be prohibited .
Although the use of surveillance technology may lead to undesirable implications , they are highly unlikely to happen .
Some opponents of surveillance technology have argued that its use would invade their privacy and the information might also be distributed to unauthorised parties without consent (Kanellos , 2004: page no ?
)technical countermeasures , policies and regulatory initiatives had been introduced to minimise and possibly prevent these adverse effects  .
Hence , the use of surveillance technology to track people would still be effective and beneficial in our society , as long as the appropriate approaches are applied .
In conclusion , the use of surveillance technology would be constructive to many aspects of our daily life as the benefits far outweigh the societal concerns .
As a result , the use of surveillance technology to track people should not be banned . 
The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned
Surveillance technology can also be used in the medical fields .
Presbyterian Hospital in Charlotte , North Carolina came out with a RFID infant protection system where a RFID chips was tagged onto the infant .
The security s the infant was being illegally removed from the nursery .
This system successfully recovered a kidnapped infant by using RFID signal on the tagged baby to track its location .
GPS chip was also placed on Alzheimer's patient shoes to track their whereabouts .
Patient with this disease can be easily disoriented , hence , causing them to lose their way .
The use of surveillance technology can help the patient's family members to locate them and bring them home safely .
him/ herhim/ herA patientAlthough the use of surveillance technology will raised ethical concerns , to obtain important information that might save thousands of lives , there is no choice but to do it .
By tracking a suspect whereabouts or eavesdropping his or hers conversation , we might be invading his or hers privacy , however , if we can prevent another September 11 incident from re- occurring , I believe everyone would agree to it .

Genetic testing is the examination of the fundamental human genetic information , so as to assess an individual's risk of contracting diseases .
Although this advance in technology proves to be a significant breakthrough in the medical field , social problems in the form of genetic discrimination could be the likely consequences .
Thus , individuals undergoing genetic testing should have the final say in panies .
From the employers' point of viepanies .
Insurance companies function by collecting premiums from many separate individuals and paying large amounts to only some of the insured .
The rest of the sum collected pany's profits .
Hence , if genetic testing results are available to the insurers , they would likely exploit it by increasing the premiums to be paid by the individuals tested positive to diseases , or declining them the policies .
This form of discrimination does exist , and laws have been imposed to alleviate this problem .
For example , the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act was introduced to stop the misuse of genetic testing results by insurers  .
Thus , to more effectively alleviate discrimination from insurers , individuals should have the final say .
treatmentseekleaveTo conclude , genetic discrimination can be alleviated if the individuals have the final say in whether to reveal their genetic results .
Technological advances have eased the carrying out of surveillance activities .

While surveillance has been a part of society since the mercial data mining to serve behavioural advertising has raised concerns puter experts due to potential of abuse being present .
While RFID has proven itself as a bating terrorism on an international scale , it has also opened a panies have losmassiveningful control  over the use of their personal data which is often shared with third parties for financial gain oblivious to the victim's lack of consent .
Surveillance technology even when well intespurred has been proven to have too many potential pitfalls to be ignored .
The rise in the infringement of individual privacy by malicious people and oppressive government shows no sign of slowing down due to continual evolution in both legitimate technology and the resourcefulness of criminals to exploit it .
In conclusion , the relative gains in accessibility and efficiency does not give carte blanche for private organisations or governmental agencies to push forth dubious surveillance technology regardless of how well intentioned it may be .
The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in panies use the results of genetic tests to influence the employment prospects of an individual .
For example in 2005 , a Chicago Bulls basketball player named Eddy Curry was sold to the New York Knicks because he refused to take a genetic test to check if he was predisposed to a heart ailment  .
So what if the he had taken the test and was diagnosed with having a higher possibility of developing heart problem ?
He would probably be sold to another team even though he could be a good player .
This would be unfair for the individual .
Thus , to protect themselves from genetic discrimination , individuals should maintain their rights in having the final say whether to reveal results of genetic testing .
Another reason for individuals to maintain their rights in revelation of genetic testing result is so as to allow individuals to enjoy the benefits that genetic testing can bring .
Because of the potential discrtheinations that individuals could face due to their results of genetic testing , many chose not to take the test .
Even with the improvement of the technologies related to genetic diseases , these individuals are denied of the opportunities to prevent , or even treat the genetic disease that could be present .
If the results of genetic testing are to be forcefully revealed , less people will be willing to even go for the test .
Hence , to allow individuals to have the chance to know more of the preventive measures or possible treatment , they should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of genetic testing .
the resultsIn conclusion , there are consequences the individuals have to consider whether to reveal tir result of genetic test .
If they are forced to reveal , they could be subjected to unfair treatment and be void of the benefits of genetic test .
Thus , individuals should maintain their right to decide whether they want to reveal the result of their genetic test .
