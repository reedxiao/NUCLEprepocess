However , is it the same when we keep in touch with someone virtually compared to when we meet them personally ?
I do think there is a difference  and I believe many of us will agree .
When we write or communicate virtually , we can hide our through feelings and may not become ourselves since we do not want the other party to judge us .
Other than that , sometimes the message of one party cannot be delivered properly to the other one since the communication is done through written language , and thus the 'tone' of the message sent and when it is received may be different .
Many people are very brave about telling people about their opinions online , but in real life , some of them can be very shy and not outspoken at all .
This will lead to  bad interpersonal skills as well as  problems of trust .
Nowadays , we cannot really trust new people whom we know from social media , since we will never know whether they are even 'real' .
Some people fake their identities on social media sites so that they can know more people or some may even cheat others .
In addition , the issue of privacy has become more popular nowadays , since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they were not willing to share in the first place .
Therefore , while social media sites  undoubtedly have benefits in our life , we should consider their drawbacks and  , thus , use them wisely so that we can gain more of their benefits and they disadvantages us in the smallest possible way .
It is a common scene that almost everyone on  public transport is watching at a phone or wearing a pair ear piece in this modern society  .
Not only one but many developed and developing countries have the same picture .
Some say that it is a necessary step in human revolution .
Social media sites like Twitter and Facebook are popular among people for connecting to others even from different countries .
It also brings many negative effects such as loss of face-to-face communication skills , which are important in their workplace .
This essay will discuss  the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life .
One of the significant advantages of using a popular social media site is that people can reach other easily , even without having had contact for a long time .
In this fast paced and competitive world , people may not be able to keep in touch with others .
With the help of social media sites , people are able to upload their new discoveries and funny scenes to them and they can be updated on the new information of their friends .
Personally , I  study  overseas , and my busy study life keeps me  from contacting my old friends .
Using a common social media site with my friends  helps me know what their statuses are nowadays .
And I am able to easily find a common topic when I contact them .
In Singapore , many Malaysians cross the sea to work here .
Many of them are busy in work and separated from their children .
One of the managers in my workplace has the same situation .
After my manager taught her mother how to use Facebook , she was able to upload video clips of her grandchild .
Therefore , my manager would not miss  moments of her daughter's growth .
Social media sites are also a very useful tool for people to start a new friendship or relationship .
People with the same preferences get connected or closer .
It is easier for people to approach the other person after knowing the information .
Students can exchange  experiences in their studies even if they are in different countries .
People are able to share  culture or pretty photos online , and others can spread the joy with them .
Thus , I believe that social media sites are a useful tool to help people known each other better .
In conclusion , the shadow always exists when there is light .
We should take the advantages of the creatures we create and try to avoid the negative effects .
Social media sites are supposed to be a very useful and convenient tool to  bring people  closer in this globalised world .
The use of social media has largely influenced our ways of communicating with one another .
Online friends have become real life friends and real life friends communicate with one another online .
Social media have changed our ways of exchanging information and conducting interpersonal relationships profoundly .
There are advantages and disadvantages to this change .
The broadcasting and viewing model is not good for forging relationships .
However , it is good for sharing information .
On social media , everyone is a broadcaster and a viewer .
With my social network account , I seldom read newspapers or go to news websites anymore , because I can easily read them from the status of my friends .
If I am interested in politics , I can just follow some politics newspapers or public figures .
I get news about sales , clothes and cosmetics from my friends .
If some of my friends has horrible taste in clothes and he/she posts them often , I can simply block him/her  .
Information gets circulated .
The most popular information gets circulated the most , so I  seldom miss it .
Social networks play a role in providing and also filtering information .
This saves a lot of time for me  reading newspapers and watching TV .
Personally , I feel more at ease on social media .
From the above two points of view , I think social media could forge more interest-based friendships .
With the help of social media , I become real life friends with those from online forums whom I share the same interest with .
I also discover some of my friends' interests which I find in common with myself , so that talking to one another is much more about life , study , friends , etc .
The communication does not focus on how we feel ,  but on whatever is interesting , or the content .
In this case , interpersonal skills are not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody , but to get the information that we are both interested in .
People that live in the modern world really cannot live without  social media sites like Twitter and Facebook .
Almost all students and young adults possess a Facebook or Twitter account .
It is true that social media make people  able to connect with one another more conveniently .
However , it seems that , especially for some  , sharing some parts of their lives such as videos and photos on the social media sites has become really necessary .
An extremely interesting and ironic phenomenon was discovered that a group of friends met and sat around one table , but none of them were really chatting with one another .
Instead , all of them were more interested in posting pictures of this "cheerful" meeting on their social media sites .
Therefore , there is a need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media .
Social media enable people from different parts of the world to communicate with one another .
People used to write letters and send postcards to keep in touch with ones living far away from them in the past .
It could take a few days or weeks for them to receive the messages .
Nowadays , what people need to do is just type in front of the computer in their own rooms .
And people on the other side will only need a second to receive the message .
Distance and time are no longer  problems , which is convenient , especially when instant chat is needed .
However , when people become more and more addicted to this convenience and fail to communicate with people who are close to them , their face-to-face interpersonal skills are lost .
Social media provide people with a way of talking and chatting which can never be considered as a way of communicating .
When one chats on those media sites , there is no eye connection , no emotion delivery and even the expressions are typed in by using some combinations of punctuation marks .
For more convenience , sentences are shortened to simply three or four words such as lol (which means laugh intensively) and "asap" (which means as soon as possible) .
Indeed , people go to great lengths to make their words as short as they can .
While , once they are communicating with people in their face , expressing themselves appropriately becomes a really big problem .
Social media also provide people with huge  information about people and things that interest them .
For example , on Twitter , it is exciting to follow people that you adore , like famous movie and series stars , businessmen and entrepreneurs .
It makes people feel extremely close to their admirers' lives and works .
Updated news people care about can be easily obtained when you refresh your social media sites on your smartphones and laptops , almost every time at any time .
However , after one has registered on those social media sites which are not reliable , all the information you have filled in will be a weapon against you in the future .
Furthermore , not everyone on the social media sites is honest .
The profile picture may not be of the person  that user says he or she really is .
The reason might just be that he or she just wants to "decorate" his or her face .
But there is a possibility that the person on the other side is deceiving you in order to obtain your information against you .
The fact that there is no pledge of authenticity risks people's information  that is shared on social media sites .
To sum up , social media have advantages and disadvantages in people's daily life .
They shorten the distance between people from all over the world and make instant communication possible .
And it becomes more convenient to obtain and update information by using social media .
On the contrary , social media make people lose their ability to communicate effectively in their real lives and make people risk exposing their privacy to those whose identity cannot be verified on the social media sites .
With the development of  technology , social media becomes a more and more significant role in the whole world .
Everyone in the world cannot stop using it every day to express their feelings or ideas and a lot of other things which helps their friends know their lives better .
However , this also raises  concerns about whether they bring us more benefits or a human disaster .
Although it helps to connect us with our friends wherever we are , at the same time , it reduces the chance for us to talk to our friends face to face , which may affect our interpersonal skills .
Thus , whether there are more advantages or disadvantages becomes a tough question for every human being .
Many people say they will support  social media since it really helps them to have a closer view of how their friends are going in other parts of the world .
This is especially relevant to people who are overseas .
To them , social media is the only resource they can approach to know everything happening in their home country and a way they can use to show their lives to their lovers as well .
What's more , these days , social media play an important role in spreading  information .
Nowadays , people can just easily put their  on their Facebook account and wait for the response from others who are from different parts of the world , which brings us a huge amount of convenience .
It is quite significant especially for  young teenagers , since they would rather go to these sites to see the news and know what is happening in this world than read the newspaper every day .
However , there are also a great amount of people who are against this technology .
They worry a lot about the bad effect on  teenagers , who are still developing  .
They point out that , actually , social media reduce the chance for us to talk to people around us face to face .
The more we care about Facebook , the less time we will have to spend with our friends .
Nowadays , it is quite common to see at some party , people  prefer looking at their phones and reading all the posts on Facebook if they feel bored .
It makes people worry because if all the teenagers continue using social media frequently , they will decrease their ability to talk to people about .
They will feel it becomes difficult for them to find any topics to communicate with other people .
Personally , I strongly agree that social media bring more disadvantages compared to the advantages they give us .
Although it is really useful when we need to use it to let other people know we really live a good life , it wastes  a lot of time as well .
Think in another way , if we put the time we spend on wandering on those sites , we might already finish a book or do other more meaningful things .
We should keep in mind that there are still ways for us to contact  our family or friends .
Everything is bad if we don't know how to use it wisely , no matter whether it is really good or not .
As a result , it is important for people to know that we need to be cautious about the time we spend on these social media .
As stated above , I strongly believe that if we can use social media wisely rather than abusing them , we will all live a better life .
Nowaadvantagesthe tdisadvantages becoming increasingly advanced , more and more social media sites are appearing in our daily life .
You can see people playing Facebook and Twitter through their smartphones or iPads on buses or on trains .
Some may say that the appearance of these modern media will reduce the chances for people to communicate face to face .
This essay will illustrate the pros and cons of using social media in modern society .
First of all , social media can make it more convenient for people to make friends and contact each other .
Years ago when these modern products weren't popular , the way for people to communicate or contact people far way were still restricted to making phone calls , sending emails or writing letters .
Some  take a long time and some are not efficient enough for people to get their response .
However , social media solve these problems well .
People can contact their friends on the internet and get their reply very fast .
The communication is also not limited to words .
People can express themselves through pictures or emotions .
People can also get to know their friends' state and mood by looking at their posts online .
Moreover , people can be aware of what is going on in social situations and see the comments online and share their opinions on these websites .
These social media make people's lives much more colorful and provide a lot of fun .
However , social media may do some harm to people's lives .
They will make people spend more time on chatting on the internet rather than communicating face to face , such that  interpersonal skills will be badly affected .
Some people spend a lot of time on them and forget their real life .
Actually , I have seen that some people are very funny and interesting when I am chatting with them online .
However , they behave quite boring when I talk to them in real life .
Teenagers are developing their interpersonal skills and social skills when they are growing up .
If they spend too much time on these social media , it may cause some problems with their mental development .
They may feel uncomfortable when they communicate with people face to face .
Some may share fewer and fewer time with their family and not know how to express themselves .
Moreover , some wrong values on the websites will affect teenagers and confuse them .
Some may even do something wrong .
In conclusion , the showing up of social media sites is a double-edged sword .
It can make our life simpler .
People can promote their friendships and relationships through these social media .
However , it can also make people forget to communicate with their family and friends in  real life and negatively affect  their interpersonal skills .
But overall , the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages .
So we need to make the best use of these social media and make them a fun way of adding some excitement when life is boring .
And try to bypass the shortcomings .
And remember to send greetings to our friends and family frequently .
Nowadays , with the advancement of technology , it is easy to communicate wherever you are .
The appearance of social media sites truly connects people closely .
People can know their friends' recent looks and interesting things happening to those people just by checking their Facebook or other social media sites .
We cannot deny that  social media sites truly make  old friends  not lose  information and  chances to communicate with you even if you are in a different country .
However , the social media sites truly reduce  face-to-face communication  , which truly affects interpersonal skills .
There are two advantages and two disadvantages of using the social media in  daily life .
Firstly ,  social media sites can closely connect people with their friends and parents .
By typing  words and showing  pictures , people can express  emotions that they are too shy to express face-to-face .
For example , on Mother's Day , people are too shy to say "I love you" to their mothers , but they can type it on their mother's Facebook page .
Then their mother will also know the emotion and feel warm .
On the other hand , when a teenager is studying in a foreign country , the internet is the only way that he can communicate with his parents and friends .
Therefore , the social media are truly good for people .
Secondly ,  social media sites can not only closely connect people with their friends .
People can also know much information about  celebrities on Twitter and Facebook  and get the  on them .
They can learn how these people succeed and they can also have the chance to talk with them and know these famous people's thoughts by using the social media .
On the other hand , with the help of social media , some homeless people or someone who needs  money to cure a disease can get  help from the world quickly , because once one person knows the information , he or she will share it with their "friends area" , then many people will know  and spread the information to  people who can give help .
On the other hand , there are also problems with the population of the social media .
Firstly , when people rely on  social media to communicate with their friends and parents , they will become accustomed to communicating by typing and not talking .
People even prefer talking to their friends and meeting their friends online and gradually reject face-to-face communication .
Therefore ,  social media truly limit  interpersonal skills such that people lose the chance and the ability to practice talking and  between them and their friends .
Secondly , without  true communication in  real life , people lose the ability to see the truth and false .
There are many people on  social media with beautiful images and good content on their pages , but in real life , he or she may  not have a job or may live poorly .
Teenagers may believe these people and easily be cheated and lose money , or even their safety .
Therefore ,  social media are not safe , which is bad for teenagers' future development .
All in all , the appearance of social media truly helps people a lot in many areas .
However , there exist some disadvantages which will affect people to some degree .
Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Social Media in Our Daily life and Society .
As for the advantages , there are two aspects: more convenient to contact others , easier to know about others .
One advantage is that it is more convenient to contact others by social media .
In the old days , if one wanted to tell some important news to someone who lives far away , one needed to write letters and that wastes time .
The long distance and time-consuming made spreading  messages very difficult at that time .
Therefore , people did not contact   faraway friends and relatives unless there was something important .
However , people can now contact  anyone all over the world who can use a computer at any time , and there is no time delay to messages .
The other advantage is that it is easier to know about others through social media .
If there were no social media , it would be difficult for people to know about a stranger .
They could collect information about that person by asking their friends , colleagues or family members .
And the information collected might not be intact and true .
Unlike today , with the help of social media , people can easily get the information they want just by searching online , and know about what that person does every day and at what time .
In  conclusion , there are both advantages and disadvantages of using social media in daily life .
People should enjoy the advantages of social media while being aware of the disadvantages  and try their best to avoid the disadvantages happening to them and their friends and family .
In an age of rapid technological advancement , a lot of medical breakthroughs are made possible .
Genetic testing is made possible and available for  .
It is able to detect  illnesses or diseases and even a child's parentage .
However , it will become a controversial issue as it becomes a dilemma for a carrier of a known genetic risk whether to inform his or her relatives .
If the knowledge of the genetic risk was to be shared with the family or relatives , there might have chances for them to have it in their blood which they may do the necessary precautions to prevent .
But , if the genetic disease is a terminal disease , most  relatives will be disheartened upon learning about it .
Therefore , some carriers will have the opinion of keep it  a secret .
This essay will discuss  whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives or not .
Some say that the genetic risk that is found in a person should be kept secret because it is considered as  personal information which should be kept confidential .
Most patients will be depressed after realising theircondition .
If someone has a genetic disease , after the test , they might not wish to inform their relatives as they might end up disheartening their extended family .
Some will wish to keep it to themselves and hope to ensure that they will not bring  any pessimism into their family .
Furthermore , some will wish not to become a burden to anyone , as seeking medical attention is relatively costly .
Hence , some see it as being considerate by keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease  confidential .
On the other hand , others may think that it would be considerate to tell the relatives , because the latter will have a higher tendency of getting the same genetic risk .
Hence , they will be able to seek help from medical specialists to find a cure or to do some measures to prevent the risk of getting the disease .
Nevertheless , it will depend on what kind of genetic disease ,  in the context of current medical technology .
For example , breast cancer is a genetic disease and it can be cured if it is being realised in the early stage .
Hence , with the knowledge of having a genetic risk , the relatives of someone with this genetic disease will do a medical check-up , which might save them by realising it at  earlier stage .
In conclusion , it would be considerate to inform relatives of the risk of getting the same genetic disease .
Although there might be a lot of challenges along the way in seeking medical attention , such as financial issues , everyone should be given the right  to know their family's inherited medical conditions .
However , some think that it might be better for those who are ignorant of it because they will continue leading a happy life .
In addition , some may think that even knowing about having a risk of a disease will just add to their misery as there is nothing that they can do about the condition .
All-in-all , it depends on the individual and also the nature of the disease , but he or she should be obligated to inform their relatives if there are possibilities of curing or preventing it .
Today  is considered to be the era of social media sites like Facebook and Twitter , which are attractively connecting people around the world .
However , some people worry that social networking can affect interpersonal skills as it reduces face-to-face human contact .
The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in  society are elaborated on as follows .
Nobody can deny social media's advantages in view of the benefit they provide in connecting people regardless of nationalities , races , cultures and languages .
Social media are a trending channel and a suitable means of communication .
Firstly , social media bring convenience to the world .
They have erased the boundaries of distance and time .
No more worries about the time it takes to deliver letters and packages .
Nowadays , thanks to  social media , with just one click , you can contact your family and friends wherever you want .
You can share photos , videos and every meaningful experience of your life .
More importantly , it is cheap and easy to use social media .
Secondly , a social media network opens the door of opportunities for people due to its great benefit ofconnecting people .
A lot of fresh graduates can find jobs thanks to Facebook and Twitter .
Young people can widen their relationships , meet new friends and learn wonderful things in many parts of the world .
In business  , social media are a good tool to develop and advertise products and services .
On the other hand , social media also have disadvantages which have created worries for  society recently and made it a controversial phenomenon .
More and more young people tend to live in the social media world most of the time and reduce face-to-face human contact , which can affect interpersonal skills and relationships in social life .
First and foremost , we should realize that the the social media world is not trustworthy and real .
Everyone can easily make up the personality and characteristics they want .
They can become anyone .
Though social media do create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication through face-to-face interaction .
There is a story of a girl who lived in social media world every night for eight years .
In the chat room , she created a close relationship with eight people .
She talked with them every night , trusted them and shared her life with them .
Then eventually , she discovered that those eight people became one as he was using eight different identities to chat with her all the time .
Furthermore , the convenience of social media is also its weakness .
A lot of people use their true information on social media sites , which can lead to crimes and deception .
People can use the information to deceive family and friends and banks to do bad things such as blackmail , ATM theft and so on .
Last but not least , social media do affect human interpersonal skills when people increase the time on social sites and reject chances to expose themselves to social daily life activities as well as interacting with people .
Recent research has shown that the more people spend time on social media sites , the less they become ambitious .
As a result , if the situation keeps go on  this unexpected trend , it will cause a bad effect on the younger generation .
Genectic testing is a personal decision , made with the knowledge that there is a possiblity that one could be a carrier or not .
Those who are born into a family with a history of genetic disease should be allowed to undergo genetic testing , even  if there is no risk at all .
Early pre-examination is healthy as it will cast away unwanted doubts and affect the psychological thoughts of those who are affected .
For a genetic risk carrier , there should be a choice given with regards to informing his/her relatives .
They should not be forced or obliged to do so , as it may negatively and drastically affect the emotions of the genetic risk carrier .
With regard to this choice  , there must be some rules to regulate and exercise personal freedom of decision making .
If the genetic risk carrier is a minor , then most likely the decision about informing the relatives should be made by the patient's parents or legal guardian .
Such patients are still emotionally volatile or they may be unaware of the consequences of the genetic disorder due to their young age .
Furthermore , the act of informing others without the consent of their parents or the patients themselves could harm the psychological state of the affected family .
Thus , much thought needs to be put into the immediate family , as it could cause a stir of unwanted events for the patient or the family members themselves .
Some family may feel hurt  with regards to their family pride or reputation on having the knowledge of a genetic disorder running in their family .
However , there is a  and a sense of responsibility to inform their relatives since it is a genetic disorder .
There might be a possibility that the genetic disorder could also affect their relatives and any other families within the same family tree .
The importance about informing relatives of a genetic disease is vital as it may help to raise awareness and prevention of the genetic disorder .
Also , this  information will help their relatives to make informed decisions and to similarly undergo genetic testing to find out about the outcome .
Thus , having the knowledge that the genetic disorder is benign would be beneficial to their emotional thoughts .
And if the results turn out to be otherwise , then the family can be prepared emotionally and psychologically for the future outcome and this will aid them in making upcoming decisions .
In addition , the genetic risk carrier would be showered with moral and emotional support from their relatives if it has been made known to them .
Having support from relatives is vital as they ensure the genetic risk carrier that he/she is not alone in facing this illness , and it will certainly provide a morale boost , as the whole family will share a common sentiment with regards to the future prospect of the genetic disorder , which could be inherited by anyone in the family .
Therefore , the decision to inform relatives of a genetic disorder will be dependent on the situation and background of the affected family , with the liberty of choice given to them in making the decision of informing others .
A person with a disorder , whether it be a mental or physical disorder , is always  by his or her family .
When things comes to genetic issues , it is not that simple anymore .
Genetic disorder  , but not all of the offspring show the relevant symptoms .
Sometimes a family with a risk of potential genetic disorder may not be able to detect the potential harm inside their bodies as none of their members reflect any observable  symptoms .
As a result ,  when one of the members happens to feel uncomfortable or unnormal , he or she should be aware of whether the disorder in his or her body is a genetic risk or not .
Afterwards , the carrier will face a serious ethical issue , which is whether to reveal the problem to his or her relatives or not .
If the disorder symptoms reflect by a child , the parent will be informed by the medics  , then the whole family will stay alert to their bodies' condition .
On contrary , if the carrier is an adult who has their own choice to choose whether to inform their relatives about the risk , that will be more complex .
One might think that if the carrier is a caring person who loves their family more than themself , there is no doubt that they will tell their family about the issue .
That is true and , of course , it is the obligation of a family member to protect and take care in the family .
Conversely , if a child of the family knows that he has the risk of becoming a genetic risk carrier , and the risk might as well be inherited by his child in the future , he will be in a dilemma his whole life .
And of course , he or she will think of not having any children after getting married , and the same thought goes to the cousins as well .
As a result , the family generation stops  the moment the adult carrier announces his issue .
In China , the older generation with a traditional cultural background will always think of having more children as well as grandchildren , to make the family liven up and stronger .
The reason behind this is that after WWII the population of China decreased dramatically and so the government encouraged the people to have more children .
During that period , if one of the family members reflects genetic disorder symptoms , he would fell in an ethical dilemma for sure .
The medical  technology during that time was not advanced enough to completely cure him .
He had to choose whether to protect his family or make his family more prosperous with a potential genetic risk .
And so , he would have chosen not to undergo genetic disorder testing and to let the truth be mined forever .
This kind of ethical issue cannot be judged by  others because they will not understand the position and duty of the carrier in the family .
In conclusion , people should think carefully about what the consequences are of telling the relatives about their genetic disorder  .
It is an obligation for a carrier to inform his relatives , but also an obligation for a family member to liven up the family .
Regardlessly if the disorder is rarely  fatal or it does not cause any inconvenience to the carrier , revealing the truth is always the right thing to do .
For every action there are always pros and cons .
I believe that some  carriers will choose not to reveal their disease to  family members , as they do not want to make their family members worry and feel uncomfortable or even to feel ostracized by them .
Furthermore , as it could incur spending  lots of money on the treatment , the carrier might not want to be a burden to their family .
I can understand the feelings of the carrier .
She or he does not want to be the source of unhappiness in the family .
However , we will never know whether these negative effects will happen when the carrier decides to tell his or her family about his or her condition .
In conclusion , personally , I feel that it is better for the carrier to inform their family members about the issue .
The carrier should be honest about his or her feelings  , and I find that it is the right of the family members to know what is going on in his or her life .
If anything wrong happens in the carrier's lifewithout their having informed the family members , it could make a huge regret in their life if they leave without them knowing about it .
On top of that , it is better to think about solutions to their problem with the family members ,  as there are more heads to think about it rather than thinking about it alone and struggling on their own .
In the end , I believe that  support ,whether mental or even monetary  , from their family could help the carrier to fight against the genetic disease .
There are lots of cancer patients who were given a second choice to live as  normal people because they had  strong mental support from their loved ones .
In my opinion , as long as we keep our mind healthy and strong , we can fight any disease , because they come to us when we are fragile and weak .
Some people might say that it is a form of prevention against giving birth to disabled lives and making them suffer in real life .
I personally think this is the right purpose of going through  genetic testing , so that a family who cannot afford to have a disabled child do not have to give birth to their child and make the entire family suffer .
However , I believe that the carrier has the right not to be obligated to tell anyone , but has a responsibility to take  action to prevent any ethical dilemma .
If the result turns out to be something that the carrier cannot accept , then it would have been better not to know the truth .
I believe that even the carrier has the right not to know the  facts .
After he or she realizesthat he or she is the carrier , the emotional damage would be hard to bear .
It could possibly cause a problem in a family  and cause more unhappiness in the family .
Overall , I believe that it entirely depends on the carrier whether to share the hard facts and face it with relatives , but he has no obligation to tell  .
In fact , I strongly think that the carrier should weigh both the positive and negative consequences of taking  genetic testing and take the appropriate action based on the results .
The depression that the carrier might get and the sense of guiltcould be more than expected and could be a burden  for the rest of their life .
On the other hand , without knowing about any genetic disorder and accepting the fact , the family will stay positive and work together to overcome the disability .
I think the family will stay mentally healthy as it is , without having emotional stress .
