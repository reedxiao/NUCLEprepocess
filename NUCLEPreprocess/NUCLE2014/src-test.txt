To ensure sustainable development without the compromise on environment , GFR has used nuclear power to provide energy .
Thus , it has greatly reduced the excessive production of carbon dioxide .
According to world nuclear association , "the cost of managing and disposing of nuclear power plant wastes is about 5% of the total cost of the electricity generated ."(2009) .
Thus , nuclear waste has not only occupied space , it costs even more to solve the problem .
In terms of it producing lesser waste , GFR has proved to be more outstanding than VHTR .

With the development of the post-modern society , more and more energy is required for its maintenance and growth .
The world seems to get relieved from the lack of energy source since the Generation IV reactors come out .
However , the newborn technology , Generation IV reactors needs to be improved before it can be applied to practical uses .
It is difficult to make a decision on whether there should be R&D funding for the development of Generation IV reactors .
Although there are many benefits we can gain from Generation IV reactors , we still have to face the high cost , the danger for nuclear weapons and the difficulty in preventing corrosion of nuclear metallic materials .
In my opinion , there should not be R&D funding for the development of Generation IV reactors .
Firstly , compared to the high cost , the benefit from developing Generation IV reactors is insufficient .
Generally , the Generation IV reactors are known as more environmental friendly and can reduce the greenhouse effect .
However , when we consider the high cost to build and maintain the reactors , the Generation IV reactors are not so attractive .
Jim Green writes in Nuclear Weapons and 'Fourth Generation' Reactors: "Nuclear power could at most make a modest contribution to climate change abatement , mainly because it is used almost exclusively for electricity generation which accounts for about one-quarter of global greenhouse emissions .
Doubling global nuclear power output (at the expense of coal) would reduce greenhouse emissions by about 5% ."
However , the generation IV reactor that China is going to build will cost China 3 billion Yuan .
That is almost 450 million Dollars .
How much greenhouse effect can we reduce if we use theses money in other ways ?
In other words , if we compare the reduction of greenhouse effect with the cost of building the generation IV reactors , there should not be R&D funding for the development of generation IV reactors .
Generation IV reactors would cause nuclear danger .
When this technology is developed , many countries would say that the generation IV reactors will only be used for energy purposes .
However , the IFR will be able to produce enough Plutonium to make 1M nuclear weapons by 2075 (Frank Barnaby , 2009) .
Therefore , we should be discreet on such issue .
"We are at a crossroads .
Unless governments work together to safeguard nuclear energy supplies , the rise in unsecured nuclear technology will put us all in danger .
Without this , we are hurtling towards a state of nuclear anarchy where terrorists or rogue states have the ways and means of making nuclear weapons or 'dirty bombs' , the consequences of which are unimaginable ," says Barnaby .
This is a dangerous situation .
If the governments and military organizations cannot come up with strategy to deal with this problem , we cannot afford to set up the R&D funding for the development of generation IV reactors .
The technology so far is not able to prevent corrosion of nuclear metallic materials .
However , Generation IV reactors still need some container to hold the radioactive materials .
The main materials used in nuclear reactors are Ni alloys , stainless steels , Zr alloys , low alloyed steels , copper alloys and Ti .
Apart from Ti , each one of the main metallic materials listed above experiences at least one of the following types of corrosion: Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) , Irradiation-assisted Stress Corrosion Cracking (IASCC) , Environmentally Assisted Cracking (EAC) , Intergranular Attack (IGA) , Flow-assisted Corrosion (FAC) , General Corrosion (GC) , Ammonia Corrosion (AC) and Microbiologically Influenced Corrosion (MIC) (Francois Cattant , Didier Crusset and Damien Feron  ,2008) .
However , Ti is too expensive and thus makes it of high cost to build generation IV reactors .
In this case , there should not be R&D funding for the development of generation IV reactors .
Building generation IV reactors will cost much but only reduce a small amount of world's greenhouse effect .
Building generation IV reactors will leave us in nuclear-weapon-danger and terrorism-danger .
What is worse , the technology cannot prevent corrosion of nuclear metallic materials .
In conclusion , there should not be R&D funding for the development of generation IV reactors .
As the search for a new source of clean energy is mounting due to the depletion of fossil fuels , nuclear energy comes into focus as one of the most reliable and efficient replacement alternative fuel .
Nuclear reactors are already generating 17% of the world's electricity (Butler , 2004 , p . 240) .
The latest and most efficient design of the Generation 4 nuclear is the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) .
Although there are numerous public concerns on the safety of nuclear reactors , VHTR's promising potentials and benefits in the aspect of security , cost and performance far outweighs the concerns .
The fear of terrorists invading nuclear plants and stealing radioactive compounds to make weapons of mass destruction is a major public concern .
Moreover , tragic nuclear accidents in the past , such as the ones in Chernobyl , Ukraine and Three Mile Island , Pennsylvania , leave people in doubt over the safety of building new nuclear reactors .
However , VHTR combines the latest safety features into its design .
VHTR uses helium gas as its main coolant .
Helium is an inert gas and thus it does not react and become radioactive when exposed to radioactive compounds .
The core of VHTR is made of graphite , which provides further stability due to its high heat capacity and stability at a very high temperature .
Also , the development of Leak before Break method for gas cooled reactor will reduce the risk of leakage .
The method will test leak level based experimental data on break geometry and its associated flow rate (Billot & Barbier , 2004 , p . 8) .
Preventive measures such as spiking the radioactive waste with high heat and reducing the half life of the compound can further minimize terrorist threats and increase public safety .
The cost of building nuclear reactors are expensive and the public argues that too much money will be spend on the research of VHTR; 1 .1 billion to build and to test the prototype (Butler , 2004 , p . 239) .
While it may be true that the cost is relatively high compared to other form of alternative energy , VHTR is build to last 60 years (Baccaglini et al . , 2003 , p . 19) and thus in the long run the overall cost in building is fully compensated by its length of service .
Over its 60 years of service , VHTR would have generated massive amount of energy that is worth more than the cost of building it .
Since VHTR does not incur any waste recycling , VHTR eliminates the expensive cost of building extra facilities for proper storage and reprocessing of nuclear waste .
The hydrogen gas generated as by product can also be sold to hydrogen industry to power hydrogen fuel vehicles .
Some people may belief that the performance of nuclear reactors are generally low and inefficient .
They belief that the high heat energy generated is a waste of energy in itself .
However , VHTR provides the solution to this as VHTR operates at 1000 C , the highest temperature among the 6 new Generation 4 nuclear reactors .
The high temperature means VHTR has the best nuclear energy conversion to electricity .
In fact , VHTR generates up to 600M Watt of thermal power and should be 40% more efficient than do most reactors in the United States (Svoboda , June , 2009) .
VHTR , the only Generation 4 reactor with high enough temperature to help the electrolysis process forming useful hydrogen gas which can then be used as fuel source for hydrogen fuel cars .
This means that VHTR generates both electrical and hydrogen fuel as a clean the energy for the future .
Moreover , the high temperature also enables process heat applications industry such as glass , cement , iron and wood pulp manufacture .
VHTR also incorporates the indirect combined cycle design for electricity generation , enabling a common heat source to be used for electricity and hydrogen generation .
This new design also reduces complexity and minimizes risks of system failure (Gauthier et al . , 2004 , p . 9) .
Nuclear energy is the ultimate solution as a clean and renewable energy source to curb the escalating greenhouse effect and depletion of fossil fuels .
By and large , VHTR , as the new generation of nuclear reactor , with its high performance , enhanced safety design and cost effectiveness , promises to be the most reliable way to generate clean energy in the future .
For the past few decades up till now , nuclear power faces strong opposition from people worldwide .
This causes very few nuclear reactors to be constructed worldwide in recent years .
Nuclear power has its benefits , it is more environmental friendly as compared to renewable resources , we are in the midst of producing a nuclear hybrid reactor which is much cleaner and efficient than the current class IV reactors (Butler , 2004) and they are relatively safer than before .
I firmly believed that nuclear power should be pursued .
Nuclear power should be pursued , in recent years there is a leap in nuclear technology .
A hybrid nuclear reactor known as the International Thermal Nuclear Reactor (ITER) is currently being developed in France .
ITER has significant benefits over the current class IV reactors , it produces less nuclear waste and is more efficient in its production of electricity this could indirectly mean that cost of producing electricity with the use of the hybrid reactors will be much cheaper .
ITER produces neutron as its waste which could be burned up rapidly (Gerstner , 2009) .
While the class IV reactors , produces nuclear waste that contains plutonium and uranium , they incurred a high reprocessing cost and till have 4% of the original nuclear waste left over .
Almost all of the nuclear waste that could not be reprocessed are being buried in landfill sites that could take million of years to decompose and also contaminate the land rendering it useless for other purposes .
This cost of reprocessing nuclear waste makes up the bulk of the maintenance cost incurred .
The ITER could do without the need to reprocess its nuclear waste and therefore could bring the cost down of producing electricity .
Another more significant advantage is the performance of the ITER , being able to produce ten times the power as compared to previous versions .
The ITER utilizes a new technology to contain the nuclear material in a doughnut shaped ring surrounded by a strong magnetic to stabilize the nuclear material thus enhancing its stability and efficiency .
ITER is still at its infancy it make take another 20-30 years before the first plant could be commissioned in Europe .
Nuclear power should be pursued for its environmental friendliness when compared against other forms like coal and diesel power plants and also its improved track record in safety .
Nuclear power plants do not emit huge amounts of green house gases like carbon dioxide when compared against traditional coal power plants .
Since the earth is experiencing global at a rate never seen before , there is a more urgent need to look into ways which we could cut down on green house gases emissions .
The proposed alternative would be the use of nuclear power plants to generate electricity .
There has been no major incidents involving nuclear power plants since the Chernobyl incident in 1986 .
Nuclear power plants now follow a very strict set of operating procedures which prevents any accidents example leakage from happening .
They are heavily protected by security forces , this will deter any terrorist from attempting to hijack a nuclear plant .
The last reason why nuclear power should be pursued is that too renewable energy resources take up too much land meant for farming and forest .
Renewable resources like Biofuel are produced from maize .
The United states alone consumes up to 34 billion litres of biofuel annually satisfying 5% of the total energy demand , this require 19 million hectares of land to produce .
By 2022 the demand for biofuel will increase to 136 billion litres and 31 million hectares of land will be needed to produce this amount of biofuel .
Forest would be converted to farms for cultivating maize , worsening global warming and ruing habitats for wild animals .
Another feared outcome , would be since maize meant for biofuel could fetch a higher price more farmers will choose to sell their maize crop to producers of biofuel and not to market .
This could spike an increase in food prices driving more people towards poverty .
In conclusion , nuclear power should be pursued based on improved designs of nuclear reactors such as the ITER and for its environmental friendliness and to reduce global warming .
Throughout the long-standing history of humanity , the energy has played a crucial role in changing the civilization to the new level .
But the current requirement of continuous energy supplies have grown so rapidly that many countries focus on exploiting current resources , pushing ourselves to the verge of total depleted resources  .
Therefore , we are concentrating on searching new energy source which can probably replace current fossil fuels  .Although with many advantages like high efficiency , no carbon emission and so on , nuclear energy still meets with very strong public opposition , mainly due to memories of two horrible catastrophes in the past: Three Miles Island and Chernobyl  .
Otherwise , it is still questioned about other factors like building cost , performance compared to other rivals , for example , wind energy .
In facts , recently technology achievements have showed positive signals to one of the six concepts of generation IV reactor - Very High Temperature Reactor  , which should receive more supports in both research and development funding .
The most doubtful question still appears in public is about the safety design as well as security solution to against any attempt of terrorists or saboteurs .
Many assays have been made by engineers to create many unique features to tighten the safety .
The modular design approaching  , which has high level safety requirements  , is possible to keep the core in a safe condition if there is any coolant loss accident  , secure the radioactive releases in three layers of stout barriers , while it minimizes number of classified system to maintain the simplification .
These designs will prevent any try to cause accidents to reactor from outside .
On the other hand , the safety design factor come from endeavor to overcome currents difficulties: heat- resistant fuels and materials , high fuel burn-ups , and temperature control .
First , researches has showed the modified 9Cr1Mo steel could be chosen because it has a negligible creep domain in a high temperature range 400-500C  ,yet its precious mechanical properties has no significant change in estimated 60 years of operation under the radiation working environment .
Furthermore , a C-C composite has been selected to make control rod cladding working in high neutron flux and high temperature condition .
Otherwise , engineers has selected are two nickel base alloys , alloy 230 and alloy 617 to make the Intermediate Heat Exchange  .
They have been tested to operate at high temperature at the outlet core ( 850C)  , while they can keep mechanical properties , withstand corrosion in impure helium atmosphere and avoid nitride in mixture of helium and nitrogen atmosphere .
Second , many experimental works have been made to recover the TRISO fuel fabrication with UO2 covered by good quality TRISO , modified by replacing old SiC with new ZrC coating .
Accordingly the new fuel will improve performance drastically , reaching burn-up basis of 80GWd/tHM and withstand very high temperature ( 1600C) , yet without making any significant radionuclide release  .
It would not only enhance the efficiency but also raise the thermal margin under transient condition .
Besides , public's opinions also concern about the problem of performance , the cost and the environment affection if we accept this nuclear reactor .
It is obvious that the cost of one nuclear reactor is very high  , but if we apply it to this next generation reactor , it could be meaningless .
Since this one can operate in very high temperature  , with optimized designs and enhanced fuels , hence it can produce a massive amount of energy  .
Thus , government can easily lower the cost of electric energy retrieved , which make cost of nuclear energy competitive to the others  .Furthermore , safety design also eliminate the chance of leaking radiation , make nuclear reactor a absolutely clean energy .
It should be evident that all public opposition can be solved entirely by new technology and concept .
As a result , we can affirm that the concept of Very High Temperature Reactor should be a first priority in further researches and funding to quickly turn it into reality in near future .
Nuclear energy is an alternative source of energy which can be obtained from either nuclear fission (splitting up of two atoms) or nuclear fusion (combining two atoms) .
In both these reactions large amount of heat energy is released , which is harnessed and converted into electricity .
Although nuclear energy is said to be one of the most efficient means of producing electricity , public concern towards their safety has brought down the number of new reactors being constructed in many countries .
Nuclear incidents such as the one at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979 and the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine in 1986 (where large amounts of radioactive material was released into the atmosphere , causing numerous deaths and genetic diseases) instigated fear of the possibility of such disasters occurring elsewhere .
The other problem faced is that of waste disposal , which needs to be carried out in a safe manner , so as not to pose a threat to the people as well as the environment .
The upcoming reactors , known as the Generation IV reactors , are of six types .
They are Gas cooled , Lead cooled , Molten salt , Fast sodium-cooled , Supercritical water-cooled and Very-high-temperature reactors .
The lead-cooled fast reactor (LFR) consists of "afast neutronspectrum , moltenleadorlead-bismuth eutecticcoolant , and a closedfuel cycle" (Wikipedia) .
The technical features of LFR which offer a possibility for procuring "sustainability , safety and reliability , and economic goals are the use of Lead coolant and a long life" (INL , 2007) .
The modular "battery" system is designed in such a way that there is equal distribution between the electricity generated and the other products produced , like hydrogen and potable water .
The primary concern in the LFR is due to the possibility of leakage of the fuel "either from the reactor or the onsite spent fuel" (Union of Concerned Scientists , 2005) which can kill millions of people in a radius of around 500 miles and make the place uninhabitable for many years in the future .
The problems faced in relation to security are , adequate protection is not provided against the known terrorist capabilities the NRC (Nuclear Regulatory Commission) does not use force-on-force tests , without the NRC approval changes in the facilities in the nuclear reactor and procedures operated are being made by the nuclear reactor owners .
The cost of generation of nuclear power is comparable to the generation of electricity using coal as a fuel .
In terms of fuel costs , both the costs are almost equal , as the transportation of coal nullifies the cost of the uranium used in nuclear reactors in generating the same amount of electricity .
The capital costs are more in nuclear reactors due to the safety issue involved in construction , when compared to the construction of coal plants .
The maintenance and operation costs are higher in nuclear power plants due to labour , replacement of plant parts , license fees and local property taxes .
The waste related cost for coal is mainly due to ash , whereas in nuclear plants it is from the radioactive waste generated .
In conclusion , the generation IV reactors are more advantageous over the current reactors being used because of the benefits which include , the nuclear waste that lasts for a lesser time , increase in efficiency as more energy is generated from the same amount of fuel and the ability to reuse the spent fuel in generating electricity .
These Generation IV reactors look into four main advancements , namely enhanced safety , proliferation resistance , waste minimization and economic viability .
Safety issues , cost and security requirements along with the eventual depletion of the fossil fuels , thrones Nuclear Energy as the main source of power for the future .
Having being questioned and opposed for a long period , the nuclear power , with the arising of advanced generation IV concepts , once again finds its place to help cope with global energy shortage and many environmental issues .
The Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor (SWCR) is one of the most popular generation IV concepts of nuclear power .
Like the old nuclear reactors , the promotion of SWCR is opposed by some people because of security , environment , performance and cost issues .
However , with its unique advantages and the global demand of energy , it is reasonable and to some extent necessary to support further research funding of SWCR .
With the great destructions done by the explosion of some previous reactors , some people still oppose SWCR for concerning of security and environmental issues .
It is still remember that in 1979 at Three Mile Island , the reactor exploded and killed 31 at once and spewed radioactive across Europe .
But SWCR is much safer and reliable compared with the old reactors .
It would include simplified safety features that do not rely on sophisticated backup systems or experienced operatorsall are , in principle , 'melt down proof' of an accident with minimal , if any , human intervention (Butler , D . 2004) .
This suggests that any attempt to trigger an accident deliberately by simply switching off the coolant or power supply would be in vain .
Besides , it generates little waste and some of them can be recycled .
Actually it is much cleaner than many other forms of energy that emits too much green-house gas and various pollutions .
Some opponents may question the performance of SWCR .
They doubt that whether or not it is more efficient than other old reactors .
For this question , SWCR gives us a satisfactory answer .
The SWCR system is built on two technologies: Light Water Reactors and supercritical fossil-fired boilers .
It uses extremely high pressure to prevent water from boiling at temperature up to 500 .Thus the thermal efficiency is greatly improved , about 45% versus about 33% efficiency for current Light Water Reactors (Idaho National Laboratory: Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor) .
Although nuclear energy is an effective energy form , it is quite demanding in terms of technology and the cost may be not acceptable .
Some people may question that whether SWCR is good enough to be applied widely , especially in developing countries .
Actually SWCR is simple to design and built that largely lower its cost .
This is because it has a fast neutron spectrum to generate more power for the same size of reactor and it resembles traditional LWR fuel .
Hence Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor is applicable for more countries .
Some countries even consider building such kind of nuclear plants in large scales .
Indeed we can not deny that there exist some other problems about SWCR , some of which have not been completely solved yet .
For instance , opponents criticize that some materials are not easy to find and some waste are difficult to deal with .
But these should not be the reason for abandoning the development of this promising nuclear energy .
Even traditional energies have all kinds of problems that we can not avoid .
By contrast , SWCR has successfully brought down these side effects to quite an acceptable level .
If further funding of research can be devoted to optimizing SWCR , it will become more mature and we can gain a kind of promising energy for the long run .
Energy is an important driving force for the world .
Traditional energy can no longer undertake this mission .
It can not support sustainable development .
It is high time we attached enough significance to the promising nuclear energy like SWCR by funding its research and development to make it more palatable .
With the need for energy increasing rapidly nowadays , nuclear energy is drawing much more attention due to its huge power and non-emission of greenhouse gas .
To apply nuclear energy properly can greatly benefit human beings .
However , once there is any tiny error in the process of using nuclear , terrible disasters may happen .
In the history , there were cases such as the Chernobyl nuclear reactor explosion and the Three Mile Island accident , which were catastrophes caused by the misuse of nuclear power .
Thus , how to make use of nuclear energy safely and efficiently has become the core problem for modern society .
In 1950s and 1960s , the testing nuclear power plants were considered to use the first generation of nuclear reactors; in 1970s and 1980s , the standardized ones the second; in 1990s , the well-developed ones the third; the fourth generation refers to those under research and development .
(Wen , 2002)
To develop the fourth generation of nuclear plants aims to ensure the security of the application of nuclear energy , especially to protect nuclear plants from terrorism and incorrect operations which can lead to very serious results .
For instance , the careless operation and the designing flaw in Chernobyl gave rise to countless deaths and homelessness .
Furthermore , plants cannot grow there in tens of years , and milk is not allowed to produce there in over a hundred years .
In Nuclear Power's New Dawn , according to Declan Butler , there are six generation IV reactors concepts regarding coolant , temperature , pressure , waste recycling , power output , research needs , and the year to deliver .
(Butler , 2004) The supercritical-water-cooled reactor has more advantages than the other five .
Though some of the reactors have advantage on the output and pressure , among different coolants , water stands out financially and environmentally .
Metal sodium is also not expensive but not safe enough at the same time .
Sodium has a relatively low burning point and has to be stored in kerosene to avoid it from burning which is a hidden security problem .
Thus , the sodium-cooled fast reactor is a good choice but still a little inferior to the supercritical-water-cooled reactor .
Lead-bismuth and helium are both expensive and hard to acquire , which hinders the popularization of gas- cooled fast reactors , lead-cooled fast reactors and very-high-temperature reactors .
Though water is no better than fluoride salts as coolant , the decomposition of fluoride salts at high temperatures is a great threaten to the environment .
Fluorine or HCFCs are can pollute the air and cause damage to the ozone layer .
Moreover , it does not require clean and fresh water to be the coolant , so sea water or some used water can be recycled as coolant of the nuclear reactor .
Because of the above , water is the most suitable material to be the coolant of the generation IV reactors , so supercritical- water-cooled reactor is largely superior to the other five kinds in terms of coolant .
With present science and technology level , the nuclear power can be used by human beings for approximately 20 years .
The estimated year to deliver supercritical-water-cooled reactor is 2025 , and it is within the period that the nuclear energy on the earth can last .
In general , supercritical-water-cooled reactors exceed other five kinds of generation IV nuclear reactors on coolant to a large degree and could be developed in about 5 to 10 years which is relatively short and acceptable .
Hence , supercritical-water-cooled reactor can be considered a better kind among all generation IV nuclear reactors .
Current nuclear generation(II and III) has been applied into different areas to generate secure and inexpensive electric energy .
To further broaden the usage of nuclear power , the next generation of nucleargeneration IV is under discussion .
Very-high-temperature reactor (VHTR) belongs to one of the six generation IV reactors .
Compared with other reactors , VHTR has the privilege of high efficiency and high security .
Basic researches to establish the new nuclear energy system is taking progress , and inquiries and doubts are generated with regards to safety , feasibility and cost .
The concerns from public have been a main obstacle for further advancement in nuclear research .
These concerns are inevitable , however , not necessary after synthesizing all the aspects and having a better insights into it .
Safety issue has always been the most controversial focus on nuclear energy .
Proponents have argued about the safety factor .
Nuclear and radiation accidents have alerted the critics .
Due to the complexity of nuclear reactors , nuclear energy goes wrong easily .
This could result in significant harm to human body , as it has shown in Pennsylvania radioactive steam leak in 1979 .
(BBC , 2005) Safety should be guaranteed before proceeding .
The VHTR has proved to be greatly advanced in the safety aspect .
The combination with Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor system proves to be efficient in dissipating heat and preventing radioactivity leak .
The new generation plants are inherently very safe .
Safety is assured in the new system .

Another concern is that the technology is difficult to obtain .
The prior technology problem is to find heat-resistant materials to be applied at as high as 1000 degree C . Other issues incurred from high temperature in terms of coolants and accidents also need advancing .
The basic technology for VHTR extends from the former High Temperature Gas Reactors plants .
The technology research is being developed by several plant vendors and national laboratories , such as: PBMR , GT-HTR300C , ANTARES , NHDD , GT-MHR and NGNP in South Africa , Japan , France , Republic of Korea and the United States .
(GEN-4 , n .d .) .
The researches aim at solving the technology problem and implementing the technology by 2020 .
Technology is not a problem to be concerned with .
The third concern is the high cost of research in development of nuclear energy .
Critics doubts the profit of the billions of investment .
The fund for nuclear energy research keeps rising and shows non-profit in a short time .
However , after the implementation of nuclear energy around the world , the efficiency to generate electricity will be largely improved by about 50% .
By 2020 , the portion of nuclear power in electricity production will go up to 17% .
(NGNP , 2008) In the long run , the development of nuclear energy will solve energy and environment problems involving oil and gas .
Hence the future benefit is worth present input .
In conclusion , generation IV nuclear energy , especially VHTR has its enormous advantages in the future .
It provides solutions to many serious problems .
With the advent of the new generation of nuclear energy , people will make a different in the utilization of energy .

In Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries , around 80% of health care expenses are covered by public spending , mostly through subsidies to public hospitals .
That figure stands at 85% in Sweden and the United Kingdom , 81% in Japan .
However in the United States , the figure stands at 45% which is now grappling with a controversial reform plan to provide universal healthcare coverage .
As rising health issues and living costs emerge as a threat to social stability and economic growth , the government must manage public spending on the elderly effectively .
The benefits of economic growth would help to ensure the continuity of social benefits for the elderly by increasing the national income there will be surplus to spend more money on social needs of the nation .
Businesses will get help with rental and wage bills , Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said .
The government will extend more loans to local companies and spend $600 million over the next two years on training workers .
The budget would most likely take an aggressive and long term approach to reduce costs , assist businesses and help Singaporeans overcome the current situation in order to be in the pink of economic health again .
Differing views on health insurance to be subsidised from current budgetary surpluses , and for the Government to finance more of its longer-term development expenditure by borrowing from its reserves so as to free up current revenues for social spending .
Social subsidies should be evaluated on their merits and the ability to sustain them without burdening future generations by borrowing from reserves .
We should not expand social subsidies simply because we are currently having a budget surplus .
Spending needs are growing in many areas , not forgetting social spending but we expect the government budget to be tight , therefore our challenge will be to manage the increase in social spending as our population ages , and focus subsidies on those most in need .
As our population ages  , the importance of public spending on the aged with regards to healthcare should be managed effectively without having to over spend or inadequately provided .
Social subsidiaries should be evaluated thus reduce unnecessary spending allowing the Government to finance more of its longer-term development expenditure which in turn brings about greater economic growth .
With economic growth , the financial burden will be lessen and allow more money for spending on social areas .

The world's population is growing older .
By 2050 , one-fifth of the population will be 60 years or older (United Nations , n .d .) .
To prepare for the growing demand of the ageing population , more government funding is required in providing better infrastructure and amenities for the elderly .
However , if public spending is not limited , the increased expenditure on the elderly will be at the cost of the country's development .
Thus , the public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country's development , which in turn can help to solve the problems of aging population .
Next , public spending should be channelled to the education sector , either to allow more people to get the chance to go to school or to improve the standard of education , and encourage research and development at tertiary levels and beyond .
With more educated citizens , there will be a more productive workforce (Ramphele " Rosovsky , 2000) .
In addition , as the standard of education increases , and more research and development is conducted , the likelihood of technological advancement would be higher .
Advancement in technology can improve the healthcare of the elderly , as more or better treatments for illnesses due to old aged are discovered .
Thus , public spending should be diverted to education sector and promoting research and development , which can improve the welfare of the elderly in both long and short run .
However , new or improved treatments arising from advancement in technology will incur a higher healthcare cost .
Furthermore , limiting public spending on the aged is not an easy task .
This is simply due to fact that setting a limit that is too low may result in some elderly not receiving adequate medical care and home care , and setting a limit that is too high may result in increased burden on government policies and on the working population in society .
Thus , the government needs to prevent the healthcare cost from escalatng too much and also how much funds should be set aside for the elderly .
The government can lower healthcare costs by providing the elderly with cheaper but adequate alternatives .
The Singapore government is expanding its step-down care sector , by increasing the number of community hospitals , nursing homes and home care , which can provide the elderly patients with sufficient care (Majid , 2009) .
The government should decide on the segment of the population that requires government aid in old age before calibrating the essential funds required for the elderly .
Elderly who are financially strapped and/or have no spouse or intermediate family members to take care of them should be taken care of by the government .
The government can identify this group of elderly by conducting means testing .
By adopting the use of means testing , it allows lower income patients to enjoy more subsidies than higher-income patients (Ministry of Health , 2009) .
The government should then carefully decide the necessary healthcare spending that has to be supported by the public sector , as excessive spending or spending that exceed the means of the government will lead to future generation having to pay higher tax , as the successor government is left with huge bill (Tan " .Ho , 2008) .
Population ageing is inevitable .
In this modern age , there is no doubt that up to date research and development on policies is imperative to identify problems that the elderly face .
It also contributes in the aspect of providing applicable solutions to ease the greying population which is gradually growing in society .
I wholeheartedly agree that research and development is the pathway to relieve the ageing process .
Research and development is also important to measure to what extent the government should provide sensible solutions in terms of expenditure to support medical requirements for the aged .
As mentioned , an ageing population has high demands for medications and social care services .
Through research and development , it is said that the government should support these demands .
However , a limit has to be established so that spending is not extravagant .
It is also vital that a perspective is set on the government not being the sole agent to relieve the ageing process .
Private practices in healthcare professionals , social care services and organizations for citizens also correspond to the aged .
In Singapore , Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong implemented that healthcare system will be restructured for the ageing population .
For instance , he said one key step is to link up acute hospitals with community ones where patients can receive treatment at the acute hospital and then recuperate at the community hospital (Channel NewsAsia , 2009) .
It is undeniable that research and development is important to ease the greying population .
However some policies may not only bring positivity .
An extension in the working lives of the elderly , can bring negative effects .
The ageing population is often associated with poor health thus exerts low productivity .
It will also be harder for them to acquire new skills that can benefit some industries .
Besides that , some older workers cost more than younger workers due to the seniority payment system .
As a consequence , older workers are considered both vulnerable for dismissal , or to be targeted by companies wishing to make workforce reductions , and less able to find new jobs should they loose their current work (Bernard Casey , 1998) .
However , these negatives are outweighed when active ageing takes place as the new paradigm for the aged .
Older people are active contributors in this age-integrated society .
They can remain as active providers and beneficiaries of modernization .
Research and development plays is relatively important to determine the direction of an ageing population .
Deterioration of a greying population due to problems associated with it can be addressed via strategies formed from policies for the aged .
Active ageing as the new paradigm of ageing is the key to overcome healthcare challenges and other problems arise with the ageing population as well .
These challenges are not only the concern of the government .
Other sectors should collaborate to produce the best solutions to ease the ageing population .
Lastly , it is essential for continuity in research and development for policies to suit needs of the elderly .
In fact , the aging populations who do not have families or disabilities really need the helps from others .
When they are sick , because of they do not have families or their disabilities , they cannot take care of themselves .
Thus , the welfare programs will be the vital for them .
But this does not mean that the public should spend much to help them .
One of the reasons is those who without families and disabilities are just minority , the majority of the elderly have their own families and they will take care of their elderly .
Furthermore , because of Singapore is a country which influenced by the Confucius thinking and emphasized on the filial piety , the young generation know their obligation to take care of the elderly .
Thus , limit the public spending on the aging population and divert the money into other areas of the development of country will be a suitable and accessible proposal .
In conclusion , the public spending on the aging population should be limited and diverted to the economy area and the technology area of the development of the country .
Development in economy area can stabilize the condition of the country , increase the productivity and increase more government income which could be used for the elderly , while the development of technology area also can bring people healthier bodies .
Thus , diverting money to other areas of country's development will not just solve the problems of the aging population , but will also bring every person in the country a lot of benefits .
The senior citizens have contributed a lot in making what we enjoy today .
From Fighting for independent to paving the way for our generation today to live in comfort , their services are immeasurable .
It is therefore our duty to pay back what we have inherited from them .
Thus , public spending always included the spending on elderly .
Unfortunately , there are so many hue and cries in generation today that the public spending on the elderly should be limited for the sake of country's development .
However , I opine that the public spending on the aged should not be limited because not only the elderly will get the benefits from the spending but indirectly the society will get the benefits in any sphere .
Basing the argument on the fact that public spending on aged should not be limited , I am obliged to add that other areas of the country's development should not be neglect as well .
Although the tendency for public spending to be increasingly especially to elderly , it doesn't mean that other areas of the country's development have been taken for granted .
Government should plan carefully in public spending so that they won't face the problem that can't afford equity any other way such as education , security and economics .
I think this will be a fairer system instead of limited the public spending on elderly .
Fast aging population has increasingly become a serious problem especially for many developed countries .
One of the many causes of a fast aging population is that many people choose to have very few or even no children due to many discouraging factors such as the high cost of child maintenance .
Childcare costs in Singapore actually average $670 a month .
Hence , it has been reflected in the official statistic where the replacement rate in Singapore is only 1 .29 last year , way below the 2 .1 replacement rate for a population to maintain its current size in the long term (Li X . Y . , 2008) .
In addition , the elderly often incur higher costs in terms of healthcare and other miscellaneous needs .
Hence , with such demands from the aging population , it is imperative that public spending on the aged should not be limited .
However , taking care of the elderly should not be the sole responsibility of the government .
Every individual should try to play their part in dealing the problems of an aging population .
Therefore , other strategies should also be introduced to cope with the problem of aging population .
For example , the better-off should try to support their own elderly parents through ways such as giving them monthly allowance etc .
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore has also made a National Day Rally Speech this year to stress on filial obligation for parent maintenance .
In addition , the money spent on country's development in the area of education and economy can also help to solve the problems of an aging population .
For example , the economic growth of the country can help to ensure the continuation of welfare programs due to increased revenues of the country .
Education can also help to raise the awareness of the young as well as increasing their understanding of the need for them to play a part in dealing with the problems of an aging population .

Ageing population is a fact .
It is foremost a consequence of the "baby boom" - the rapid increase in birth rates and then its decline after the Second World War .1 This period of increased fertility lasted for thirty years and the number of people born in this era was unusually large .
Population ageing has also been intensified by increases in life expectancy at older ages because of education , improved healthcare , and technology .
Such demographic changes might bring about severe consequences , most importantly national budgets might be under pressure as growing number of elderly persons are supported fewer younger persons .
The debate now is whether the nation state should limit its public spending so that the saved resources can be utilised to other areas f the country's development .
In this brief essay I would strongly argue that yes , the state should indeed limit its spending and focus more on economic growth so as to not to discriminate against the elderly but rather to aid them in a more fruitful way which is beneficial for both generations .
I believe that economic growth has its "trickle down" effect and accompanies numerous positive externalities which would help the old even more efficient way than continuous increase in healthcare spending which restrains GDP growth .

Should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?
The rapid advancements in genetic research and technology over the last few decades have led to a host of important advances in the detection of genetic conditions and diseases .
These developments have also raised concerns whether a carrier of a known genetic risk have the duty to inform their relatives about their genetic test results .
According to the National Human Research Genome Institute (2009) , genetic testing is a type of medical test that identifies alterations in a person's gene , chromosome or the level of key proteins coded for by specific genes .
An individual who only has one altered copy of a gene is known as a carrier .
Carriers will not be diagnosed with the disease but can pass on alteration to their children .
On one hand , some may believe that carriers do not have the responsibility to reveal their genetic test results to their relatives as discrimination and excess worrying may occur .
On the other hand , it is more logical to believe that carriers have the duty to inform their relatives regarding their tests results so that their relatives can make informed choices .
Hence , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be compelled to reveal their genetic test results to their relatives .

Firstly , critics perceive that there is a risk of stigma and discrimination for the carrier's relatives , especially in access to employment and health insurance .
Sociologists note that relatives of carriers of known genetic risks may be denied application of health insurance policies or have to pay higher premiums since they are at higher risk of developing the disease (Health Plan One , n .d .) .
This is because insurance companies being mostly profit-orientated would predict any possible added costs and take pre-emptive actions to avoid these costs .
In addition , healthy and qualified relatives of carriers may be denied employment opportunities (American Medical Association , 1991) .
Employers may have the misguided belief that they have to pay more money in order to ensure the working environment is safe for these employees .
The consideration of medical leaves that these employees may take in future may deter the employers from engaging their services for fear of loss in efficiency at work and trouble in finding replacements .
As such , companies will not tend to employ individuals who have medical history of genetic diseases .
However , these arguments fail to consider the measurements in place to protect insurance and employability for relatives of carriers .
Paddock (2008) asserted that the enactment of laws such as the Genetic Information Non-discrimination Act 2008 in the United States would prohibit insurance companies to reject policies due to genetic information and forbid companies to use genetic information for hiring decisions for individuals .
Moreover , a mathematical model to work out the extra mortality for individuals associated with higher risks of illnesses such as Hungtinton's disease will guide insurance companies to formulate reasonable amount of premiums (Watts , 1999) .
Hence , genetic information will not be used against family members when applying for an insurance policy or a job .
Secondly , detractors argue that genetic information of carriers will cause unnecessary worry for their family members , especially for multi- factorial diseases .
Medical professionals contend that these family members may experience psychological effects such as fear , anxiety and depression , affecting their lifestyle (Yap , 2005) .
Multi-factorial diseases such as coronary heart diseases may occur in isolation , with affected children born to unaffected parents .
Furthermore , the Mendelian pattern of inheritance is unclear even though there may be multiple cases in the same family (Lobo , 2008) .
As such , family members will be uncertain if the disease is present in the family line and fret about the medical conditions of their future generations .
Nonetheless , this argument ignores the possibility that counselling sessions can be provided for the family members .
Psychologists assert that some family members can consult genetic counsellors about their risk of contracting the disease , hence overcoming their fears (Adams , 2003) .
This measure is usually recommended for multi-factorial diseases as there is higher possibility of uncertainty in one's health .
Hence , worries of family members can be eliminated .
Lastly , carriers of a known genetic risk have the duty to inform their relatives as it would aid their relatives in decision makings .
Ethicists assert that these relatives will be alarmed .
They may perform the disease testing in which genetic results may allow them to make informed decisions especially during family planning .
Rosner (2009) argued that this is important for the Jewish community as it is illegal to abort a child during pregnancy .
With the acquisition of genetic test results , couples may consider adopting a child instead of pregnancy .
Also , couples will be mentally prepared for their child's future as early detection of diseases such as phenylketonuria in newborns can prevent death .
In all , carriers have the obligation to inform their family members their genetic test results since the advantages clearly outweigh the disadvantages .
In future , genetic testing may be more common and more people may feel the need to share their genetic results .

Genetic testing is the study of one's genes , chromosomes and protein to determine whether a person is prone to a certain kind of disease and whether the person is a carrier or not (Cancer .net , 2009) .
When a person is found to be a carrier though genetic testing , problem is arise as to whether the carrier should tell his or her relatives about the result as a carrier will not get the disease but the carrier can pass the disease to his or her children (Frequently Asked Questions About Genetic Testing , 2009) .
In my view , a carrier should tell his or her relatives about the result as firstly , there is a possibility that they might get the disease or they might be a carrier too and hence they have a right to know .
Secondly , the carrier can get moral support from the family member despite the fact that the carrier might face discrimination upon disclosure of results .
A carrier should tell his or her relatives as they might be in risk of getting the disease or being a carrier too (Lea , Williams and Donahue , 2005) .
This is because the carrier got the disease through his or her parent , and thus the carrier's siblings and the carrier's children might have also gotten the altered gene .
Hence it is important to inform the carrier's relatives so that they could go for the testing to check whether they are carriers or have inherited disposition to the disease .
If they were found to be carrier , they have the chance to choose to not to reproduce or even having mental preparation about their children's health in the future if they decided to do so .
After all , taking care of a child with disease is not an easy task .
They should consider whether they are prepared to look after the child if the child gets the disease as it is not only financially exhausting , but mentally as well .
If they were found to have the probability of getting the disease , they could then be more mentally prepared due to the early notice .
Thus by informing the relatives about the result , the family member can better plan their future and be mentally prepared for the worst .
Another reason why carrier should tell his or her relatives is because his or her relatives might be able to provide support to him .
After knowing that he or she is a carrier , he or she will have many worries and even guilt if his or her offspring has got the disease though him or her (Cancer .net , 2009) .
The carrier may also feel "imperfect" and have lower self esteem because of this situation .
During this period of time , support from relatives , which can help in coping with these negative feelings , is especially crucial to the carrier (Finucane , n .d .) .
After all , family member are the closest people to the carrier and only their support can make him or her feel better .
Hence a carrier should tell his or her relatives of the genetic test result .
Others might argue that by telling relatives about the result , he or she may face discrimination from the relatives .
This is supported by a survey conducted in 1997 which has identified more than 200 case of genetic discrimination out of 917 people who responded (Genetic Information and the Workplace , 1998) .
Some carriers might faced problems such as being isolated as if they have contagious disease; being talked behind their backs or even blamed for passing the disease when relatives are diagnosed positive (Finucane , n .d .) .
These situations will only make the carrier unhappier and hence choosing not to tell his or her relatives about the result .
However , the situations mentioned above happen rarely within the family .
Most of the discriminations are by the employers or the insurance companies .
This is proven by another survey which has stated that 550 people had been denied employment or insurance , not by family member , due to their genetic defect (Genetic Information and the Workplace , 1998) .
Hence by telling relatives about the result will not face discrimination .
It is only when the public get to know about it then will you face discrimination .
Furthermore , family member are the closest people to the carrier and if they do not support each other no one will .
Hence a carrier should tell his or her relatives of the genetic test result as discrimination by relatives is rare .
In conclusion , a carrier should tell his or her relatives about the result as there is a possibility that they might get the disease or they might be a carrier too and the carrier can get support from them .
Although some might argue that by disclosure of the result , the carrier might face discrimination , this is generally not the case hence it should not prevent ones from telling the result .
With the advancement in medical technology , people can find out and understand the various causes of diseases .
In the past , people thought that diseases were mainly caused by natural calamities and bacteria or viral infections .
It is until recently that scientists and researchers have found out that by human's genes being the cause of certain diseases such as heart diseases , cancers and diabetics type 1 .
By making use of genetic testing to test individual's genes , one will be able to know whether he or she will develop genetic disease or carry any disease-causing genes .
Individuals who undergo such tests will find that the outcome of the tests not only affect them but also their family members .
This is because there may be a possibility that they will suffer from the genetic disease as well .
Hence , the individual faces a dilemma whether or not to reveal the test results to them as his family members may not accept the fact and will be adversely affected by the harsh reality .
Nevertheless , individuals should be obligated to inform his family members of the outcome of the genetic testing as by doing so will have benefits to both parties; such as providing support to each other and taking careful precautions to reduce risks of infection .
In face of a possibility of getting an incurable disease that will affect a person for life , it is important that family members can accompany and support him along the journey to fight against the illness .
Furthermore , family members will be more understanding to patients and help them financially , such as providing for their daily expenses and medical costs .
If patient's family members are not aware of his condition , he will suffer silently and it is more likely for him to be succumbed upon by the illness .
For example , a local celebrity , Chew Chor Meng who is suffering from Kennedy's disease , has revealed his to his family and the public of his genetic disease .
Instead of feeling pessimistic towards life and being discriminated by the public , he has received encouragement from the public and support from his family that has made him more resilient and optimistic in fighting against the disease .
Hence , individuals should be obligated to inform their relatives as it is beneficial for themselves to fight against genetic illnesses effectively .
Secondly , individuals should inform their relatives as it is their moral responsibility towards them .
As there is a saying that , "prevention is always better than cure;" Relatives who are informed earlier of the genetic results can take earlier health precautions to reduce the risks of infection or the severity of the effects of the disease (Varga & Sturm , 2008) .
For instance , they can change their decisions about their lifestyle such as changing bad eating habits , saving money for their future and exercise more frequently .
Even if they do not develop the genetic diseases , the precautions taken at an earlier stage of their lives will benefit them against other forms of illnesses that may not be caused by their genes .
Some may argue that individuals who have undergone genetic testing should not be obligated to inform their relatives for fear that they will lost their privacy and cause their relatives to suffer from emotional burden of feeling guilty and anxious whether they would suffer from the disease .
However , there have been laws set up to prevent discrimination against individuals who are suffering from genetic diseases .
For example , the United States Government has implemented the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act to prevent individuals from discrimination at work and getting an insurance plan (Genetics and public policy center , 2009) .
Hence , with the governments' efforts to implement laws to protect individuals' interests , they should feel assured of their privacy .
Moreover , genetic counseling groups have been set up to help affected individuals and their family members to handle their emotional distress through counseling sessions (Norrgard , 2008) .With counseling , trained and professional counselors can provide good advice to individuals to help them make better decisions and to clear misconceptions of genetic testing .
Eventually , individuals and family members will be able to accept the fact and face it positively .
Hence , with a healthy mindset set in their minds , they are more likely to win the battle against their illnesses .
In conclusion , individuals should be obligated to inform their relatives of the genetic testing results as they can provide support for each other to overcome the illness more effectively .
If they do not do so , relatives who are kept in the dark may suffer more as they do not have the tendency to take earlier precautions to mitigate the effects of the illness .
Therefore , individuals should inform their loved ones of their situations so that they can help each other through the difficult times .
Many diseases such as Tay-Sachs disease , cystic fibrosis , Huntington's disease , dementia , Alzheimer's disease and breast cancer may be identified by genetic testing (Access excellence 2009) .
Even though genetic disease only shows a higher risk of developing the disease , it is very important and crucial as knowing the predisposition to these disease may help to reduce the risk of developing it by controlling one's lifestyle as environmental factors play important role as well  .
Thus , if tested positive with these genes , the individual should be obligated to tell his family members .
This is especially true for fatal diseases and diseases which is strongly connected to genes .
This is important to ensure early steps are taken to reduce the risk for him and his family to develop the disease .
In addition , he should also bring his family members along for genetic counseling so as to prevent unnecessary emotional disturbance due to misinterpretation of results  .
Firstly , it is beneficial for the individual to inform his family members about the result as his family may help to reduce emotional disturbance .
While genetic counselors may give advices so as to reduce the likelihood of developing the disease , family members may provide the individual with emotional support .
This is very crucial as emotional disturbance might lead to a higher chance of developing the disease .
Hence , it is better for the individual to share this information with the family members .
Some may argue that the information is the individual's privacy , thus it is up to him who to reveal it to .
However , it is the individual's responsibility to tell his family members regarding this .
This is because might be harmful for him to keep this as a secret as he might be emotionally disturbed by it .
According to a survey done on women regarding factor V Leiden (FVL) , 77% women were emotionally disturbed by genetic testing  .
When people are emotionally disturbed , they might not be able to think rationally thus this may be harmful to the individual's health as it may result in depression and unbalanced diet .
Some individuals do not want to reveal it to his family as he do not want his family to be worried .
However , not knowing the true reason that caused him to be emotionally affected will even cause his family to be more worried .
In addition , the family may consult genetic counselors to seek for advices so as to reduce emotional problems .
Secondly , the inherited genetic disease may affect not only the individual but his family too as they might also have the defective genes .
Diseases like Alzheimer and dementia do not show early physical symptoms .
Hence , by informing his family about the know genetic risk he has , he may encourage his family to go for genetic testing too .
This is beneficial as it helps to increase family's awareness and preparedness for such disease .
This may actually help to save lives .
If he is a carrier of a genetic disease , he might passed it to his offspring .
However , this may be prevented though In- Vitro Fertilization(IVF) method .
In IVF , only the embryo that does not have the defective genes will be implanted in the mother's womb .
Thus , the offspring will not have the defective genes hence lowering its possibility to develop the disease .
Others may argue that in the case of cancer , the presence of altered copy of the inherited gene account for only 5 to 10 percent of all cancers and the majority of people who develop breast cancer or colon cancer did not inherit such genes (Access excellence 2009) .
The presence of such genes only increases the risk of developing cancer and environmental factors play a much more important role .
Thus , there is no need for the individual to tell his family member about it as genes does not play an very important role .
Though it is true that environmental factors plays a more significant role , the presence of such genes in the case of breast cancer greatly increases the possibility of developing the disease .
Out of every 100 women who inherit a mutated gene related to breast cancer , as many as 60 will develop breast cancer by age 50; by age 70 , approximately 80 will develop breast cancer (learn .genetics 2009) .
Hence , by knowing this information at an early stage , early preventive measure can be taken to reduce the possibility of developing the breast cancer by controlling one's lifestyle .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic disease should be obligated to inform his family member about it both himself and his family will benefit from it .
Genetic testing is a type of testing which identifies changes in chromosomes , genes or proteins .
It is also a test that analyses and detects heritable disease-related genotypes , mutations , phenotypes or karyotypes .
There are some samples of genetic tests which are newborn screening , diagnostic testing , carrier testing , prenatal testing and others .
People who undergo the test will be notified for the results .
Some of them may show a positive result as a carrier of a known genetic .
If they knew about it , should they tell others especially their relatives ?
I believe that they should tell their relatives due to responsible , prevention and public issues .

In conclusion , the individual with the positive result in genetic testing which shows he or she is a carrier of a known genetic risk should reveal due to responsible , prevention and public issues .
This reveal of the result can help many people include ourselves .
Therefore , we should not keep it as our secret .

Since the completion of the Human Genome Project , scientists have been making many breakthroughs in the study of genetics .
Genes that are responsible for inheritable diseases have since been identified .
Now , genetic testing is available as a way to detect the presence of such genes in patients .
While the results of such tests may cause much grief and unwarranted panic , should reasons such as this justify the nondisclosure to one's relatives of a genetic time-bomb which may be inherently inside them ?
Firstly , it is imperative that a carrier of a disease related to genetic disorder tell his or her relatives as soon as possible .
Some of these diseases are curable if treatments are sought early .
Such is the case for the genetic disorder Phenylketonuria which can be identified by genetic testing .
Infants who inherit this disorder will look perfectly normal during the first 6 months of their birth .
Failure to identify and treat Phenylketonuria in time however may result in mental illness at later stages of an infant's life .
(Schuett , 2008) There are some who think that the disclosure of a genetic testing result is unnecessary and they argue that it may bring immense grief and worry to their relatives .
However , without being warned of the possible risk of inheriting these diseases , they would probably not go for their own genetic testing and hence would run the risk of having a late treatment to a disease related to genetic disorder which may have catastrophic consequences .
Admittedly , there are bound to be repercussions arising from the disclosure of such information .
Inheritance(in terms of money and assets) that one will receive is one of the aspects that may be affected by the result of one's genetic testing result .
For instance , the less healthy child of a rich tycoon may be discriminated in a choice of a successor .
However , should such important information that may potentially save the lives of one's relatives be withheld due to these personal benefits ?
On the other hand , some are worried that revealing such information to the young may affect their psychological well-being(Living with , 2009) .
Nonetheless , with proper genetic counseling which is usually accompanied by genetic testing itself , parents may decide the best way to deal with this information .
In conclusion , the result of one's genetic testing may not only affect oneself , but others too .
If this crucial information is shared among relatives without self-interest , it may even save lives .
Although this disclosure may inevitably bring about discrimination in both the family and outside the family , it is certain that concerns with health should outweigh monetary benefits .
Moreover , efforts are made by the government to pass laws such as GINA to prevent genetic discrimination .
Hence , with proper guidance such as genetic counseling , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
"Blood is thicker than water" .
Indeed , if one possesses an allele that might develop into a crippling ailment , one should not remain silent as family members can help to share the burden (Morin & Huot , 2004) .
This may also lower the risk of developing stress-induced illnesses such as cancer as well (Morin & Huot , 2004) .
Relatives prone to the disease can also take necessary precautions to prevent the illness from developing (Cancer .net Editorial Board , 2009) .
Yet , not everyone might have freedom to do so , fearing that family members might not be able to accept the news .
However , such decisions only have short-term benefits and fail to consider the bigger picture such as situations which one's family eventually discovers one's secret .
Certainly , that may cause an even bigger heartbreak (Pelletier , 2005) .
Hence , one should be obligated to break the news early to their relatives .
Earlier disclosure of such information allows the family to provide emotional support when one needs it most .
Initially , upon receiving the test results , individuals might exhibit a multitude of reactions ranging from depression to anxiety to anger (Cancer .net Editorial Board , 2009) .
This is the time where family support is most essential for one as members can help to share the problem and advise how one should handle the problem .
However , there are cases which one may not have the liberty to share the information with the family due to the unstable condition of another member .
One may also resort to this in order not to further burden their loved one .
However , doing this may result in bigger repercussions when the family member involved finds out and is overwhelmed by the news (Pelletier , 2005) .
Hence , it is essential that one should notify one's family .
Besides being able to receive family support , letting others know is also a form of relieving unnecessary stress .
Conversely , keeping such important secrets to oneself , in the long run it might actually develop into stress which may exacerbate their current condition and trigger certain stress-induced illnesses such as cancer to develop (Morin & Huot , 2004) .
Critics however may feel that individuals may get discriminated even within family which may be a source of stress for one (Wolff , 1996) .
Consequently , a disadvantageous situation is created instead of a beneficial one .
Nonetheless , not all families are unloving .
Hence more often than not , one should be frank with one's family and not withhold any results from the genetic test .
Early disclosure also allows relatives to take early precautions (Cancer .net Editorial Board , 2009) and prevent themselves from succumbing to the disease as well .
An example would be one's family shifting from their usual unhealthy diet to a healthier one .
As such , one's family may be 'empowered' (Cancer .net Editorial Board , 2009) to make apt decisions which reduce the risk of developing the illness .
However , even though the disclosure empowers one's relatives take precaution measures , it might end up causing an increased anxiety among family members (Cancer .net Editorial Board , 2009) .
In spite of this , some form of prevention may be better than none at all .
As the saying goes , "prevention is better than cure" .
Thus , it is crucial that one should tell their family .
There are certain disorders that exist such that they would have adverse effects on the health of individuals .
Genetic testing is then carried out to determine if a person carries genes for certain inherited disorders .
Of course , if the disorder is treatable , one would not worry so much about the consequences .
However , if the disorder turns out to be non-treatable , the ethical issue as to whether the carrier of the known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives arises .
Privacy and discrimination supports the fact that the carrier should not be obliged to disclose the information to his relatives .
Firstly , a carrier should not be obligated to disclose information to his relatives as he has the individual rights as a patient to privacy .
Privacy plays a very important role in a person's life as it "helps individuals maintain autonomy and individuality" (Privacilla .org , February 12 2001) .
Everyone has his own rights to decide whether their personal information should be revealed to third parties .
Without privacy , the person would feel violated as he does not have the right to withhold his information of his disorder .
Therefore , the carrier should not feel obliged to reveal his disorder .
Secondly , discrimination from the relatives affects the carrier's decision in revealing his condition .
One might never know how the relatives would react upon knowing the condition of the carrier .
The reactions can be extreme , either keeping a distance away from him or sharing the pain together with the carrier .
For example , some relatives would have the thinking that the genetic risk of the carrier would bring about bad reputation to them and they would start to distant themselves and try to lose all contact from him .
Discrimination has been found to have harmful effects on people such as a high risk depression .
It is already bad for a carrier to have a genetic risk , it would be much worse if depression strikes him .
Thus a carrier should not be obligated in telling his relatives about his genetic risk .
In conclusion , it is the social and emotional aspects that affect the carrier's decision on whether or not he should make known his genetic risk to his family members .
Time is also an important factor just like the phrase "the right time" goes .
Thus , a carrier should not be obligated to tell his relatives about his genetic risk .
The controversy of whether carriers of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives has been highly debated within the bioethics community (Mehlman , 2009) .
Individuals may choose not to reveal their positive test results to their relatives after taking the test , as they fear that their family will not be able to cope with the pressure since they are potentially at risk as well (Haidle , 2005) .
However , revealing the results may have some positive effects to both individuals and their family psychologically and physically (Chang & Haber , 2007) .
In addition , families can also help in reducing the risk of the next generation .
Therefore , I agree that carriers of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell their family .

Secondly , by telling their family their results , their family will tend to be more health conscious since they will understand that they are potentially at risk too .
In some cases , maintaining a balanced lifestyle can reduce the risk of getting the disorder as well (Rahman , 2009) .
If the results are not told , families that have a higher risk may not alter their lifestyle to prevent the genetic disorder that might be prevented .
In addition , if only one parent has a genetic disorder , the offspring will have a fifty percent chance of getting (Mehlman , 1999) .
This means that there's a fair chance to prevent the potential disorder .
By not telling this important information about the family having a risk of getting the same disorder , it's like denying the right to life .
According to the United Nations' "Right to life" , Article 10 , "States Parties reaffirm that every human being has the inherent right to life and shall take all necessary measures to ensure its effective enjoyment ."
(United Nations , 1948) .
Denying that piece of information about the well being of the family may become a violation to the right to life .
Opponents may argue that individuals should not be obliged to tell their family as this will save them a lot of pressure and stress .
Indeed , knowing that one has a higher risk of a genetic disorder is stressful and painful , however , through appropriate counseling and leading a healthy lifestyle , the chance of not getting the disorder is relatively high (Haidle , 2005) .
Therefore , for the physical well being of the whole family , it is best to let the family know the condition .
Lastly , by telling the results , families can reduce the chances of the next generation from getting the genetic disorder .
Methods like assisted reproductive technology (ART) can be used to ensure only unaffected embryos were allowed to develop to term (Norrgard , 2008) .
In this way , the chances of the next generation of getting the same genetic disorder will be significantly reduced .
Without revealing the results , the family may not be aware of the potential genetic condition .
Despite this benefit , opponents may argue that some disorder might not affect the rest of the family , so it is not necessary to inform the relatives (Mehlman , 1999) .
However , if carriers of genetic disorder , such as HIV , do not tell their family , their family , especially their spouse may have a potential risk of infection unknowingly .
Thus , carriers should at least tell their spouse their condition , so that the family as well as the next generation can be protected .
To conclude , revealing of the positive results is essential to help not only the carriers , but also their family psychologically and physically .
In addition , they can prevent the next generation from getting the same disorder as well .
Though the decision is made ultimately by the individuals , I think that it is necessary for them to inform their family .

Share The Results Of Your Genetic Tests With Your Kids - You'll Feel Better .
Scientific Blogging [Internet] [cited 2009 Oct 28] Available from: http://www .scientificblogging .com/news_articles/share_results_your_genetic_t ests_your_kids_youll_feel_better
In recent years of the 21st century , a vast majority of people has arrived at a similar cognitional conjunction of the general idea of genetic testing , which is extensively portrayed as an effective technique to identify crime suspects or catastrophe victims in various popular "crime scene investigation" television programmes .
However , the varieties and significance of genetic testing are well understated .
Genetic testing has become an increasingly adopted form of medical checkup through means of diagnosing an individual's vulnerabilities to inherited diseases upon detection of genes and chromosomes mutation (Guttmacher , 2009) .
If confirmed as the carrier of a particular genetic mutation or having increased risk of developing an inherited disease , those unfortunate subjects are not only instantaneously overwhelmed by negative emotions but also subjected to distress and burdensome in considering the consequences of their health conditions on their family members .
Various ethical and social complications arise from the differential opts of those inflicted subjects , to tell or not tell their families or relatives about the positive results of the genetic diagnosis .
Considering the genetically affected individual's need of additional care and companion as well as the early detection of similar inherited disorder amongst their blood relatives , an individual of known genetic risk ought to disclose the results of genetic testing to their close relatives .
As accepting the occurrence or increased risk of developing genetic disorders is rather emotionally burdensome , affected patients should reveal the truth to their family members who are able to provide additional care and companion .
Emotional outcomes after predictive genetic testing such as increased measures of anxiety , anger , depression , guilt and redemptive adjustments are psychologically destructive (Davies , Donnai , MacLeod , McAllister , Nicholls & Payne , 2007) .
Moreover , scientific researches provide substantial evidences showing that the frequency of catastrophic outcomes such as suicide , attempted suicide and psychiatric hospitalization are significantly higher amongst those receiving Huntington's disease predictive-testing results (Almqvist , Bloch , Brinkman , Craufurd & Hayden , 1999) .
The devastative psychological effects on risk-prone individuals can be reduced if family members show moral support and intensive care .
In fact , the risk and severity of certain adult onset genetic disorders can be alleviated by preventative measures and treatments .
With the company and cooperation of family members , constructive lifestyle modification such as adopting healthy diet , exercising as well as reducing alcohol and cigarette consumption can be easily implemented .
Thus , revealing one's genetic condition to family members are proven to be an anecdote to sufferings from psychological pressures more beneficiary as compared to concealing the truth .
In addition , to inform family and relatives of one self's unfavourable genetic conditions is an act of responsibility and care by which similar genetic testing can be executed for early detection and treatments .
As the terminology implies , genetically inherited diseases are caused by gene or chromosomes abnormality received from antecedents and passed on to following generations .
The possibilities of other family members and blood relatives carrying similar gene mutation are relatively higher when a family history of the particular genetic disorder is detected .
The likelihood of the family members and relatives to definitively develop similar genetic disease is hard to estimate due to the influences of different inheritance conditions such as autosomal dominant , autosomal recessive , X-linked dominant and X-linked recessive (Joaquina , 2009) .
Moreover , a healthy person not showing any corresponding symptoms of the genetic disease might be the carrier of gene mutation , which might bring about equivalent harmfulness to successive offspring .
Hence , alerting these potential disease carriers is essential such that similar genetic testing can be done , either to rule out any possibilities of carrying that particular DNA mutation or to detect the chances of developing the genetic disorder and apply treatments or preventative measures as early as possible .
All in all , carriers have to consider beyond personal concerns and fulfil obligations to inform family members and relatives about their genetic disorders for early detection , prevention and cure .
In conclusion , all genetic test participants carrying genetic risk should be obligated to reveal the test results to their family and relatives .
After knowing the health conditions of the affected individuals , their family members are able to show extra concern and cooperation in adopting healthier lifestyles , thus relieving their emotional distress and reducing the risk of them committing catastrophic behaviours .
Besides that , family members and close relatives of the affected individual will benefit greatly by participating in similar genetic testing and detecting the genetic disorder as soon as possible for early treatment .
Hence , it is undeniably crucial for carriers of genetic diseases to treat the disclosure of genetic test results to their family members and relatives as an obligation to fulfil .

Knowledge is power , but how true the saying is when applied to the context of genetic testing is debatable .
Genetic testing is the process of direct examination of a person's DNA molecule .
Even though it does not guarantee a 100 percent accuracy (Breast Cancer Organization) , it is still used in fields like forensic investigations whereby a person's identity could be determined through the test .
It is also utilized in medical diagnosis to reveal any genetic disorders (Human Genome Project) by basing one's genes against a healthy standard of gene pool to spot for any forms of mutations .
However , the choice of revealing the result to only the patient or to third parties is an issue that is arguable .
Ultimately though , I believe that the patient should have the final say as to whether the results should be made known .
First and foremost , genetic testing is by no means cheap .
Its cost range from hundreds to thousands of dollars in accordance to the number and size of genes tested (Human Genome Project) .
As such , the person has to fork out huge amounts of money to procure this knowledge and it would thus only be ethical that he or she be allowed to make the choice of broadcasting the results .
As much as some may argue that money does not buy everything , such tests results are akin to a paid product and it would not make sense if it were to be shared with others without the buyer's consent .
More importantly , failing to keep the results of genetic testing strictly private may give rise to physical and mental detriments (Norrgard , 2008) .
In the former case , a person's quality of life may take a hit as a result of making the outcome of the test known to others .
In view of potential discrimination against the person's disease by others , he or she may have to contemplate revamping his or her lifestyle totally .
For example , a professional soccer player predicted to have spinal muscular atrophy , a disease that causes one to lose muscle tissues over time , may be discriminated against by his team as he will most probably be seen as a liability rather than an asset .
He may no longer be considered a worthwhile investment and be passed over during team selections and such .
In the worst case , he may have to give up soccer altogether so as to allow for effective treatment of his disease .
On the latter , adverse mental effects may take its toll on a person too .
It is often said that the mind is greater than the body , hence it would not be a surprise if these detriments are more devastating towards a person's mental health .
Consider the case of the soccer player as mentioned earlier in which he is discriminated against .
He may be forced to retire from the sport entirely which may lead to him losing his livelihood .
Many professional soccer players train from a tender age to adulthood and hence , by denying the disease-afflicted person his avenue of income and his passion in life would only serve to strain his mental health .
Sometimes though , keeping mum may not be an ideal choice for there may be a genuine need to disclose the results of genetic testing to people other than the individual .
For instance , the test results of a rape case ought to be made known so that a criminal can be justifiably prosecuted .
The particular rape case of Biurny Peguero by William McCaffrey exemplifies this need well (Baron , 2009) .
In it , McCaffrey was convicted of rape even though there was no concrete evidence from the genetic testing of the swap samples that suggest so .
Fortunately , his lawyer was successful in his application for the district attorney office to release the results of the test after 2 years and a new test showed that the genetic sample lacked a Y chromosome and hence proved that the rape case was a fluke fabricated by Peguero , which she later confessed .
Although this incident underlines the importance of revealing such test results , it is under these rare circumstances that revealing the results becomes a feasible idea .
So where does one draw the line between a good and a bad idea with regards to disclosing such intimate information ?
Tentatively , there is no clear cut verdict but general scenarios suggest that the decision to reveal the genetic test result should lie solely with the individual due to the private nature of such testing and the devastating consequences that will ensue should the genetic test results be exposed without the person's consent .

In recent years , there has been an increasing trend of individuals coming forward to request for genetic testing .
Genetic testing is a form of medical examination that determines whether an individual is at risk or diagnosed to have any inherited genetic disorders or has the potential to pass it on to the next generation (MedlinePlus , 2009) .
Genetic testing includes gene tests , chromosomal tests and biochemical tests that identify result abnormalities or alterations .
If the individual does not have the final say in revealing the test results of a positive genetic disorder , there will be a breach of patient confidentiality when the individual has earlier on requested not to reveal the results and may cause even further distraught and strain within the family , even if the individual will reveal to the loved ones at a later timing .
Therefore , the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the result of such testing , since the individual will be the one answerable and holding sole responsibility in the repercussion of informing or withholding the results outcome .
Firstly , an individual will face genetic discrimination if the individual does not have the final say in revealing a positive result of genetic disorder test .
Genetic discrimination occurs when an external party gains access to an individual's health records or when one is honest in declaring one's health condition .
For instance , an insurance company will refuse to provide any insurance coverage for an individual who may have had been tested positive of a genetic disorder or has a high probability of acquiring a genetic disorder , since the insurance company finds it a loss to make a payout to an 'already or potentially-sick' individual .
Furthermore , employers will be judgmental in hiring or firing a 'sick' employee .
In America , a new federal law referred to as the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008 , to prevent discrimination from insurance companies and employers (National Human Genome Research Institute , 2009) .
Genetic discrimination will not take place if the individual had the final say in revealing the result of such testing , as the individual had withheld the information and life would go on as per normal until the disease presents its signs and symptoms .
When the individual is discovered for having a genetic disorder and not declaring the status beforehand , the individual will bear all the consequences , which includes genetic discrimination since the individual had the choice to weigh on the pros and cons of the matter before the individual made a decision on keeping the condition to himself .
Therefore , the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the result of such testing .
Secondly , if the individual requesting genetic testing does not have the final say in whether to reveal the result of such testing , the individual will have problems with his loved ones , such as stress within the family and strained family relationships (FamilyDoctor .org , 2005) .
For example , if the family of the individual finds out through the family physician instead of the individual's self , the family will be upset since the individual chose to hide the information .
Even if the individual chooses to tell the family at a later timing for the benefit of not wanting to worry his loved ones , the family will on the other hand feel that it was irresponsible of the individual not to share his/her burden with the family , since the family had to find out the truth from another party .
This could be prevented if the individual concerned broke the news to his family members so that they can discuss as a family .
As such , it is up to the individual's discretion in revealing the genetic test results .
Arguments put forth in individuals should not be the one having the final say in revealing the genetic test result are weak .
Some have said the individuals who request for the genetic testing are deceiving others if they do not reveal the positive genetic test result .
However , even if the genetic test result was positive , it does not infer that the individual has defective genes but it is just that the individual is at a higher risk of acquiring the disease (Genetic Home Reference , 2009) .
Furthermore , there will be an infringement of privacy and confidentiality if the individual requests not to reveal the result but yet divulged , since it is one's own choice that ought to be respected .
Thus , the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
In conclusion , the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing not only to avoid genetic discrimination in society but also to promote family relations .
Firstly , as mentioned above , it is not against the law to withhold genetic results from third parties .
In a democratic world , it is the individual's rights to choose if he wants to reveal the testing results .
Domestically , our very own constitution has stated very clearly that "No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with law ."
(Singapore Constitution 1999) .
Even the most powerful democratic nation in the world , the United States of America has also stated very clearly in her constitution that "all men are created equal" and "with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life , liberty and happiness .
"(American Constitution) Most notably , the word 'liberty' appeared in both Constitutions .
One of the definitions for liberty is the "freedom from obligation ," which clearly meant that it is perfectly legal for the individual to withhold his genetic tests' results from third parties , and thus is under no obligation to disclose his results .
Secondly , it is within the personal rights of the individual to withhold the information .
All people under the state laws are entitled to freedom the freedom of speech , and most importantly the freedom to decide and choose for himself .
It is an "inalienable right" of all citizens of democratic countries .
Therefore , it is within the individual's empowerment to decide if he wants to reveal the results of his genetic test to his relatives , which clearly implies that he is under no obligation to reveal his genetic test results to his relatives .
However , even if it is within the individual's legal and personal rights not to reveal the tests' results , it is still a moral responsibility to do so .
The individual has the responsibility to inform the closest around him of this genetic problem .
As genetic problems , such as Parkinson's disease is hereditary , it will be good to prepare the carrier's family psychologically .
This can allow or prompt the rest of the family to go for similar test to determine if they have developed the same genetic disorders .
Early detection allows the carrier to undergo treatment earlier when the genetic problem is still at its infant stage , and thus the problem will be easier to control as compared to its latter stage .
Furthermore , direct relatives of the individual can also plan for their own future , with the knowledge that whatever future plans that they might have , they have to put into account of the genetic disorder .
For example , if a couple wants to have a baby , and either the father or the mother is a carrier of certain genetic problems , they would consider the probabilities of the unborn child being born with the same deficiency .
Thus it is absolutely vital morally for the affected individual to inform his relatives of his genetic disorder , so as to prepare his relatives psychologically , medically and financially .
Thus the carrier is not only being responsible to himself , but also to his relatives and even future generations .
However , critics might want to argue that his relatives will alienate him , and thus making the individual feel isolated and uncared for .
I believe that despite risking alienation , the moral responsibility in telling his relatives of the problem is more important than the former as it will give his relatives adequate warning about the potential risk that might affect them too .
In conclusion , I believe that the individual is not obligated to inform his or her relatives about his genetic problems , either legally or be it personal rights .
However , he still must have the moral responsibility to inform his relatives about his genetic disorders so as to prepare the latter psychologically , medically and financially .
Firstly , a known genetic risk carrier is obligated to tell his or her relatives is because of their right to know .
They should know that they are vulnerable to the risk of family disease which can be inherited .
This allow them to have mental preparation about what will possibly happen and to react to the risk .
In addition , knowing of their genetic risk will help them in making some important decisions and plans such as whether to have children or not .
The right of relatives or families to know the genetic test results can be seen in a WHO report on medical genetic issues (http://www .who .int) , which address family members have a moral obligation to share genetic information with each another , and thus they can choose whether to be tested themselves .
Secondly , a known genetic risk carrier is obligated to tell his or her relatives is due to there is possibility to save their lives .
If the relatives are known of their possible risk in genetic disease , they can perform genetic test for themselves .
In case the test results are positive , they will be able to receive medical treatment to reduce risk .
In some circumstances , it is able to cure a genetic disease in early stage .
This allows the relatives of a genetic disease patient , or even the patient itself , to recover fully from the disease .
For instance , according to US national institute of health (http://www .accessexcellence .org) , when tumors of colon cancer are caught early , the chances for survival are the greatest and this prevent thousands of cancer death a year .
In conclusion , a carrier of known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives due to their right to know about the risk and possibility to save their lives .
With effective implementation of laws to protect genetic disease patients , they should always be encouraged and prompted to reveal the genetic test results to his or her relatives so that they could benefit from the testing equally .
Genetic testing enables the discovery of possible genetic disorders present in the individual .
The information on the genetic disorder is important to the relatives as they may be implicated .
Although this information might cause family members to suffer emotionally and psychologically , it also allows them to be more aware of possible problems that may arise in the future .
I strongly feel that the individual carrying genetic risk should be obligated to inform his or her relatives as it is a matter of personal responsibility to inform relatives of the implications and thus allow them to be aware of the possible solutions or related important information .
In conclusion , the individuals carrying genetic risk should be obligated to inform their family members as they should be responsible and fair to their family members and not depriving the members from taking early measures against the disease .
Furthermore , they should not be concerned about the negative effects about revealing the results as there are professionals in the fields who are available to aid in the problem .
However , individuals' decisions can be influenced by the fear of developing an inherited genetic disorder and the negative genetic results as a result of avoiding close relationships with their family members (Procter 2002) .
Therefore , individuals should have ethical obligation to reveal the truth of result to their relatives so that they can be treated effectively or prevented if detected with disease such as cancer .
Secondly , the limitation of genetic tests such as the social issue has been taken into account of whether to reveal the genetic results to their relatives .
Norrgard (2008) argues that the concern of the family members is the social problem of the identification of an inherited disease gene in a family .
Furthermore , Norrgard (2008) also points out that the revealing of genetic information will cause the family members to be discriminated by the insurance company and employers and families who have the risk of developing an inherited disease or disorder .
However , the Federal law has implemented the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act to prevent individuals from being discriminated by the insurance company and employment (Norrgard 2008) .
Therefore , a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives since they are being protected by law and deterred the risk of developing disease with preventive measures .
In conclusion , it is the responsibility and decision-making of individuals to inform their family members upon deciding the benefits and limitations of the genetic result .
Advancement in science , especially in the field of genetic and biomedical research , has made genetic testing possible for people to test for diseases which relate to hereditary links .
Genetic testing , a testing that looks at a person's genetic makes up , is able to confirm diagnosis of individuals who are at risk of certain genetic disorders like the Huntington's disease , {cystic fibrosis , Tay-Sachs disease , breast cancer and so}[HYPERLINK: http://www .nature .com/scitable/topicpage/Diagnosing-Down-Syndrome-Cystic-Fibrosis-Tay-Sachs-646] forth .
Despite the fact that genetic testing helps to improve one's life , it is always surrounded by moral and ethical issues that includes family-related ethical dilemma when a potential carrier of a genetic disorder is tested to be a positive result .
However , since family history always serves as a guide for genetic testing as passing the mutated genes within the family is of high possibility , results of genetic testing would have implications in the individual who tested it , and as well as the family members .
Hence , carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives once the genetic test has been conducted and the results are known .
An important reason why a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to reveal the testing result to relevant third party is that it would help early detection of genetic diseases within the family members .
This would then lead to necessary treatment to save lives .
In the case of breast cancer , recent studies show that women who suffer from breast cancer would have an increased likelihood of a sister to get the same disease (EverythingAboutBreastCancer , 2009) .
American Cancer Society (2005) also reveals that 5%-10% of the breast cancer patients inherit the mutated genes of BRCA1 and BRCA2 from their first degree relatives .
Since there is no symptom of such disease in the early and most treatable stage , revealing of testing result by the carrier would alert the relevant third party to undergo similar testing and receive necessary treatments if it is a positive result .
Some may argue that third party should have done regular check up to monitor personal health condition instead of starting to do so when there is a carrier in the family .
However , self-examine has low accuracy in detection of breast cancer while other method like mammography is only meant for women who age 40 years old and above (georgiahealthinfo .gov , n .d .) .
This might be relatively inefficient in term of early detection of the disease as female at young age would also be exposed to the risk of getting breast cancer .

Another relevant point is that obligation to reveal the testing result to the relatives does play a part in helping them to make important life decisions .
Genetic result is also desired by the relatives and potential mate if the carrier is carrying mutated gene that can cause death .
For instance , Huntington's disease is a fatal autosomal dominant disease , which is caused by the death of neurons in certain regions of the brain .
Carriers of such disease should reveal the testing results to the relatives so that the latter can do proper family planning to avoid passing the defective genes to the next generation .
"Families saw the disease destroy their loved ones' ability to feel , think , and move" (MedicineNet .com , n .d . , p .3) indicates the consequence of this incurable genetic disorder that is passed on within the family , if the carrier is not obligated to reveal the testing results .
Admittedly , confidentiality of the genetic testing results is a personal matter .
However , Burton (2009) may be accurate in saying that patient's confidentiality should come second to the prevention of disease in others .
It is also worth noting that revealing a genetic testing result to the relevant third party would eventually help the carrier to seek more advices to choose the best medical decisions .
Georgetown University Hospital (n .d) provides an example of a successful patient , Evan , who fought against cancer via chemotherapy , with the moral support and empathy from his family members .
In fact , carriers of certain genetic diseases do not necessarily exhibit the characteristics controlled by defective genes .
For example , if the genetic disease is related to X-linked genes , only males are affected while females remain as carriers of the disease , unless it concerns the autosomal recessive genes (wrongdiagnosis .com , n .d .) .
Being a carrier of a genetic disease is quite common as Guggino and Stanton (2006) note that one in 20 Caucasians carries the gene for cystic fibrosis .
Hence , there might be carriers of the same genetic disorder within the same family who can share experiences to help the carrier to understand his or her condition better if the carrier is obligated to reveal the testing result .
In conclusion , carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to reveal the results to the relevant third party as it benefits both the carrier and his or her family members .
Obligation to reveal the results would help the family members in early detection of the genetic disorder which is followed by treatment , make important life decisions and facilitate the carriers to choose the best medical decisions .

With the advent of advancements in medicine and technology over the recent years , the power of medicine in influencing human procreation has strengthened especially in the area of genetic testing .
Genetic testing is a technique to examine genes or markers near the genes , chromosomes and proteins to test the signs of a disease or disorder in DNA .
Test samples are usually taken from a person's blood , body fluids or tissues .
Genetic testing provides us with information that if someone has a symptom; shows whether a person is a carrier for a genetic disease; help expectant parents know whether an unborn child will have a genetic disease etc (Access Excellence @ National Health Museum) .
The definition of a genetic carrier is a person that has inherited a genetic trait or mutation but does not show the symptoms of the disease (Wikipedia) .
There are many types of genetic diseases such as the Down Syndrome , Huntington's disease , cystic fibrosis , hemophilia A , and hereditary breast and ovarian cancer .
However , genetic testing has raises numerous ethical issues; one of them concerning consent and confidentiality of the tested individual identified to be a carrier of a known genetic risk .
Although it is the individual's right to choose not to disclose their genetic information to his or her relatives , in my opinion , he or she is obligated and responsible to disclose the said genetic information for several reasons .
Firstly , it is important for a carrier of a known genetic risk to disclose his or her genetic information to family members as the latter may be at risk of having the same genetic disorder .
Whether an individual with the genetic disease choose to disclose the genetic information to the family members depends on how they gauge the risks and benefits of revealing the truth , their sense of responsibility towards them and most importantly how it affects them (Agatha & Angst 2009) .
It is understood that individuals who carry the disease do not wish to reveal his or her genetic results due to privacy issues or fear that their family members are not ready to accept it .
However , by not sharing the information , they are posing a danger to their family members potentially at risk of carrying the disease .
For example , strenuous exercise can cause sudden death in people with genetic diseases such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Agatha &Angst 2009) .
It is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait therefore it is high possibility that if an individual tested positive , his or her siblings would has one in two chance of carrying the same genetic mutation .
Thus , it is obligate to notify relatives so that early recognition and treatment of the disease , if present , can be done .

To share one's genetic results to relatives also in a way protect their own safety at work or any other situations .
This is so as in some workplaces , such as factories or laboratories that deal with chemical substances , will increase the susceptibility to the toxic or carcinogenic effects of environmental agents of a person having genetic disorders (Andre & Velasquez , 2008 ) .
For example , individuals who carry the sickle cell trait may increase the risk of sickle cell anaemia if exposed to carbon monoxide or cyanide .
Also , for those people who are carriers of thalassemia when exposed to lead or benzene , it is hazardous to their health and causes adverse effects .
By revealing their genetic testing results to their relatives , their family members will be able to help them take note of what he or she should avoid and assess the occupational risks at their workplace .
Thus , an individual with known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives to protect themselves from potential dangerous environments and ensure their personal safety .
However , some argue that individual right to consent , privacy and confidentiality are important and it is the individual's decision whether to disclose personal genetic results to relatives or otherwise .
There is also a legal requirement , the privacy rule of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 that the health care providers have to respect and protect patients' privacy of health information (Agatha & Angst 2009) .
However , this legal requirement is decided on a case-to- case basis as there are situations that a clinician may consider necessary intervention; that is , notifying their family members for some life- threatening cases .
For example , individuals with mutations that predispose them to malignant hyperthermia may die if they were under the use of certain surgical anaesthesia (Agatha & Angst 2009) .
Hence , it is important to notify relatives to let them know the risk and they could seek early treatment to prevent the risk and danger .
In conclusion , the carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives to protect his or her family's health as well as protecting his or hers' own safety .

Nowadays , as scientific advances are no longer a norm , our understanding of genes and how they affect our health and cause diseases has deepened .
A diagnostic test capable of identifying diseases causing genes known as genetic testing was developed along with our knowledge on gene .
Just like property rights , the result of genetic testing should belong to the owner .
Individuals who undergo the test should therefore have the rights to decide whether the result should be disclosed to a third party since public access to the result can yield undesirable consequences .
The disclosure of genetic test result , particularly a result that shows a person has a risk of getting a certain diseases or disorder will lead to social discrimination during employment and during purchase of insurance .
Therefore , an individual should not be obliged to notify a third party , even his relatives , about his test result .
Furthermore , according to the Universal declaration of Human Rights , an individual holds the rights to decide what he wants to do with the result .
In addition , there are three vulnerable groups of people in our society that requires protection if they were to undergo genetic testing .
They are the children , adolescents and mentally impaired .
Firstly , the discovery of a policy holder's test result , which showed that he might have a risk for certain disease , may prompt the insurance company to increase the price of the premium the policy holder has to pay in order to be fair to other policies holder .
Although in this way , it seemed fair to the rest of the society , the individual having the risk is being discriminated against .
Furthermore , by allowing access to the test result , it can cause problems in the workplace .
Employers have the tendency to employ the people with little or possibly no health problems .
A genetic result could place a potential employee at a disadvantage by suggesting risk of getting a disease or disorder .
In 2005 , Eddy Curry from the Chicago Bulls refused a genetic test to find out whether he was susceptible to heart ailment .
By doing so , he was traded by the team to the New York Knicks .
(Harmon , 2008) Secondly , the society has to accept the fact that all humans have basic human rights .
According to the Universal Declaration of Human rights , "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy , family , home or correspondence , or to attacks upon his honour and reputation ."
If the carrier of a genetic risk should decide not to tell his relatives or a third party about the outcome , he should not be compelled further to as this violets his rights a living .
Moreover , Professor Lim Pin recommends that the results from the test should only be used to advantage an individual or his family in prevention and management of disease .
He agreed that informed consent from the owner of the test result should be sought before disclosure is allowed .
Thirdly , there are three special categories of people in our society that need considerations .
The children , adolescents and mentally impaired that undergo genetic testing will not know how to handle their results .
As they are young and handicap , they might be immature to know the consequences after they reveal their results of genetic testing .
Then , in this case , should they be obliged to tell their relatives or the public ?
The possible unduly stress and social stigmatism that they could face might prove difficult for them to handle at such tender age .
In the United States , even though there is Americans with Disabilities Act protecting them from social discrimination , no one can guarantee that all employers followed the law .
Even if an employee with known risk for disease is allowed to continue working , he will come under stress and possible discrimination by his colleagues .
Initially , he only has the risk of getting a health problem but now with psychological stress , he could get depression instead .
Either way , letting the employer know the test result is not benefitting the individual .
Critics might argue that since genetic test result only show the risk of getting a particular disease or disorder , it does not necessary imply the individual has them and therefore , they should share the test result with their relatives to allow them to seek early prevention .
However , they failed to consider his relatives' reactions towards him just like how people react to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) patients .
In conclusion , individual should not feel obligated to disclose their genetic test result .
In fact , they should have all the rights to decide what to do with it because the repercussions that arose from the act of revealing are very serious .
Thus , individual should decide what is best for him .

Medical related technology has improved to a stage in which genetic disorders can be predicted via genetic testing .
It is a technique to examine the DNA molecule (building blocks of genes) for several purposes such as predicting or diagnosing inheritable genetic disorders , prenatal or newborn screening and to aid in forensic science .
For an inheritable genetic disease , the carrier refers to the person who has the gene related to the disease , but the disease may not necessarily be expressed in his or her but it may be manifested in their offsprings .
Although genetic testing is made possible , the after effect of knowing and dealing with the disease is another issue .
Thus , a dilemma arises in whether the carrier should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
In my opinion , the carrier should be obligated to do so as this will aid in family planning , garnering support from family and also to prompt other relatives to test whether they are at risk too .
Firstly , family planning is imperative to a carrier as he or she may pass down the undesirable gene to the children .
This means that the child have to bear with the possibility of the onset of the disease and subsequent repercussion if the genetic disease is confirmed .
Therefore , a carrier should inform the spouse of the genetic disorder so that they can discuss and plan whether or not to take the risk of having a child .
Some may argue that it is not necessary for the carrier to inform the spouse as even if the child is tested positive for the genetic disease while still in the womb , measures such as abortion can be taken .
However , from the ethical point of view , it is inhuman to terminate a life , and this event can be prevented if there is proper family planning .
Thus , a carrier should be obligated to tell his or her spouse so as to prevent subsequent tension and ordeal in the family .
Secondly , a well-informed relative of the carrier's genetic disease is crucial as they can provide support towards the carrier .
If carriers of the genetic disease who are not mentally strong decided to keep mum about their genetic disease , they may lead an anxious and depressed life (Gilbar , 2007) .The situation is aggravated if they have children as they may feel guilty of the possibility of passing down the disease .
Hence , by letting the relatives know about the genetic risk , they can offer moral support such as giving words of encouragement , paying more attention to the carriers and assuring them that it is not their fault that they have the undesirable gene .
Hence , the support garnered from family members may boost the carriers' self-esteem and motivational level , knowing that they don't have to walk this journey alone .
Thus , it is crucial for the carrier to inform his or her relatives about their genetic risk so as to get the required support to help them through .
Thirdly , family members who are aware of the genetic risk of the carrier may consider going for the genetic test themselves so as to avoid or delay the onset of disease if it is possible .
For instance , diabetes can be due to genetic causes and one way to prevent or delay the onset of this genetic risk is to lead a healthy lifestyle which excludes excessive intake of sugar .
Hence , the carrier should be obligated to tell his or her relatives so that they may also be aware of their genetic risk of the disease .
Critics may argue that the cost of conducting genetic testing is not justifiable and may not be accurate .
However , accuracy of the test can be improved through the passage of time as technology nowadays is more sophisticated .
Moreover , should the high cost of the testing compromise one's health or life ?
In conclusion , even though a carrier of a known genetic risk has the right to disclose his or her condition , the disadvantages far outweigh the advantages .
Proper family planning , encouragement from relatives and the awareness of the genetic risk in their family are crucial and therefore the carrier should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Genetic testing is a type of medical test that identifies changes in chromosomes and genes and the results can determine a person's chance of developing or passing on inherited disorders like Huntington's disease and cancer .
However , the results of the test can stir up much controversy in whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his family .
Although there is an ethical obligation to disclose the results to one's family so that constructive life changes can be made , there currently is no legal requirement to do so .
Furthermore , the disclosure can cause negative social consequences such as potential discrimination .
In my opinion , since the decision of an individual to undergo genetic testing is voluntary , they have already had the "final say" to decide whether they want their potential disorders to be revealed hence , the individual should not have the final say only after the test as long as they have signed the agreement under well informed circumstances and that the disclosure is only made to relevant third parties .
One argument to obligate is that family members have their rights to information about themselves and their loved ones .
With the information one gains from testing , one can make constructive life changes .
Many genetic disorders worsen over time and have long-term health consequences thus the disclosure of the results for an inherited disease is beneficial for early treatment and prevention of the disorder to save lives .
In the case of incurable diseases , knowing one's condition could influence many family planning decisions and other life choices .
One can decide whether to have children of his own and risk passing the gene on to his children or consider using technology to assist selective reproduction .
Also , decisions like the retirement age and the amount of savings for the future can be made when they are better informed .
When family members are aware of the truth , at risk family members can be notified early and others can provide support for the carrier to overcome the difficulties he will be facing in the fight against his disorder .
The disclosure is thus not only beneficial to the third parties but also the carrier himself .
However , individuals may choose not to reveal the results due to fear of the negative social consequences associated with the disorder .
The results of genetic testing may open doors for potential discrimination in terms of job opportunities and insurances .
An employer might not want to keep an employee who is likely to be diagnosed with some disorder .
Similarly , a person who is known to have a high risk for a genetic condition may have difficulty obtaining insurance because he or she is likely to run up medical bills that would be costly to the insurance company .
The obligation to make known the results of genetic testing will thus be a disincentive for people to even undergo genetic testing to help themselves .
As we cannot control our genes , it is unfair to discriminate against a person's genetic predispositions .
A federal measure , the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) , was signed into law in the United States , to provide protections against genetic discrimination (Norrgard 2008) .
Insurance companies were prevented from charging higher rates to customers based on genetic information and from collecting genetic data or requiring applicants to undergo genetic testing .
With the legislation being law , the carriers should feel safer to share the test results .
In conclusion , the individual requesting genetic testing should be obligated to make known the results to relevant third parties for the benefits of both the carrier and the people around him .
Hopefully , with the recent passage of GINA in the U .S . , discrimination of inheritable carriers can be removed and people will feel comfortable working with genetic counselors who can provide information about the pros and cons of the genetic test and discuss the social and emotional aspects of testing to undergo genetic tests and disclose the results that contribute to better management of health care and life choices .
Motion: "Should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?"
YES .
With medical technology advances today , genetic testing have been commonly used to detect any disorders or diseases that is present in our genes .
It is a method where the person's DNA is taken and isolated to test for the presence of any defects or a specific genes that could cause any future onset of disorders or diseases (Genetic testing , n .d .) .
Since the test involves genes and in general , every human has it , the carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Firstly , genetic testing helps to prevent further spread of diseases in the family lineage .
In family lineage , family members and relatives are related .
If the carrier is known to have a genetic risk , there may be a chance where other family members or relatives get that disorder or disease which may be found in their genes .
When they go for the testing , they are able to know if they are positive or negative for the presence of the specific defective gene .
This will then help other family members or relatives to plan ahead of their future generation .
For example , they are able to plan whether to start a family , the location and type of house to buy (in an area with family , an abundance of nursing homes , close to a specialized medical center , easily modifiable for a person with disabilities) , health , life and disability insurance , financial arrangements (wills and trusts , paying off debts) and et cetera (Drellishak R . , May 25 , 2003) .
Hence , the carrier should tell his or her relatives in order for them to make future plans and have a good family life .
Secondly , genetic testing allows oneself to be prepared upon knowing that a relative of theirs has a genetic risk .
This will allows them to take precautious and preventive measures about their health condition .
Some diseases that can be detected by genetic testing like Marfan syndrome - a connective tissue disorder causing long limbs and heart defects (Haldeman- Englert , C . , May 15 , 2008) can be controlled and treated .
When the other family members or relatives have an early detection of such diseases like Marfan syndrome , they are able to take preventive measures early like consulting a doctor , take medications that could slow down the heart rate in order to prevent stress on the aorta and avoid having sports in prevention of injuring the heart (Haldeman-Englert , C . , May 15 , 2008) .
Lastly , genetic testing promotes in developing a support group system .
This is where a positive carrier of a specific genetic risk knows that they are not alone and they could give provide referrals for respite care , medical and hospice services , tips for care-giving and et cetera (Drellishak R . , May 25 , 2003) .
So , when other family members or relatives is tested positive for the disorder or disease , at least they know that they are not alone and they could rely on the support group for any advices or any moral or emotional support from them .
In conclusion , the carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives so that to prevent further spread of the genetic disorder , to take early preventive measures and to give moral support to those who have the same genetic risk .
"The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing ."
The results of a genetic test can determine an individual's possibility of developing a genetic disorder or confirm a suspected genetic disease .
This has brought about many controversial issues on ethical , social and legal concerns surrounding the use of genetic testing .
While some argue that under certain circumstances , the non-disclosure of relevant genetic information brings harms to the individual and a third party , it in fact helps to protect an individual's right to confidentiality , safeguard against discrimination and reduce psychological stress .
Hence , the individual undergoing genetic testing should have the final say in revealing the results of such genetic testing .
There are three implications of genetic testing .
Firstly , genetic testing protects an individual's right to confidentiality .
An individual has the right of keeping his or her genetic test result confidential , and without granting consent of the individual , the test result should not be disclosed .
Admittedly , genetic testing raises legal issue , however , an individual who tested positive for a genetic disease has to decide whether to make known the results of genetic testing to relevant third parties such as family members or relatives who have the possibility of passing on the similar disease .
Regardless of the individual's right to confidentiality , the test results are disclosed under certain circumstances such as the non- disclosure of relevant genetic test results brings harms to the individual and also the third parties (Lee , 2005) .
Thus , the risks of non-disclosure override the risks of breaching confidentiality .
Secondly , genetic testing safeguards against discrimination .
In the United States , federal law Genetic Information Non-discrimination Act (GINA) has passed on to protect the individuals at risk for genetic diseases from facing discrimination by insurance companies and employers based on the results obtained from genetic testing (Public Law , 2008) .
Under this act , it prohibits employers from making unfavourable employment decisions and prohibits insurance companies from reducing insurance coverage .
Although some argue that genetic testing raises social issue , these individuals may face discrimination from employers , insurance providers and society .
It is more difficult for these individuals in applying for job employments and life and health insurance coverage .
As a result , they feel socially stigmatised .
Thirdly , genetic testing reduces the amount of psychological stress .
Although some argue that genetic testing raises ethical issue , the individual faced a lot of psychological stress such as anxiety , fear and guilt when undergoing the process of genetic testing .
The individual is in ethical dilemma of whether sharing the genetic test results within the families .
However , family members who are unaffected by the genetic disease may feel guilty and this condition is known as survivor guilt .
To reduce the amount of psychological stress , physicians should arrange post-test genetic counselling for patients .
In conclusion , the decision in disclosing the results of genetic testing should solely be made by the individual at risk for genetic disorder .
The non-disclosure of genetic information protects an individual's right to confidentiality , safeguards against discrimination and reduces the amount of psychological stress .
Increasing medical cases of genetic disorders are in pace with the development of technology nowadays .
Daily exposure to strong UV radiations by sunlight and chemical substances or carcinogens will definitely have great impacts on human health .
Genetic disorder is considered as one of the severe medicinal consequences due to either those environmental factors or genetic factors by preceding generations .
According to National Cancer Institute (n .d .) in the United States , genetic testing is a DNA analysis done to disclose the increased risk of development of a certain disease or disorder caused by genetic mutation .
Although genetic testing has remarkably improved our life , it still gives rise to many controversial issues , especially in ethical concerns .
If ones have unfortunately been verified positive results in their genetic test , this would more or less place them in ethical dilemma , whether they should reveal the results to their family members .
Anyhow , as a member in the family , it is obligated to tell the genetic test results to own relatives .
First of all , sharing information and test result with family can reduce potential disease and even cancer risk among the relatives .
Most hereditary diseases are inherited in autosomal dominant genes which imply that close kin like parents , siblings and children will have 50 percent chances suffering from those diseases ("Sharing Genetic Test Results" , 2009) .
For instance , women from family with hereditary breast cancer should undergo genetic test or counselling to estimate the expectancy of getting it .
This would rather reduce the chance of getting the cancer if preventative measures have been taken earlier .
Moreover , early detection can lead to a lower risk of disease .
Some carriers of genetic diseases object to tell their genetic test results as they think that such disclosure would not help in curing those disorders .
Nonetheless , carriers of genetic diseases are perfectly healthy and their children may only inherit the diseases ("Genetic Disorders" , 2009) .
Thus , revealing genetic test results to relatives is critical to draw their attention on the hereditary diseases .
Subsequently , they might choose to go for genetic tests .
As a result , the chances of suffering from those inherited disorders can be lowered .
At the same time , different curable and controlled treatments can also be carried out for certain diseases , for examples , Adenosine deaminase deficiency and asthma .

All in all , individuals have the rights to conceal their genetic test results in order to protect own privacy .
Federal Privacy Commissioner , Crompton (2002 , para .
3) pointed out that "the right balance" between willingness of patients and concerns of their relatives has to be taken into consideration as disclosure of health information is rather thorny .
In addition to the importance of sharing genetic test results to reduce disease risk and practise family planning , support but not discrimination by family is the foremost form of assistance to those are tested positive for genetic diseases during their illness .
Hence , individuals who carry genetic diseases are obligated to disclose their test results among their relatives .

Genetic testing is whereby an individual's gene is tested for abnormalities , susceptibility for diseases or any genetic disorder that can lead to either physical or mental problems , including both .
It is beneficial as it points out the underlying genetic condition of an individual who is prone to a particular genetic disorder , giving the individual the opportunity to seek treatment before the genetic disease comes into effect (Nuffiel Council , 1997) .
Since the affected individual shares similar gene within the family , he or she is obligated to let his or relatives know about the genetic condition .
Although it can affect the rest of the family and relatives , as having to know one's genetic condition can bring about genetic discrimination such as denied insurance coverage , loss of employment , it basically prepares them psychologically for the future and there are certain regulations implemented to help those who are genetically discriminated .
Firstly , it may help prevent the individual from encountering a situation where he is denied of insurance coverage when the health insurer finds out the affected individual could prone to a one or more genetic disease due to family history .
Such cases happen due to the health insurer is bent on making money , with no care on whether the person is in ill health(Townsend , 1997) .
There are policies such as in Britain , which insurance companies should adhere to , where any genetic screening is not a prerequisite in the application and obtaining insurance .
Even if it is to be declared , there will not be a change in premium charges as compared to those who declared who has a family history but has not gone for genetic tests .
Thereby , it can help ensure that the affected person is able to be under insurance coverage , providing some security especially financial security including for the family members .
Secondly , having one genetic condition assessed , it gives the affected individual the freedom of making an informed choice concerning the type of job or employment that he or she can undertake , with the inclusion of one's safety and health .
This helps the individual to avoid certain occupations that might increase the risk of having to be ill health or end up in a life threatening situation during one's course of work (Nuffiel Council , 1997) .
An example would the Huntington's disease , a neurological disorder where loss of motor control is one of the symptoms , if a particular employee in a construction yard has such a disease , not only it poses high risk to himself but also to the other employees (Mclean , 2008) .
However , although having the knowledge of one's susceptibility to a particular disorder may cost the employee's his or her job employment , so as to reduce costs and improve efficiency for the employer , there are regulations to help such employees .
In the United Kingdom , there is the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978 which helps to ensure fairness on the employee's part after a genetic screening .
Thirdly ,by letting the family members and relatives made known of an individual genetic risk a particular disorder such as Huntington's Disease , it made them aware that such a genetic disease runs within the family .
Although it can affect the family drastically , it is better to be prepared rather than be caught on by surprise .
This is because when one is aware of it especially the parents , they can seek treatment even before the genetic disorder comes into effect , thus leading to little or no drastic change in one's lifestyle .
An example would be neonatal screening for sickle cell disease , when an affected child is diagnosed with this disease at an early stage , it can reduce childhood mortality and morbidity (Nuffiel Council , 1997) .
Although the knowledge that there is a chance that the relatives themselves or their future children can have the same genetic disorder can cost them higher insurance premiums or even deny them of insurance coverage , there are regulations which can help them from being discriminated .
In America , there is the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) which helps provide protection for those who have undergone genetic testing and are at risk for certain genetic disorder (Norrgard , 2008) .
In short , when the relatives of the individual who is tested positive for a certain genetic disease , may have raised fears such as unable to obtain insurance or loss of job , it does not necessarily mean that it will happen as there are policies and regulations implemented to help those who are genetically discriminated .
However , most of all , it helps create more awareness which can play a major role such as making a more informed family planning or how much money to be put aside for a better retirement (Norrgard , 2008) .
In this twenty-first century , health care has improved more drastically than ever , with the help of advanced technology that made diagnosis and treatment of diseases feasible and convenient .
Nowadays , genetic testing is becoming more and more prevalent to those who can afford and the diagnostic result can determine any possible genetic illness that an individual might suffer or carry .
Genetic testing basically uses laboratorial techniques to examine the genes of an individual and identify any inheritable disease like Huntington's disease present .
Thus , individuals with such genetic disease but do not suffer from it are called carriers as they can pass it on to their future generations .
However , there are some ethical and social issues regarding to whether family of the carrier should inform his or her relatives .
Although these issues are inevitable , the carrier should ultimately obligated to reveal the genetic test results to the family members as the benefits of it would outweigh any other problems .
Firstly , disclosure of genetic test results to family members can reduce the risk of danger of the genetic disorder by treating it early and before any effects of the illness starts kick in .
Treatable genetic disease like hemophilia which causes excessive bleeding in damaged tissues and occurs usually in the beginning of adulthood .
This could be treated via injection of recombinant factor VIII concentrate into the veins within an hour when excessive bleeding starts .
(Gene Reviews) Hence , this is crucial to save a hemophiliac from over bleeding especially if he or she is unaware of such condition .
In other words , knowing the risks of the genetic disorder can allow preventive medical treatment to reduce the risks of danger to the affected individual .
Furthermore , a change in lifestyle can also reduce possible effects of genetic disease like homocytinuria which is the genetic disorder of collagen through a therapeutic diet .
(Connective Tissue Disorder Site) Thus , it has become a personal responsibility of the carrier to inform the family members of such risk in order for early medical intervention to save the lives of his or her loved ones .
However , opponents of this position may argue that genetic testing does not provide a definite prediction on the individual's health .
This is because this method only gives the probability of contracting the disorder and many might not even suffer any effect of the gene disorder .
(Human Genome Project Information) Therefore , disclosing genetic test result to family members would only cause unnecessary anxiety to them , which can greatly affect their quality of life .
On the other hand , proponents can argue that life should not be gambled with and especially when it involves with the loved ones .
Hence , it is not ethically wrong to inform relatives of the carrier about the possible risk and the decision to whether they should undergo similar genetic testing would then be up to them .
In conclusion , the disclosure of genetic disorder of the carrier to the relatives can be very beneficial to their welfare as they can take preventive medical intervention and also decide whether to bear a child who might suffer the similar effects .
Although genetic testing is not always definite in predicting illnesses , no one would ever know if the genetic disease might occur and early prevention can ultimately saves the individual's life .
Therefore , genetic counseling is very crucial for mediating such dilemma that a carrier might face as the experts can give professional advice on the advantages and disadvantages .
More importantly , the consequences of a genetic test on an individual should be made known to him or her before making such decision .
Genetic research and testing have advanced tremendously in recent years with tools such as the Genome Project (US National Institute of Health , 1998) .
As such , genetic testing is becoming more readily accessible for people to have their genes tested for any indication of greater risk of developing any diseases (US National Institute of Health , 1998) .
If an individual discover after a genetic test that he has a high risk of developing certain disease , it would mean that his family member who share similar genes may be at risk as well (Forrest K , 2003) .
Not only it is his responsibility to share his genetic testing results with his family (Forrest K , 2003) , informing his family members will give them a chance for early detection of the disease as well as to make necessary family planning (Agatha M , Denise B and Kathleen A , 2009) .
Hence , carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his family members his genetic testing result .
Firstly , it is the responsibility of the carrier of a known genetic risk to inform his family member of their increased likelihood of having the same genetic risk (Forrest K , 2003) .
Since all the family members share similar genes and DNA , the discovery of any members with a genetic risk of certain disease means that the rest of the family members are likely to have the same risk too (US National Institute of Health , 1998) .
Being in the same family , it is one's responsibility to taking care of each other's well-being (Forrest K , 2003) .
Critics of this point claim that there is a need to protect family members from the troubling information and that some of the family members may not be able to cope emotionally if revealed that they may be at high risk of a genetic disease (Agatha M et al . , 2009) .
However , these concerns can be addressed by counseling as well as moral support from family members and the medical benefits that the family members can get from the information justifies the need to reveal the information to them (Forrest K , 2003) .
Hence , to fulfill the responsibility as a member of the family , carrier of genetic risk should tell his relatives his genetic test result .
Secondly , sharing of the fact that one has a greater risk of genetic disease will encourage his relatives to go for genetic testing (Forrest K , 2003) .
The relatives can make an informed decision as to whether they want to have a genetic testing done themselves .
If they are tested with the same increased genetic risk , it will allow them to have early preventive medical treatment (US National Institute of Health , 1998) .
The family members can also then consider family planning based on the severity of the disease and the likelihood of passing the disease to the next generation (Agatha M et al . , 2009) .
Opponents of this position argue that the family members may hastily undergo a genetic test on receiving the negative news without careful consideration of the possible discrimination that they may face after the genetic test (Agatha M et al . , 2009) .
Admittedly , it is true that one may face discrimination at work and from insurance companies after a genetic test (US National Institute of Health , 1998) .
However , with the setting up of legislative law by governments , such as the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act in the United States , the risk of discrimination at work or from insurance companies will be kept to a minimum (US National Institute of Health , 1998) .
Thus , genetic risk carrier should not hesitate to tell his relatives so that they can benefit from the information medically .
In conclusion , revealing of the genetic test result by the carrier of genetic risk is not only his responsibility to his family members; it also allows his relatives to have a chance of early detection of the disease and possible treatment as a result .
No doubt that this may bring emotional stress to the relatives , but if managed properly , the medical benefits that the relatives can get from the information outweigh this initial risk .
Therefore , carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his family members his genetic testing result .
Genetic Testing grants us the ability to determine an individual's paternity and his chances of getting a genetic disorder such as Down syndrome .
There are three forms of genetic testing - Gene tests , chromosomal test and biochemical test .
Since Genetic testing is voluntary , the individual should have the final say in whether to reveal the results .
This is because there are many social and emotional aspects with regards to genetic testing .
Revealing an individual's genetic makeup and results without their consent can also lead to an infringement of human rights and privacy .
Also , these individuals may face discriminations from family members and also from the society , such as their employers and insurance companies .
Therefore , the carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives to prevent such genetic testing results from being passed on to other third parties without consent .
An individual is not obligated to reveal the results of genetic testing to third parties due to the infringement of privacy and human rights .
Like medical records , results of genetic testing should be kept confidential and they should not be disclosed without permission (Mehlman1999) .
Since genetic testing requested by an individual involves the use of own genetic makeup , it is therefore against human rights to reveal the genetic testing results without their contest .
Every individual should be given the right to decide whether to disclose the genetic testing results to their relatives by weighing the advantages and disadvantages on their own .
This is based on the fact that everyone is unique and they have different background and personal constraints to take into considerations when deciding whether to reveal their genetic testing results .
Thus , the carrier of a known genetic risk is not obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Another reason such why genetic testing results should not be revealed to relatives is because other third parties may have the chance to get hold of these results and use them against the individuals .
There are many controversies on the fairness in the use of genetic information by other third parties such as insurers , employers , adoption agencies , schools , military and courts .
It is not fair for insurers to deny insurance or raise premiums base for individuals that have positive results from genetic testing (Mehlman1999) .
Andre and Velasquez mentioned that being a carrier for a genetic disorder does not mean that the individuals will get the disorder for sure .
Therefore , it is justified for the carriers to buy insurance so that they can get a sufficient amount of coverage as compensation for any mishap that may or may not happen .
Raising premium for such individuals is seen as taking advantage of them .
Also , employers may stereotype these individuals as non-productive and inefficient workers and choose not to hire them (Weiss 1999) .
Therefore , the carriers of genetic disorder should not be obligated to reveal the results to anyone to prevent from having to face discriminations at societal level .
Proponents in favour for the revealing of results argue that revealing the results to third parties such as relatives can aid in emotional support .
Relatives can provide necessary help to the carriers by providing more care and concern .
This is necessary because carriers of genetic disorders undergo tremendous stress and it would be great if there is someone close to be there with them to face all kinds of problems .
Furthermore , revealing the results to the relatives can encourage them to be more health conscious and also to remind that to take go for frequent checkups since they might run the risk of having the same disorder too (Weiss 1999) .
However , this does not apply to all individuals and there is a possibility that they may even face discriminations from their own family members and relatives .
Some may feel that the individuals are likely to be a burden to them and may start to shun or keep away from them , causing them to feel even more upset or depressed .
Therefore , the final decision on whether to reveal the genetic testing results should lie in the hands of the carriers themselves .
In conclusion , the revealing of genetic testing results may bring more problems than solutions to the individual and therefore they should be given the final say in whether to reveal the results .
Many problems such as discrimination and psychological stigmatisation attributed from the release of genetic testing should be taken into consideration when deciding whether to reveal the genetic testing results as they can worsen an individual's health condition .
Should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell 3rd parties ?
Genetic testing is a medical test which looks at the DNA makeup of an individual .
The advantages of genetic testing include diagnosis of current or future diseases , prevention or early treatment and reduced disease risk in future generations (American Association for Clinical Chemistry [AACC] , 2009; Riper , 2005) .
Some possible disadvantages include anxiety , stress and strained family relationships (AACC , 2009; Riper , 2005) .
After an individual has undergone genetic testing , is it necessary for him to share his test results with 3rd parties (someone other than his doctor) ?
While sharing can improve workplace safety and family health , it may also lead to genetic discrimination or unnecessary stress for both the patient and his family (Nuffield Council on Bioethics [NCB] , 1993; Sobel and Bursztajn , 2000) .
However , there are antidiscrimination laws and stressed individuals can seek genetic counseling (AACC , 2009; Human Genome Management Information System [HGMIS] , 2008) .
Hence , an individual should be obligated to tell 3rd parties his genetic test results .

Firstly , sharing of genetic test results benefits the individual with regards to working environment .
Some work environments may increase disease risk in individuals with a particular genetic makeup .
For example , individuals with the genetic disorder , alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency have higher risk of getting related diseases when exposed to smoky environments (NCB , 1993) .
Thus , employers can have alternative work arrangements for these at-risk employees .
Opponents of this position argue that revelation of genetic test results to 3rd parties will cause individuals to face genetic discrimination .
Sobel & Bursztajn (2000) reported that the American Management Associated did a survey on this and results showed that 7% of employers use employee's genetic information for employing and job advancement decisions .
For instance , an employer fired an office worker with a genetic disease due to not wanting to cover her high treatment costs under the company's health care benefits for workers (Sobel & Bursztajn , 2000) .
However , there are antidiscrimination laws (Sobel & Bursztajn , 2000) .
Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was signed into law by President George W . Bush on May 2008 (HGMIS , 2008) .
GINA forbids genetic discrimination by employers and health insurers (HGMIS , 2008) .
Therefore , revelation of genetic test results to others , benefits the individual .
Secondly , sharing of genetic test results can improve family health .
When an individual is identified to have a gene mutation associated with a disease , his family and relatives may also have that gene mutation .
His direct family has 50 percent chance of having the same mutation while his extended family has 25 percent chance of having the same mutation (Norrgard , 2008) .
Hence , that individual should inform his family and relatives so as to advise them to take genetic testing .
If his family or relatives are found to have the same gene mutation , early treatment or preventive measures can be taken .
Critics argue that genetic information may cause negative emotional and psychological effects on family and relatives (AACC , 2009) .
However , genetic counseling is available , to help them cope with their psychological problems (AACC , 2009) .
Thus , the revelation of one's genetic test results to family and relatives , benefits them .
In conclusion , an individual should reveal his genetic test results to 3rd parties as it improves workplace safety and family health .
Sharing of genetic results not only benefits himself , but also his family and relatives .
If one loves his family , one should let them know his genetic test results .

As science develops rapidly , genetic testing , one of the most advanced technology , has become a common component of medical care .
According to the definition from BIO (Biotechnology Industry Organization) , genetic testing is "the analysis of an individual's genetic material" (2009) .
This new technology can help to identify genetic disease .
However , the controversy is that if the individual who carries a genetic risk should tell their relatives the results of genetic testing .
Some emphasize the significance of personal privacy , and show the concern of genetic discrimination .
However , because the whole family shares the same set of genes , they have the right to know the result of the genetic test .
For the carriers , telling the result to their families is not only showing their responsibility to the family and society , but also the best way to ensure they get the best care .
Firstly , it is their responsibility to tell the relatives the result of the genetic test .
According to the article Genetic testing is all in the family by Jeffery P . Kahn , Director of Centre for Bioethics , University of Minnesota , the family has the right to know the result of the genetic test of any member in the family .
Since the whole family shares the same set of genes , the information the individual provides through the genetic testing may have just as much meaning for the family as for him or herself (Kahn , 2000) .
Therefore , these results should be told , no matter they are good or bad .
However , some may claim that the individuals have the right to protect their privacy (Kahn , 2000) , and like other private information , genetic information should be protected properly , and people have the final say whether to reveal it to others .
However , here there is something more important than privacy .
Genetic disorder only can be treated if those carriers of a known genetic risk decide to reveal their genetic result .
Moreover , we can only protect our children from inherited disease if we know whether there is a genetic risk .
As a result , the carriers of a known genetic risk should tell their relatives .
Secondly , it ensures that those carriers of genetic risk get the best care from family and society if they are willing to tell the test results .
As we all know , genetic disorder is not contagious and there is no risk for those people who want to offer help .
However , sometimes when there is high pressure , like knowing they are having genetic disorder , the individuals cannot make decisions properly , while their family and professional can take good care of them and make the best decision for them (Forrest et al . , 2007) .
Someone may claim that other people's decision may lead potential dangers for the person concerned (Forrest et al . , 2007) , since we are not them and cannot know exactly what they need .
However , as known to all , a group with several professionals will have more knowledge and experience than the individual , and the family members of the carriers will selflessly take care of them .
Therefore it is better for the carriers to tell their relatives the test results .
To draw a conclusion , for the carriers of genetic risk , it is better to tell the genetic test results to their relatives because it is an action not only showing their responsibility to the family and society , but also ensuring that they can get the best care .
Nowadays , as the technology of genetic testing has been well-developed , people who are at risk of genetic disorder may request for such testing to determine their health condition .
To some extent , the results of genetic testing can help people to detect certain disease and take measures to reduce the risk .
However , the abuse of the results may cause many issues .
Revealing the results of individual genetic testing without individual's permission may lead to invasion of privacy and social discrimination .
Hence , the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
An important reason why individual should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of genetic testing is because people have the right to protect their privacy .
The decision of informing family members the results should be a personal choice .
Because the results of genetic testing not only affect the person who takes the test but also relate to his family members , sometimes people may encounter dilemmas .
Individuals may make different decision depending on their situations .
For example , after undergoing genetic testing , people may find out that their siblings also have the same genetic disorder with themselves .
However , informing them may result in huge changes in their life decisions .
Thus , whether to tell them the results or not is a cautious decision that should be made by individuals (Norrgard 2008) .
Some may suggest that it is an ethical responsibility for people who are found to have genetic disorder to inform the results to their family members .
However , since currently there is no legislation forcing people to do so , the results should be treated as privacy and should be protected (Norrgard 2008) .
Another reason is that the misuses of genetic testing results may cause social discrimination .
If the results of individual genetic testing are revealed to employers and insurance companies , employers may not hire people who are diagnosed by with certain disease .
Likewise , insurance companies may also refuse to serve people who have high risk of some disease (Maxwell & Mehlman 1999) .
Opponents may argue that law can be used as a mean to protect against genetic discrimination .
They cited that a number of laws have been enacted to prohibit insurance companies from collecting information of genetic testing and using them to discriminate against people (Maxwell & Mehlman 1999) .
However , this approach is not effective .
Firstly , most laws only restrict types of genetic information , but they do not ensure that people will be fairly charged if they reveal genetic testing results (Norrgard 2008) .
Secondly , laws still have limitation of prohibiting employers from refusing people who have genetic disorder (Maxwell & Mehlman 1999) .
Hence , using legal power to limit discrimination is incomplete .
To conclude , since genetic testing results are people's privacy and revealing them may cause social discrimination , the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
Oxford Dictionary defines genetic testing as the sequencing of human DNA in order to discover genetic differences , anomalies , or mutations that may prove pathological .
One of the many ethical issues associated with genetic testing involves the question of whether a known carrier of a genetic condition is obligated to tell his or her relatives .
While the individual has no legal or professional obligation to inform his relatives , he nevertheless has a very strong moral obligation to do so as his relatives who may have inherited the condition can take action to improve the prognosis as well as prepare themselves mentally and socially , not revealing this information can be interpreted as negligence on the part of the carrier , and telling his relatives will allow them to anticipate lifestyle changes to accommodate his condition as well as readies them for possible financial strain that may be brought about .
First of all , it is a known fact that genetic conditions may be hereditary and thus indirectly involves the relatives of the carrier as well , putting the carrier's relatives at a possible risk having the condition as well .
The carrier is at least morally obligated to inform his relatives from an altruistic point of view .
In the event that one of the carrier's relatives discover that he is affected by the disorder , preventive measures can be taken in anticipation of the disease and in the event that the disease is incurable , palliative steps can be planned .
An example of prevention would be an individual affected by the BRCA gene undergoing a mastectomy which would reduce the chances of developing breast cancer from 85% to 1% (http://www .medscape .com/viewarticle/573060) .
Beyond telling them , the decision to undergo genetic testing is purely up to the relatives themselves .
While some might say that there is no point of knowing if a disease has no cure , knowing has its benefits as it not only prepares the individual in the physical aspects of the disease but also the psychological aspects .
In the event that a relative tests positive for a genetic condition , it is not only the physical aspects of the diseases that must be considered , but also the psychosocial aspects of the disease .
Having known that he is at risk of a genetic condition , an individual will be able to anticipate the possibility that he might be afflicted with the disease and mentally prepare for that possibility .
He will be able to work towards acceptance of the fact that he might have the condition and be able to adapt easily to it in the event that the condition manifests; as opposed to the condition striking suddenly without prior warning .
Furthermore , he will be able to also mentally prepare for any stigma or discrimination that he may face in society as it has been shown that identifying patients in need of psychosocial support will enhance effect on well being (Mind and cancer: does psychosocial intervention improve survival and psychological well- being ?) .
Although some people prefer to be carefree and prefer not to know at all as they cite the fact that knowing will make them anxious and stressed , the onus is on them to go for the genetic testing to determine any abnormalities .
If ignorance is their choice , it is their right to go along with it .
While the obligation for a carrier to tell his relatives may be considered as a breach of privacy , not telling them at all is tantamount to negligence , especially if the genetic condition is known to be hereditary .
It is only responsible to inform someone if there is a possibility that their life may be severely affected because of a disease .
If you knew there was a murderer in your neighbor's house , would you not inform them ?
In the perspective of a carrier's relative , most people would definitely want to be informed if they are at an increased risk of having a genetic condition .
Undoubtedly , for some genetic risks , there will be a stronger case for the duty to warn relatives about it especially in serious conditions like breast cancer (BRCA-1) and Huntington's Disease (On warning families about genetic risk: the ghost of Tarasoff) While there is an issue of a not having confidentiality on the matter , at least the carrier can sleep well at night knowing that he has fulfilled his responsibility .
It must also be noted that several genetic conditions are highly debilitating and will inevitably have a huge impact on family members , who are usually the main care givers physically as well as socially .
If this is the case , family members have a right to know what to expect of the disease and to what extent they will have to adjust their lives to accommodate the carrier .
In this sense , the carrier is thus obliged to inform his family members of his genetic test in order for his family members to prepare for a possible change in lifestyle .
It will also allow the family to assess the extent of the disease and make preparations in the event that they are unable to accommodate the carrier such as sending the carrier to a nursing home or employing a full-time nurse to assist in care giving .
This is opposed to have the disease suddenly dropped on them like a bombshell which would cause severe disruption in their lives .
For example , it is shown that the majority of people with Alzheimer's disease are cared for in the home , which may affect the work situation of the caregivers , their own health , and their finances (http://family .jrank .org/pages/70/Alzheimer-s-Disease- Impact-on-Family .html) .
A negative point to this is that family members may view the carrier as a burden even before the condition manifests and this may be a source of tension in the family .
Nevertheless , it should be pointed out that it is better to be safe and sorry as in this case , the burden has a strong potential to manifest and it would be better to sort out any misgivings before the condition strikes rather than after .
Finally , the financial effect of the disease on the carrier and his relatives must also be considered in the ethical reasoning of this argument as the financial aspects of a disease may be far reaching especially for families in the low income group .
This especially applies more to certain diseases like diabetes mellitus or cancer in which the cost of treatment puts a severe strain on the finances of a family .
A carrier is thus obliged to tell his family members in order for them to start thinking ahead by starting initiatives like saving plans or taking up more jobs .
The family will also be able to start looking for avenues of financial assistance even before the disease strikes .
To emphasize this point , studies have shown that economic hardship requires households to make difficult decisions between care and basic living expenses , which at times compromises necessary treatments and health care (economic hardship requires households to make difficult decisions between care and basic living expenses , which at times compromises necessary treatments and health care) .
While some might argue that there is little that people in the low income groups can do to prepare for this and it might simply cause unnecessary stress for them; it must be pointed out that it is even more important for this group of people to plan ahead for the future as they will very likely lack sufficient resources to deal with it when the problem surfaces .
Considering all the points put forth above , I would very much think that there is a strong moral obligation for a carrier of a genetic defect has to tell his relatives about the results of his genetic test .
Allowing them to know will serve as a warning for them to take preventive measure or prepare for the worst as well as readying family members for the possibility that the condition associated with the genetic abnormality may one day surface .
Despite the arguments of privacy of the individual , feelings of helplessness , possible family tension and increasing the level of stress within a family , I still feel that the moral obligation to let the carrier's relatives know far outweighs these points .
Ultimately , it must be recognized that the carrier of a genetic abnormality is only obliged to tell his relatives; subsequent action taken beyond that is out of the scope of the obligation of the carrier .
The advancement in science and technology has enabled the determination of genetic risk of disease development by means of genetic testing .
Although it is an improvement in the scientific world in view of combating diseases , ethical dilemma is born in the communication of genetic risk in families .
Some have suggested that the issue is related to privacy concern and the disclosure of genetic information may cause anxiety , guilt , depression and other disadvantages in both individuals and their relatives (Norrgard , 2008) .
However the importance of the moral obligation individuals have for their family and the consequences for family planning and personal health of at-risk relatives should not be neglected .
In fact the potential for harm to uninformed relatives outweighs the individual's right to confidentiality and therefore the carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Forrest and her team stated that "the responsibility of disseminating genetic information to family members lies largely with the individual" (Forrest , Delatycki , Skene , Aitken , 2007 , para .2) .
Individuals may possess duty of care and/or moral obligations to communicate the potential genetic risk to relatives .
According to a documented research done by Clarke , Richards , and Kerzin-Storrar , among the 40 ,000 clients attending genetics clinics over a 1-year period world-wide , only 65 were reported as non- disclosure cases a frequency of non-disclosure that was shown to be less than 1% of all genetics consults .
(Clarke , Richards , Kerzin-Storrar , 2005) Indeed , the moral obligation of individuals to their family and relatives is a compelling argument supported by "kinship bonds and an assumed desire to protect family members from harm" (Forrest et al , 2007) .
Some have argued that individuals may not disclose genetic information because they prefer not to contact relatives personally (Consent and Confidentiality in Genetic Practice: Guidance on Genetic Testing and Sharing Genetic Information , 2005) , and they are embarrassed about reporting bad news (Wertz , 2003) , or they are unable to communicate directly with family members (Ethical Aspects of Human Genetic Testing: An Information Paper , 2000) .
Nevertheless , one can seek assistance from genetic health professionals to address the above problems by "having the genetic health professionals to communicate the genetic information to family members at the client's request" (Forrest et al , 2007) .

Sermijn had done a research involving family relatives who revealed a lack of understanding and awareness that a genetic risk was present in their family (Sermijn et al , 2004) .
However this may not be a reason for individuals to withhold genetic information from their relatives .
UK Nuffield Council on Bioethics states that "both individuals and family members have responsibilities to be willing to give and receive genetic information" (Forrest et al , 2007 , p614) .
Effective communication strategies can be employed to achieve a positive outcome of communication by assessing the vulnerability and receptivity of family relatives .
This can be achieved through personal understanding or advices given by genetic health professionals (Gaff , 2007) .
In summary , the carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives because the sense of responsibility to inform the relatives with crucial genetic information outweighs concern about affecting the individual by imparting "bad" or potentially unwelcome news .
Potential harm to uninformed family relatives has to be considered although the disclosure may not be smooth due to lack of understanding by relatives .
Fortunately the latter can be solved by seeking the help of genetic health professionals who can provide effective communication strategies to help produce a positive outcome of communication .

Gene is the basic heredity unit in all living organism its properties concerns families and kinship of all humans .
It is the study of how characteristics are passed down through generations .
The ability to identify more genes which are related to specific disorders increases dramatically as the genetic technology develops vigorously in this modern time .
It allows new possibilities of genetic testing and more to come (Clarke & Parsons , 1997) .
In the case of diseases that have an onset in adulthood , such as Huntington's disease , people can get themselves tested before symptoms develop to discover the likelihood of getting the disorder .
Some of those who receive positive testing result , despite the shock and the devastating situation that they face , will consider the interests of other family members and inform their relatives of the existence of this genetic risk in the family .
But not all patients will have the moral obligation to do .
Thus , there is a need for carrier of a known genetic risk to be legally obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Carriers of known genetic risks should be obligated to tell their relatives because it prevents severe harm such as loss of lives .
If they are being alerted of such condition , they will be able to seek possible treatments and receive warnings to avoid detrimental environment stimuli .
For example , malignant hyperthermia syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder where life-threatening condition will be triggered by regular anesthesia .
Prior warning of a carrier can actually prevent unexpected death of blood relatives during their surgeries (Andrews , 1994) .
Moreover , information of genetic risk from a carrier will serve as guidance in his or her relatives' reproductive decision makings .
After knowing of possible genetic condition , one may think twice before deciding to conceive a child .
The rate of abortion upon learning of fetus defection will then decrease , hence preventing meaningless loss of lives .
Likewise , obligation of carrier to tell his or her relatives allows those who indeed will suffer from dormant genetic diseases or are suffering from genetic condition to plan their lives ahead .
They will tend to avoid passing on the undesirable condition to their children , hence they may seek proper guidance through counseling before consider to conceive a child .
For example , Huntington's disease's symptoms normally only appear when one is approaching his or her middle age .
Knowing of this dormant genetic disease earlier certainly allows the patients to make decision whether to build a family or not to , or for those who already have their own families - whether to conceive children or not to because there is a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to the offspring for each pregnancy .
In addition , informed relatives who then find out their genetic condition - whether they are a carrier or sufferer of that particular genetic disease or not , are given a chance to secure financial schemes for future use .
Furthermore , their family members are granted the time to equip themselves with the knowledge and ability to take care of said patients for an extended period of time in future .
Undoubtedly , privacy advocates criticizes that such enforced obligation violates an individual's autonomy .
They argue that for family interest to outweigh one's autonomy is unethical because there may be cases where relatives use one's genetic disorder information to their own advantages , rendering said individual to material loss and mishap social status .
For example , a woman can easily claim custody of her children from her formal husband who has Huntington's disease , by asserting he will not have the ability to take care of their children in near future .
While it is true that the extreme circumstances mentioned do exist in the society , one must agree that relatives have their reserved rights too , to know about the presence of genetic risk within the family because no one has exclusive rights over his or her genes as they are shared among the family .
Spouses too have the rights to know when it comes to making a family just as he or she has equal rights over the children .
Indeed , powerful protection has always been given to autonomy , privacy and confidentiality .
However , these ethics can be breached when the action has an essential purpose , such as safeguarding others from harm , which unquestionably outweighs those said principles (Andrews , 1994) .
The absolute priority that they possess should be balanced by awareness of averting medical harm to fellow humans (Wang , 2001) .
Therefore , carrier of known genetic risk should be legally obligated to inform relatives , not just morally responsible to do that .
In conclusion , legal obligation of carriers with known genetic risk to tell their relatives should be implemented as it bring about advantages such as preventing loss of lives and reducing uncertainties in potential patients' futures .
Firstly , based on the context of confidentiality and privacy , individuals' right to privacy ought to maintain confidentiality of the genetic makeup .
If one has no control over who can gain information of the individual , it can lead to potentially serious consequences .
Byravan ,S .
and Matlaw ,J(2005) emphasized that individual genetic information gained from testing should be subjected to confidentiality and protected from harm that might result from improper disclosure or use of the information .
One may perceive privacy as an overrated right . . .
Thirdly , upon providing genetic material , individuals lose control over who can access results .
Consequently , when someone shows the predisposition to genetic disorder , it exposes one to the possibility of stigmatisation and discrimination when the genetic information is made accessible to others .
Byravan .S and Matlaw .J (2005) highlighted that the cost-conscious employers might make adverse employment decisions based on a person's predispositions .
They might also be turned down job promotions .
Due to profit-wise considerations , one's privilege to different schemes of insurance converge might be limited .
One might even be excluded from health insurance coverage when one's gene status shows flaw .
As such , the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) is implemented to prevent health insurers and employers to discriminate against a person's genetic predispositions (Allison , 2008) .
One may argue that following the safeguards established , it should be able to hinder away the needless worries .
However , Norrgard ,K (2008) pointed out that current regulations lack adequate enforcement mechanism .
Assurances of protection is more difficult to come by , after all , the decisions made are still largely dependent on the subjective perception of the society .
In conclusion , the decision of examinee to have their results of genetic testing disclosed or to refuse them should be voluntary and should not be interfered with .
The loss of privacy and the potential social discrimination involved are still the main concerns of the public .
Genetic information should be disclosed without the patient's authorization only when necessary to protect third parties from harm or when disclosure is compelled by law . . . . .
There has been an ongoing debate on whether doctors should reveal the results of genetic tests to others besides the individuals who have underwent the tests without their acknowledgement (Lynch , 2008) , (Ostrom , 1997) and (Tanner , 2004) .
Genetic testing can confirm one's ancestry , paternity and the risk of them developing a disease or passing on the genetic disease to their offspring (Lynch , 2008) .
It would benefit others , as relatives of the individual known to be a carrier of the disease might be at-risk of developing the disease as well (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center , 2004) .
Conversely , some people feel that it is an invasion of privacy (Tanner , 2004) and that others may abuse the information (Ostrom , 1997) .
Discrimination may also occur (The Associated Press , 2008) and insurance premiums for individuals and their relatives might increase if insurance companies know that the have a high risk of developing certain hereditary diseases .
Hence individuals should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of their genetic tests to their relatives .
It is without a doubt beneficial to inform relatives that they might be at risk of developing a hereditary disease when individual's genetic tests turn out to be positive (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center , 2004) .
Relatives may choose to go for a genetic test to determine their status by checking for the particular mutation known to increase the risk of developing a particular disease (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center , 2004) .
Should they test positive for the particular mutation , preventive measures and cost-effective treatments could be carried out to reduce the risk of developing the disease (The Changes in Health Care Financing and Organization (HCFO) , 2005) but not every person with the mutation would develop the disease eventually .
On the flipside , some people cannot come to terms with the fact that they might have a higher chance of developing a disease compared to other people .
They might have very negative thoughts like anger , fear that they would develop the disease in the near future or if they have children , they might feel guilty about passing the mutation to their children (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center , 2004) .
Hence , individuals should have the final decision on whether they want to reveal the results of their genetic test to their relatives , especially if they know that their relatives would be unable to cope with the news .
Another issue now is that individual's privacy is not respected as insurance companies without their consent show their results to relatives .
Insurance companies might have gotten hold of individual's positive genetic tests without their consent to show their relatives why their insurance premiums were jerked up (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center , 2004) or to explain why their bid to get insured was rejected (Ostrom , 1997) .
Then again , if relatives know that a genetic disease is hereditary and went for a genetic test to prove that they do not have the mutation that would put them at a higher risk of developing the disease , they would be able to get insured earlier (Ostrom , 1997) .
Although there are regulations to prevent insurers from discriminating people with a higher chance of getting certain genetic diseases The Changes in Health Care Financing and Organization (HCFO) , 2005) , it might lead to higher insurance premium for everyone .
Hence , the results of individual's genetic test should not be revealed to others unless individuals choose to as the information could be abused and their relatives would most likely be affected .
In conclusion , I believe that the privacy of individuals should be respected .
This is because the emotional stability of the relatives in question has to be taken into consideration , as not every person in the family would develop the disease even if there have a particular mutation that puts them at a higher risk of developing the disease .
Also , relatives might be discriminated besides individuals should others like insurance companies know that the disease is hereditary .
Hence , it should be up to individuals to disclose the results of the genetic tests to their relatives if they choose to .

The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
Genetic testing is a specific medical test to look out for a particular part of the genes .
It is often used to diagnose inherited diseases and to determine a child's genetic parents .
With the main focus on fine tuning its processes to increase its accuracy , ethical issues have not been well addressed .
Ethical issue such as whether an individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in revealing the results remains shady .
Many argue that they should not have the final say as it benefits the general public as a whole .
In fact , by knowing the results , it might create unnecessary fear among people .
Not only that , the society might in turn discriminate the individual with an undesired result .
Furthermore , it is morally wrong to reveal the results without the individual's consent as it intrudes one's privacy .
Therefore , individuals should have the final say in revealing the results of their genetic test .
First and foremost , revealing the genetic test results without one's consent is an invasion of privacy .
Some might argue that the results benefit the whole population as it might be useful an already statistically- scarce medical research .
However , it is disrespectful to the individual since it is the individual who decides to undertake this genetic test in the first place .
Moreover , having the final say in disclosing the results does not mean not revealing the results at all .
One may initially find it hard to accept the reality and may decide to reveal the results at a later stage when ready .
In this case , that individual still can aid in the medical research .
Secondly , by revealing the results without the individual's final say might cause unnecessary stress to others especially to their relatives .
An individual might chose not to reveal the outcome of the test as it might create anxiety on their loved ones .
This in turn would create unnecessary stress and might affect the way they lead their lives .
With this , some might argue that this will impose more strain on the individual who is already facing the stress from reality , and therefore , revealing the results might unburden him or her .
However , there are genetic counselors trained in this field to address any concerns , and thus there is no need to reveal the results without the individual's final say .
Thirdly , by knowing the results of the genetic test on the individuals might cause discriminations against them .
As our genes are not controlled by us , it will be unfair to discriminate individuals based on their genetic makeup (Norrgard , 2008) .
For example , a 30 year old employee who is as competent as any other staff , was recently genetically tested positive for Huntington's disease .
Individuals with Huntington's disease develop their symptoms such as uncontrolled movements and mental declination only at an average age of 35-44 years old .
Knowing that the employee could not remain committed to the company in the next 5-10 years , the employer decides to retrench that employee .
As such , the employee's potential will be hindered as he or she would still be able to work normally until the symptoms set in 5-10 years from now .
This not only hinder one's potential , it will also affect the way the individual walk his or her remaining path of life .
Similarly , a health insurance company might deny an individual from having an insurance plan or might charge them at a higher rate if such results are disclosed to them .
Some might argue that this is necessary to prevent people from benefitting off from those insurance companies .
However , we must not forget the fact that we have no control on our genetic make-up .
As such it is not because that they want to benefit off from these companies , it is more of what they have to do in order to survive financially .
Besides , the very purpose of health insurance companies is to provide healthcare and to ensure the well-being of the people .
As important as it is to increase the accuracy of genetic testing , individuals should have the final say in revealing the results .
By doing so , we can respect each other's privacy , minimize unnecessary stress on others as well as to eliminate discrimination against the already unfortunate individuals .
Genetic testing is a technique used to test for genetic disorder .
In genetic testing , patient's DNA is being tested for mutation and patient's DNA is obtained from his/her blood sample .
Reasons why people should go for genetic testing are to find out genetic diseases in babies and to find out whether a person carry a mutated gene might pass it on to their children .
Although some may argue that a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives about it , due to privacy concern issue , different emotional reactions of relatives or parents .
Therefore , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Firstly , revealing of genetic testing results raises an issue of privacy concern .
This is because there is a possibility that those individuals who have the likelihood of developing cancer or diseases are being backstabbed by someone they know .
Individuals who found out that their genes were mutated have an increase risk in developing cancer or diseases .
For example , an employer would not want to retain or hire employees that have a likelihood of developing cancer or diseases as employees' health and working ability will be affected once they develop cancer .
Similarly , individuals who have the likelihood of developing cancer or diseases will have difficulties in obtaining insurances as individuals are likely to increase medical bills once they develop cancer or diseases .
Costs of their bills will be very high for insurance company .
Furthermore , it is unfair to discriminate individuals who have the likelihood of developing cancer or diseases as they themselves cannot control their own genes .
(Norrgard , 2008)
There is an argument stating that revealing of individuals' genetic test result will benefit individuals' relative or parents .
This is because individuals' relative or parents can go for genetic testing and check whether they had inherited any mutated gene(s) or not .
If individuals' relative or parents had inherited any mutated gene(s) , they can undergo preventive health measures .
Although revealing of individuals' genetic test result will benefit individuals' relative or parents , not much preventive measures can be done to delay or lower the risk of individuals' relative or parents from developing cancer or diseases .
Therefore , there is not a need to reveal individuals' genetic test result as individuals can ask their parents or relative to undergo genetic testing without revealing their result .
(Lee , 2005)
In conclusion , revealing of genetic testing results will affect individuals .
Therefore , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives due to privacy concern issue , negative emotional reactions of relatives or parents .
The human genome project began in 1990 , was an ambitious project with the aim of sequencing the 3 billion human DNA and identifying the genes present in these DNA .1 It is no doubt that this project is one of the most successful achievements in the field of biotechnology .
The information gathered enables one to know how the genetic makeup of human correlate to a particular cause of disease .1 However the availability of such test has brought about other ethical issues like , should the results be announced to the carrier of known genetic risk to his relatives .
I believe this is an issue of personal privacy and rights , the carrier should not have any obligation to inform anyone unless he wishes to do so .
A Carrier With a Known Genetic Risk Should Tell His or Her Relatives
Genetic testing is a testing that can check some genetic disorder or disease such as {Hemophilia}[HYPERLINK: http://en .wikipedia .org/wiki/Hemophilia] , Huntington's disease and Marfan Syndrome , which means that this kind of disease has certain possibility to be inherited to the next generation .
There is controversy whether a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Considering the preparation for the future of his or her relatives , the carrier should tell his or her relatives about the disease or disorder .
Firstly , it is a general knowledge that until present , all kinds of genetic disease have no definite cure .
It seems to be doing no benefit by revealing the existence of the genetic disease to the carrier's relatives .
However , it can raise the awareness of the carrier's relatives when they plan to give birth to the next generation .
If they know that their family tends to have such disease , they can have another genetic testing to verify their own condition .
This can actually prevent an unfortunate baby that would affect their entire life to be born .
Somehow , privacy is what people concern of the most when discussing this topic .
I could not agree more with the fact that the carrier's privacy is sacrificed when he or she reveal off the testing result .
Nevertheless , family members should have the right to know the genetic information as they are genetically related to each other , which means that they are in the same risk also .
Therefore , the result of the testing should be told to the carrier's relatives .
In conclusion , the carrier should be obligated to tell his or her relatives the result of genetic testing their benefit and of course the carrier's own benefit .
Respond to the question above , supporting your argument with concrete examples .
Genetic testing is a type of medical test that is used to find changes in genes , chromosomes and protein (Genetic Home Reference , 2009) .
It has been used for years to identify genetic diseases in humans .
When the result of the test is positive , once who have a genetic risk will receive appropriate treatments .
However , whether a carrier of such disease is obligated to tell his or her relatives has become a great concern since a last few years .
Although it is the right of the individual requesting genetic to decide to reveal the result or not (Scientific American , 2008) , relatives of a carrier also have the right to be warned against any genetic risk and to received necessary treatment .
Genetic disorders are caused by the mutation of a gene (Letsou , 2009)  .When a normal gene is mutated , its stability will no longer be maintained .
This will lead to some diseases , depends on which gene is mutated .
Since disorders can be passed over from parents to a child , the relatives of a carrier , obviously , have a higher chance to carry the same disorder .
Thus , they should be informed about the risk of having disorders .
Being aware of it , they may choose to go through some genetic tests to check whether the disorder presents (Scientific American , 2008) .
If the result is positive , then they will receive necessary treatments .
Although we haven't found how to cure many of such diseases yet , if it is detected soon , the life of the patient can be lengthened .
Some people can claim that knowing that we are having a high risk of having , for example , a type of cancer while we may not have it can make people more anxious (Cancer .net , 2009)  .
In fact , the reactions of people with disorders are different (Cancer .net , 2009) thus we may not be diagnosed to have a cancer since we were young but it may present when we are at the middle age .
Knowing more about a risk of having a disease may help people to be more aware of its phenomenon , as well as more concern on their health (Cancer .net , 2009) .
They may have medical check-up more frequently and if there is any disorder that can threaten their life , it will be identified soon and it is always better when we can control a disease when it hasn't become worse .
At least the effect of the disorder can be reduced .
This may lengthen the life of the carrier or even more , save it .

Since the relatives of a carrier of disorders , especially his or her family , have a higher risk , they have a right to know about it (Cancer .net , 2009) .
This will protect not only the relatives but also other people .
It is because genetic disorder not only affect the health of carriers but also their life .
For example , a person who is diagnosed to have a serious disorder in a gene , which may lead to a rare disease , will have to think very carefully before getting married since his or her children can also have this disease also .
Moreover , genetic disorders usually have a great influence in carrier's health .
It may decrease the working capability of the carrier , or some hidden disease can become worse if the carrier works too much , or lives in an extremely polluted place .
While children whose parents are diagnosed to have a genetic disease can very possibly to have it(Genetic Home Reference , 2009) , they should be inform so that I can make suitable decision in choosing job , participating in hard activities and so on .
Many genetic disorders such as cancers will lead to serious consequences if the carrier does not have a healthy lifestyle to protect himself .
Otherwise since the disorder is not serious , then the carrier can live a normal life .
Although there is a concern that a positive test with a particular genetic disease can decrease the chance of the candidate in getting a job (Fisher , 2009) since companies always want employees that can work as hard as they want , laws are passed in order to protect the victims of disorder(Fisher , 2009) .
Furthermore , whenever a person received a positive test on a particular genetic disorder , he will choose the job that can not destroy his health or make the disorder worse .
Moreover , carriers of disorders can receive supports from their relatives , especially from their family if they let them know about the diagnosis .
When a teenager is diagnosed to have a serious genetic disorder , she must tell her parents , since the doctor need the permission of her family before giving her any treatment .
It is said that parents may feel guilty because their may pass dangerous disorder over their children (Cancer , 2009) .
However , when a carrier's family know well about her health condition , she will receive more care , which is better for her in keeping her health in a good condition .
Furthermore , telling relatives the results also help the carriers .
They will receive more encouragement , as well as other helps in money , medicine and so on (Croft , 2009) .
This makes carriers feel better even if the disease is serious , thus they have an internal strength to struggle with it .
Hence also help to increase the success rate of the treatment because when the patients really think of overcoming the disease , the process will go easily .
In conclusion ,because it is a right of humans to know about the risk they are having , the carriers of disorders must tell his or her relatives about it .
It not only protects their relatives but also help them in fighting the diseases .

"The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing ."
Over the years , genetic testing has been increasing used in clarifying a diagnosis for more targeted treatments and allowing families to avoid having children with devastating diseases .
However , may also be a precarious tool capable of invading an individual's privacy and breaching confidentiality , thus , having a significantly negative impact on future public health .
In addition , abuse of genetic testing information may result in employment discrimination .
Therefore , individual should have the final say whether to reveal the results of their own genetic testing .
Firstly , privacy is important in maintaining individuals' autonomy and individuality as individuals define themselves by deciding how much personal information to disclose (Privacilla , 2001) .
Similarly , privacy also relates to the individuals' power over genetic information confidentiality .
Moreover , genetic information is protected in several ways; Common Law Principles , Statutory protection in the Data Protect Act 1984 , Doctor's professional codes of practice and contracts of healthcare providers' employment .
According to these documents , anyone including all healthcare providers has no right to disclose individuals' genetic information to a third party without the individual's consent .
However , genetic information of an individual susceptible to a particular genetic disease inevitably concerns family members who usually also share the same set of genes .
Hence , advocates may argue that if an individual holds the final say , yet chooses to withhold the information from their family members , this could have serious implications on the other family members susceptible to a particular disease .
On the other hand , if the individual chooses to freely release such information to family members who may not be susceptible , could cause undue anxiety .
Admittedly , the imbalance control can result in negative consequences , but one can also adopt the view that a responsible person would wish to communicate relevant information to their family members who are interested in that information , and a responsible person is interested in that information , particularly where it may have a significance in future decisions that they might hold .
Supporting this notion , evidences from a government case study suggests that individual withholding genetic information from people , who may need to know , is not a common occurrence .
In addition , desirability of sharing information with family members is also emphasized through counseling and doctor's persuading , but not made a condition as it does not supersede the individual's right to privacy .
Furthermore , it is false that family members are not protected , because the court passes on laws to reveal an individuals' genetic information .
This however , is judged on a case by case basis , and is only approved if an individual's decision causes potential damage rather than mere inconvenience and if the reason for refusal to give permission has evidences of malice .
Most importantly , confidence and trust can also be shattered if doctors fail to respect confidentiality .
In the long run , public health might be affected as doctors are discredited as a source of education and patients do not come forward .
Therefore , individual should still have the final say because the interest of the family members does not supersede individuals' privacy and there is an assumed responsibility of individual to share relevant information , but even without doing so , family members would still be protected by the laws .
Also , breaching patients' confidentiality has significantly negative impact on future public health .
Secondly , the disclosure of individuals' genetic information to employers may result in employment discrimination .
Competition in market forces and drive for economic efficiency can invoke employers to exploit the genetic information as opportunities to reduce cost and improve work efficiency .
Employers would prefer to hire a "healthy worker" because they have a lower frequency of being absent through illness which translates to lower cost in work impairments , hiring temporary replacements and fewer precautions to be taken to deal with health and safety risks .
Moreover , genetic information can also deny a person with late onset of the disease of a particular job , for example a person with Huntington's disease , being healthy most of his or her life time .
Though some employers claimed that knowing individuals' genetic information can help them to take specific measures to protect individuals at risk of occupational diseases , it might not be feasible to the financial status of a company if such measures were to incur huge sums of money .
The overriding truth is that employers would inevitably be more concerned about the company's profitability .
In fact , disclosure of genetic information has no benefits to people at risk of non- occupational diseases , but serves to reduce their chances of employment .
Moreover , there is currently no legal protection against genetic discrimination in most parts of the world .
Therefore , individual should still hold the right and freedom to the final say because of possible employment discrimination as they have no legal protections .
In conclusion , individual should have the final say in revealing their own genetic testing results .
It is an assumed that individuals should be responsible in sharing relevant information with their family member after counseling .
However , if their actions can result in a direct effect or harm on a third party the court may pass on laws to override such privacy .
Disclosure of genetic information can discredit doctors as a source of education and may deteriorate the public health system .
Also , individual is susceptible to possible employment discrimination as currently they have no legal protections .

Firstly , individuals might not be ready to disclose their genetic testing results to their family members as they feel that their privacy is invaded (A .M , 2009) .
They are still not mentally prepared to disclose the information as they think that they might get discriminated by their relatives .
For example , a person who has a risk of getting an inherited disease might not be able to inherit his family business for fear that he will not be able to withstand the tough job requirements .
Hence , if they are not mentally and emotionally prepared to disclose such information , they should be given the right of not telling their relatives about it .
However , critics argue that there are counseling sessions set up to help individuals understand their personal risk or the risk for other family members (Adams , 2003) .
Seeking third parties' opinion is not very useful as they might not fully understand the situation that individuals are in and often , they make wrong judgments .
Hence , a carrier of a known genetic disease should not be obligated to tell his relatives due to invasion of privacy .
Secondly , individuals have the desire to protect family members from troubling information .
This is because not everyone in the family will get the disease and disclosing such information to family members might cause unnecessary anxiety in the family .
For example , a parent might not want to tell their children that she has a certain inherited disease as she is guilty about passing the mutated genes to her children .
However , critics argue that family members should have the right to know if they are at risk of getting the disease .
Since they are in the same family tree , the relatives should have the right to know the probability of contracting this inherited disease .
This helps them to make informed choices about their health and maybe seek treatment before the disease bloom .
Nonetheless , disclosure to family members may not respect their right of not to know .
The carrier's family members might not want to know about the genetic risk and hence , disclosing such information might cause them to be anxious and panicky .
These are unnecessary since the probability of getting the inherited disease given that a family member has the disease is relatively low .
This is because one might not get the mutated genes .
Hence , genetic testing results should not be known to the family members to protect them .
Lastly , letting third parties such as relatives know about the genetic testing results may post strains in family relationships .
Genetic testing creates tension within the family because the results can reveal information about other family members in addition to the person who is tested (What are the risks and limitations of genetic testing , 2009) .
This means that personal health information is known to everyone in the family tree including those relatives that one is not close to .
Hence , one might not feel secured to disclose their genetic testing results to their family members .
Admittedly , letting family members know about the genetic risk might cause families to be even more united and they will have a better understanding about their inherited genes .
However , this is only the minority .
Majority of the people are still discriminated by their family members as relatives would look at them from a different angle .
Hence , genetic testing results should not be known to the family members to prevent relationships from turning sour .
In conclusion , genetic testing results should not be made known to third parties such as family members .
Although many people may say that these results should be made known to family members to inform them about the chances of contracting the inherited disease , problems like invasion of privacy , protecting family members from troubling information as well as posting strains in family relationships still outweigh the benefits .
Hence , I disagree that a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell their relatives .
Genetic testing is a scientific process that studies changes in chromosomes , genes or proteins .
In order to confirm or rule out a suspected genetic condition or determine a person's chance of developing or passing on a genetic disorder depends on the results of the genetic test .
As there are ethical , legal and social concerns with revealing the results of such testing , the decision lies in the carrier of the known genetic risk .
Thus , the individual should not be obligated to tell his relatives .
Firstly , one of the implications in revealing the results to our relatives is the threat of facing genetic discrimination when the information is leaked out (Norrgard , 2008) .
Employers and insurance companies may make use of the information about genetic tests while ignoring the issue of privacy and confidentiality .
For example , if an employer discovers that the chance that an employee is diagnosed with Huntington's disease is high , the employer may not retain the employee .
As a result , individuals may be discriminated against by employers or be denied needed and deserved insurance coverage .
This is extremely unfair to an individual by discriminating against his genetic predispositions because we cannot control our genes .
Hence , the carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to inform his relatives for fear of information being leaked out , which can lead to potential discrimination .
Secondly , an implication in revealing the results leads to the threat of eugenics (Devore , 1992) .
Childbearing decisions are based on genetic information , thus adding social or political pressure on people .
Reproduction is encouraged between those presumed to have inheritable desirable traits while those have genetic defects are discouraged to reproduce .
For example , if you discovered that you had inherited the Huntington's disease mutation , you would decide not to have children of your own so as not to risk passing the gene on to your children .
In addition , relatives may encourage women carrying foetuses with genetic abnormalities to go for abortion .
Thus , these women may develop feelings of guilt and depression and affect their well-being .
Therefore , the carrier should not be obligated to tell our relatives about the genetic risk .
Lastly , it is a violation of basic human rights when the carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to inform his relatives (Jones , 2005) .
The individual has privacy right to decide if he wants others to know of his genetic condition .
For example , if the individual feels that he will be strongly stigmatized and marginalized or once his relatives know of his genetic condition , they will treat him differently or abandon him as he is "tarnished" by a deadly gene , he may not want his relatives to know of his genetic condition , for fear of information being circulated .
In other words , by making it an obligation to inform his relatives , it is an intrusion of his right to privacy .
On the other hand , critics argue that by revealing results of the carrier of known genetic risk to his relatives , this will benefit the relatives' health and well-being greatly .
Preventive measures can be taken before symptoms of the inherited disorder develop (Lee , 2005) .
However , this is based on the assumption that people are optimistic and they will undergo treatments upon knowing that the disorder is treatable .
But what about disorders for which no preventive measures or treatments are available ?
Most people will despair and are reluctant to undergo treatments .
Moreover , some people tend to worry too much about their genetic disorder and this may ultimately lead to depression .
After all , revealing the results to his relatives may not be useful .
In addition , some critics argue that revealing results to relatives will help them to make informed choices about their future .
For example , if the carrier of a known genetic risk has borne the burden of having a strong family history of genetic disorder for years may feel relieved when he receives a positive test result .
By revealing the results to his relatives , they no longer have to live with uncertainty about their future and their children's future .
In this way , they can plan for their future and for those couples who want to have children of their own may think twice (Lee , 2005) .
However , I beg to differ .
By revealing results to relatives , those with children may feel a sense of guilt as they are worried that they could have pass the genetic disorder to their children .
Thus , this adds stress to the relatives and is not beneficial by revealing the results .
In conclusion , the carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives as this is an intrusion of privacy and they will be faced with the threats of genetic discrimination and eugenics .
By revealing the results , these implications greatly outweigh the benefit of improving health and well-being of others .
The individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing
Over recent years , genetic tests have grown in number , accuracy and availability .
They have been touted by many as the first step in the dawning of a new age of diagnostic and curative medicine , a step on the road to widespread and effective gene therapy for a large number of conditions (Victorian , 2009) .
It has also brought about some ethical and moral issues surrounding it .
Some people state that the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
But actually , they have spoken too high of the human rationality .
Here , I disagree with these people and want to assert that individual should not have the right to reveal the result .
And my stand is based on two reasons: 1 .
Genetic testing would bring negative psychological effects to other people who may not want to know the results; 2 .The revealing of the results would cause discrimination and unfairness in the society .
As you can see , for disorders that are preventable or treatable , most people agree that genetic testing makes sense .
But for diseases with no preventative measures , would you want to know if you were affected or not ?
Many adult-onset genetic disorders are progressive and have long-term health consequences .
Thus , when a person is at risk for such a disorder , he or she may consider undergoing genetic testing .
When the consequences of the specific disorder in question are treatable , most people would agree that genetic testing makes sense .
But what about disorders for which no preventative measures or treatments are available ?
Just like the Huntington's Disease , there is currently no treatment for this disease , nor is there anything an affected person can do to prevent the inevitable onset of symptoms (Scitable , 2009) .
Once you got some negative information about your genes as regards to these kinds of incurable diseases , the only thing you can do is just wait to die .
During the rest of your life , you would really suffer a lot , not only physically , but also mentally .
You tend to be desperate about your life .
And you will be a buffer of both your family and the society .
Furthermore , once you know that you are a carrier of the negative genes , you tend to worry about your descendants .
There is a great chance that they are also carriers of these kinds of negative genes .
Then you would feel guilty about this and fall into a deep depression .
So individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing since it would cause serious psychological effect on people who do not want to know the results .
On a larger scale , the negative psychological effect brought by the genetic testing
would be the discrimination in the society .
This kind of discrimination mainly regards to the unfairness on insurance coverage and employment .
For the insurance companies , in order to avoid bankrupt , they would reduce or just cancel their coverage on the genetic problems .
For the employment institutions , in order to keep high efficiencies on the output , they would reject employees with genetic problems .
And for a normal society , that would be quite unfair .
Arguments proposed by people who stand up to the point that individuals deserve the right to stimulate the genetic info are faulty .
For instance , they might argue that people should have the right or the freedom to control their privacy such as the genetic testing results .
But as we can see , the freedom is not an absolute item .
If there is a great probability that freedom does harm to the society , it should definitely be banned .
Also people might argue that for disorders in genes that are preventable or treatable , it will be good for individuals to have access to their genetic info .
But these people put too much belief on the genetic technology .
In fact , most genetic problems are untreatable .
Once people get this kind of problems , the only thing they can do is wait to die .
Thirdly , people may also argue that , for a society , in order to obtain the optimal benefits , it has to reject people who get genetic problems .
But this will definitely arouse serious moral problems in the society , which would buffer the development of the society .
In conclusion , individuals should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing since that would bring about serious problems , such as individual depression and social discrimination .
Genetic testing is a technology which screens and examines the genes of a person to check whether he has a specific genetic disorders or diseases which are not able to be detected using common medical procedures .
This technology is one of modern technologies and has many effects in human life .
Genetic testing gives information for people to know their health conditions but this testing raises concerns about the ethical and psychological issues whether an individual taking the genetic testing must reveal the result to third parties such as family , employers and friends because the result can be stressful .
However , I agree that one must not disclose the result because the result not only concerns the individual life but also his family .
First , the result affects the future of one family as the genetic disorder can be inherited to the next generation and in event that some members of the family have this genetic disorder too .
One has to reveal the result to one's family and spouse for them to know .
Therefore , the family can discuss and find the best solution for this matter .
After knowing the result , a couple should find ways to treat the disease before they are giving birth to a child because the child has big possibility to have the gene which is dangerous for the future of the child (Otto 2007) .
The parents can initially prepare the right treatment and provide proper diets for their infants .
Moreover , some of these genetic diseases are contagious and this endangers the whole family and the people around the one who has the disease .
In a worse case , if some members of a family have these genetic diseases , they should find solutions or treatments to cure them or at least prevent the disease to spread .
These cases assure one should reveal the result to one's family .
Third , the test result has great effect in one's career life and one is obliged to tell the employer about the result .
Many employers want to know the health condition of their workers because they do not want to have a disease spread over places in their offices and they want to ensure the safety of their workers .
By knowing that a worker has genetic disorder , the employer will provide the worker another job which has less contact with other workers or which has the most suitable environment condition for the worker .
For example , for a worker who has genetic disorder on his skins should not work in an area that has radiation .
Otto (2007) notes that many employers have obliged people to take genetic testing first before they are hired .
Some argue that a genetic elimination in choosing worker is discrimination because this is an action of limiting one's right to work (Andre and Velasquez 2009) .
However , the genetic testing is to ensure the safety of all workers .
The worker who has genes disease can be not ne hired but this for the life of people around him .
The decision to undergo genetic testing can only be made by the individual at risk for a disorder .
Once a test has been conducted and the results are known , however , a new family related ethical dilemma is born: Should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?
Respond to the question above , supporting your argument with concrete examples .
By being able to make decisions to undergo genetic testing , individuals here refers to mature and thinking people .
Since genetic testing is to determine if a person has genetic disorder (Goh , 2003) , people usually undergo such test because they are at risk for a disorder .
Family medical history , onset of symptoms and an increasing number of people in the community being confirmed of it are the reasons that lead to an individual being deemed at risk .
In considering these three factors , I feel that a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to reveal the results to his or her relatives .
Firstly , if the risk is due to family medical history such as haemophilia and Huntington's disease (NIH) , then by revealing it to relatives , more people will know that they could be at risk too .
Being aware of the likelihood of having of having such disorder , more people will seek for confirmation through testing as well .
Thus , when a carrier of a known genetic risk discloses the results with his or her relatives , more people will be able to take precautionary measures if tested positive .
Disorders like haemophilia and Huntington's disease are dangerous if attention is not paid to them .
Moreover , relatives will then know what is suitable for the carrier and provide appropriate care and concern .
Although many believe that admitting to a disorder will give rise to discrimination and strained relationship , they failed to consider that relatives appreciate the trust .
The return care and concern from them will further improve their kinship .
The second type of disorder is the multifactorial and polygenic disorder .
Genes inherited play a role in such a disorder too but lifestyle and the environment are influential factors as well (Richard , 2003) .
Heart diseases and diabetes are categorised under this type of disorder .
Again , disorders of such type puts lives at stake and therefore carriers should be obligated to convey the results of the genetic test to his relatives .
The last type of genetic disorder can be hereditary but ironically , it can also not be .
When the number of people in the community getting a similar disorder is increasing , a person can be at risk too .
The classic example of this kind of disorder is the sickle-cell anaemia .
It is a disorder whereby the red blood cells of the carrier change their shape from round to sickle shape (William , 2006) .
This is especially obvious in places where malaria is prevalent .
Their genes mutated to adapt to the environment better .
It was thought that such disorder is a response by the body to adapt to the environment because carrier will be immune to malaria .
However , sickle-cell anaemia causes shorter life expectancy and intermittent pain (William , 2006) .
If carriers are responsible and share their testing results , people can come together to weed out the problem by say eradicating malaria .
In this way , less people will suffer .
To conclude , we have seen that disclosure of test results to a carrier's relatives is outright compulsory .
This obligation will save lives and better the living environment and lifestyle of many people .
We should be responsible and with these values and beliefs , there is no dilemma because subjecting to discrimination and other social problems are insignificant when compared to matters of live and death and health of the general public .

Rapid development in genetic field has made genetic testing a potential method to be used in healthcare improvement .
Genetic testing is carried out mainly for diagnosis confirmation , prediction for heritable-disorder diseases and to identify carrier of disorder without physical symptom (National Human Genome Institute , 2008) .
Sharing of test positive result with relatives is necessary as it is the relatives' rights to know about it .
It also alerts them for early detection and treatment .
Indirectly , it could help in medical research development and make treatment for currently untreatable disease possible .
Hence , a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Firstly , genetic information could be extremely personal to an individual (Canadian Cystic Fibrosis foundation , 2000) .
Confidentiality of such information should be protected so that one's privacy could be respected .
However , genetic information comes in two kinds .
The first one is the mutation in a family while the latter is one's own genetic status .
(Skene , n .d .) .
It is alright for not sharing own's genetic status but sharing of mutation in family with blood relatives is essential as it affects the blood relatives as well .
He or she has the rights to know about it .
Moreover , best clinical practice required family history to assess the usefulness of genetic testing (Parker and Lucassen , n .d .) .
Hence , there is no reason why one could benefit from the family history but omitted the relatives' rights to have such benefits as well .
Genetic discrimination by health insurers and employers could be one of the main hinders that stop people from sharing their genetic information with blood relatives (National Human Genome Institute , 2008) .
This could be protected once President Bush had signed the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (The white House , 2008) .

Lastly , revealing the positive test result might increase the number of people going for genetic testing .
This indirectly increase the possibility of people signing consent to take part in the research for the genetic related disease .
With such , improved or new treatment is possible for genetic related diseases and could possibly benefit the carrier or even the family members .
In conclusion , revealing of genetic information to the relatives did not seem to be of great disadvantages to an individual but could be of great advantages to the blood relatives .
Besides the rights to know , most importantly is the possibility of early detection and treatment for the blood relatives .
Development of new treatment for currently untreatable diseases is also possible .
Therefore a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives .

Genetic testing is not a new term in this modern era .
People can predict the probability of developing some genetic diseases with this technological advancement .
({http://ghr .nlm .nih .gov/handbook/testing/genetictesting}[HYPERLINK: http://ghr .nlm .nih .gov/handbook/testing/genetictesting])This is undoubtedly contribute to the prevention of treatable diseases .
However , it would appear that patients are not the only people who are interested in the outcome of the testing .
Many third parties also show a great interest in the result especially the patient's family members .
Family members have to know the result so that they can receive early treatment and have early financial and psychological preparation .
Thus , I strongly agree that a carrier of a known disease risk be obligated to inform his or her relatives .
Firstly , the patients are obligated to tell their relatives about the result as the result will invariably affect them to some extent .
For example , if the result showed that the patient is a carrier of a genetic disease , there is a great possibility that the family members are also have the same disease .
So it is crucial to let the family members know the results so that they can receive treatment earlier .
Permanent and irreversible damages can be prevented if treatment or therapy is initiated in the early stage of the disease .
(http://www .ndsu .nodak .edu/instruct/m cclean/plsc431/students98/saha .htm)Patients would sometimes choose not to reveal the result to avoid discrimination among family members .
However , saving the family members lives is more important if compare to self-esteem .
Secondly , patients are responsible to tell their relatives especially the family members about the outcome of genetic test so that they can have early financial and psychological preparations .
Treatments for diseases are always costly .
Family members have to plan their budget earlier so that they can afford to take on the treatments fee .
Besides that , it is also important for the relatives to have psychological preparation earlier so that they are managed handle their stresses during the period of treatments .
(http://www3 .inter {science .wiley .com/journal/112684945/abstract ?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0}[HYPERLINK: http://www3 .interscience .wiley .com/journal/112684945/abstract ?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0]) Patients refuse to disclose the result as they thought they can prevent their relatives from sadness .
It is true that relatives are often in deep grief when knowing one of their relative is suffering from illness .
However , early notification can let them have enough time to have psychological preparation so that they would not feel so unprepared or unready when the patients' condition get worsen .
In conclusion , the patients should obligated to inform their relatives about genetic testing results to enable them to receive early treatment and have early financial and psychological preparation .
Genetic testing , by definition , may be done for various reasons , including the diagnosis of a genetic disease in an individual , the identification of future disease risks to individual , unborn children or the prediction of drug responses (MedicineNet , 2002) .
Conditions such as cystic fibrosis , heart disease , Down's syndrome and epilepsy are strongly influenced by genes (Hunt & Odle , 2004) .
Due to the possibility that it may occur or recur in various family members and relatives , an ethical dilemma as to whether a carrier of a known genetic risk has the obligation to tell his or her relatives arises .
In order to make an informed socially responsible decision , an individual should examine both sides of this controversy according to his or her context by weighing both the positive and negative economic , social and psychological impacts it may bring about .
Ideally , owing to the beneficial impacts , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives when the risk is familial , significantly critical , and when options are available to prevent harm .
A carrier of a known genetic risk has an ethical duty to warn his or her relatives .
According to Alford (1999) , some genetic conditions may go unnoticed while others may be devitalising .
Some genetic diseases are congenital and others may not be manifest until later in life .
Some genetic diseases can be affected by diet and environment .
Advancements in genetic science have resulted in new discoveries in diagnosing , treating or preventing diseases (Shaw , 1995) .
Prevention is always better than cure .
In general , if at risk relatives can anticipate the disease , measures may be taken to prevent the diseases .
For instance , relatives with genetic obesity may choose to undergo lifestyle changes such as opting for calorie restriction diet and regular exercise .
Furthermore , the ability to predict familial diseases such as a certain type of cancer at a young age may allow for possible successful treatment or cure , extension of life expectancy and improvement in quality of life .
In this way , the sharing of information improves the welfare of mankind .

Moreover , having learnt about a personal genetic risk , it is thought by some theorists , for example , Wilson (2000) , Baker , Schuette and Uhlmann (1998) that the approach to deal with results of genetic testing involves not only medical , surgical and educational intervention , but also provision of social and emotional support , hence a carrier of known genetic risk should tell his or her close relatives about it .
Some may argue that there should be no obligations to tell a relative about one's condition as a genetic condition is not contagious like some viral or bacterial infections (Hubbard & Wald , 1999) .
Consequently , some may think that informing relatives about their conditions is not necessary and thus are not in favour of the idea .
However , genetic diseases may impact every phase of the human life cycle (Alford , 1999) .
Even though there may be an initial delay in acceptance , and unnecessary worry , eventual acceptance by family , friends and relatives often corresponds to ongoing effective and supportive encouragement and motivation which may have beneficial impacts on their health .
A carrier of a known genetic risk who takes an active approach in informing his or her relatives is in fact showing respect for the relative's autonomy .
Choosing not to inform one's relatives is in fact interfering with the patient's right and opportunity to consider the problem , select diagnostic and management options .
Studies have shown that the primary reason accounting for the unwillingness to communicate genetic test results to a relative is that the relative's opinion , attitude and reaction is unknown (Barsevick , Montgomery , Ruth , Ross , Egleston , Bingler , Malick , Miller , Cescon , & Daly , 2008) .
In addition , the opinion of World Health Organization (2009) is that choosing not to inform is a well-intentioned decision which do not to add extra problems and unduly distress to others .
However , these arguments put forth in support of not informing the relative are faulty .
By not informing about the risks his or her relative may face , the tendency of the carrier to shift from beneficence to paternalism has in fact taken away the ability of the relative to choose for herself (Kultgen , 1995) .
For example , some genetic diseases such as "Al antitrypsin deficiency" undeniably involve the family (Torgny & Wilcke , 1998) .
As Torgny and Wilcke states , information can allow a relative who has considerably increased risk of a disease from smoking to make her own decisions about smoking and take precautions when deciding on a career which are needful to have a positive impact on her future .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives as communication of genetic test results can bring about improved management and well-being of carriers and their families , resolution of concerns , possible reduction in disease occurrence , as well as effective prevention , treatments and even cures .
In general , the benefits of knowing the potential risk far outweigh the adverse consequences of not knowing .
Therefore , sharing of information between relatives should be encouraged .

Genetic testing has been made possible with the advances of technology in the medical field .
It has increased in numbers , capabilities and preciseness over the recent years (Goh , 2005) .
Potential individuals who are at risk of developing a genetic disorder or disease normally undergo for genetic testing .
Genetic testing may uncover the underlying mutation in genes which causes the genetic disorder .
Thus , genetic testing can be beneficial to affected patients and their relatives .
It helps in early detection of genetic disorders that are inherited in families and family planning .
Genetic testing has also resulted in the rise of privacy , confidentiality and ethical issues in our society despite the benefits gained (Young & Leonard , 1999) .
However , it has been known that genetic testing may detect mutation in genes and hence , genetic counselling can be given to relatives of affected patients .
Therefore , affected individuals should let their relatives know about their genetic testing results .
One of the reasons why affected individuals should let their relatives know about their genetic disorders is for early detection purposes (Goh , 2005) .
An early detection of genetic disorders can be obtained by genetic testing in order for further and early treatments to be conducted .
For example , genetic testing enables patients and their relatives who are at risk of developing genetic disorders but show no symptoms at the beginning , to predict the chances of them inheriting the genetic disorders (Goh , 2005) .
The predisposition of the relatives of affected patients towards the genetic disorders can also be predicted .
When a genetic disorder that runs through a certain family is known , the extent of the genetic disorder can be obtained (Goh , 2005) .
Genetic information is not confined to one person but it could be related to more than one person such as tested patients' relatives .
This enables healthcare professionals to know the extent of the genetic mutation in the genes and hence , provide advice or genetic counselling to patients and their relatives .
However , this has also resulted in a raise of privacy and confidentiality concerns .
The revelation of genetically tested patients' results may lead to discrimination by society (Mehlman , 1999) .
There is no guarantee that relatives of genetically tested patients will keep the genetic results information to themselves .
This information can be spread verbally , be it accidental or intentional without the consent of the tested patient .
However , there are laws that protect genetically patients from genetic discrimination by society that have been imposed (Bombard , 2007) .
These laws have been implemented in the United States and many other countries (Bombard , 2007) .
Genetic discrimination can be reduced with the existing of these laws as legal actions can be taken against those who discriminate .
Hence , genetic testing results should be revealed to family members for early detection purposes .
Besides that , relatives of genetically tested patients should know about their genetic testing results so that a proper family planning (Anonymous , 1999) .
Family planning is essential as it serves as a platform to briefly set up a guideline for future purposes .
This might enable individuals and their families to decide on how they would like their lifestyle to be and set fertility judgements (Anonymous , 1999) .
For example , pregnant women have the option of deciding on whether to go for prenatal examinations or not to see if their new-borns would suffer from any genetic disorders such as Huntington's disease and Down's Syndrome .
This may prevent the future generation from inheriting the mutated genes or become carriers of the genetic disorders .
Ethical issues have been raised despite this advantage .
This is because no one has the rights to give his or her consent regarding the decision on whether to undergo for the prenatal examinations or not (Anonymous , 1999) .
Embryos , foetuses and new-borns do not hold the responsibility in making this decision and they are unable to make it by themselves .
This leaves the decision into their parents' hands .
However , medical advances have made in-vitro fertilisation possible nowadays .
If an embryo has a mutated gene after undergoing in-vitro fertilisation , this embryo can be discarded before being implanted in the uterus (Anonymous , 1999) .
This may prevent the diseases from being passed down to the future generation .
The risk of the future generation in inheriting genetic diseases can also be reduced .
Thus , revelations of genetic testing results to family members are essential in family planning .
In conclusion , we can see that genetically tested results revealed by patients to their family members do bring advantages .
It can help in early detection and family planning .
Besides that , moral support and encouragement which are vital can be gained from family members .
This is important as genetically tested patients may have emotional and psychological problems as a consequence of undergoing genetic testing .
These problems may not be cured by taking medications .
Therefore , family members play a very important role in supporting them .

In today's medical world , many health concerns raised by people have been taken care of by the perpetual advancement in technology .
One of the innumerable concerns is genetic disorder , which is an illness caused by abnormalities in genes or chromosomes .
This concern brought about the inauguration of genetic testing a medical test to determine if a particular disease is stimulated by the abnormality .
An issue raised here is that one's decision to reveal the test results to one's relatives has chained to even more concerns .
Revealing the results could assist one's relatives in preparing for constructive life changes and allow researchers to find a cure for a particular genetic disorder .
Admittedly , it could result in negative social consequences .
Nevertheless , revealing the test results benefits more people than hiding it .
Hence , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Firstly , the revelation of a known genetic risk to one's relatives allows them to prepare for constructive changes in their lives .
One such change would be to make new decisions for family planning .
Due to the lack of treatment strategies of some genetic disorders , a carrier might have a short lifespan .
Therefore , it is both essential to plan for an early retirement or to start a family .
A carrier could devise a financial plan so that one would have sufficient monetary resources to support oneself even after an early retirement .
One main objection to starting a family is that the affected genes or chromosomes might be passed on to the children .
This , however , can be prevented using an expensive technology , Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) such as pre-implantation of genetic diagnosis whereby "only unaffected embryos are allowed to develop to term" (Norrgard , 2008) .
Thus , a carrier could still start a family without passing the genetic disorder to the children .
Furthermore , this could lead to another constructive change for the carrier's relatives .
For relatives who are planning to have children , they must either be financially prepared for ART as well as the future medical bills , or choose not to have children .
As for those who already have children , they must also be financially prepared .
On top of that , they would have to choose the right time to convey to their children that they might be carriers of a certain genetic disorder .
These changes and preparations cannot be achieved overnight , and therefore , revealing a known genetic risk to one's relatives is necessary .
Secondly , by divulging one's genetic risk to one's relatives , the chances of researchers finding a cure for that risk would be higher .
As genetic disorders only happen to a minority , there would not be many encounters and so the chances of a researcher being able to inquire into these disorders would be considerably low .
This was further lowered by opponents who are against the revelation of genetic results due to intrusion of privacy .
However , it did not occur to them that the revelation of results could increase the chances of medical researchers finding a remedy to the disorders .
Moreover , there would be a possibility that a known genetic risk could be brought to an end and subsequent generations would not have to suffer .
Therefore , only when one tells a known genetic risk to one's relatives , would there be a chance for medical researchers to find a cure for it , and eventually saving many lives from genetic disorders .
One main concern about the revelation of genetic risk to one's relatives is the negative social consequences .
When an employee is diagnosed to have certain genetic disorders , the employer may not want to retain the employee .
This is because the carrier would have to follow up on their medical appointments and as a result , the efficiency and productivity of the company would be adversely affected .
Furthermore , due to the need for regular health checkup , the carrier would not be allowed to purchase insurance as the insurance company would be footing the carrier's medical bills .
However , these acts of genetic discrimination could be prevented by a law called the Privacy Rule , which is enforced by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in April 2003 (Norrgard , 2008) .
This rule helps to keep individual's medical information confidential .
Therefore , whether one has genetic disorders or not , one would not have to face the negative social consequences .
Hence , a carrier can have a peace mind revealing genetic test results to one's relatives .
In conclusion , the obligation of a carrier of a known genetic risk to reveal the results to one's relatives could assist them in adapting to changes in their lives and allow researchers to find a cure for a particular genetic disorder .
Furthermore , the negative social consequences faced by the carrier have been minimized by law .
Thus , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Genetic testing has developed enough and it is getting popular nowadays all around the world .
Genetic testing is actually the genetic diagnosis of inheritable diseases which caused by an abnormality in an individual's genome .
For instance Huntington's disease is caused by X- linked disorder , Cystic fibrosis is caused by autosomal recessive disorder and some common disease such as coronary heart disease , diabetes are caused polygenic mutation (Holland ,S , 2003) .
In addition , this testing also can be used to determine a child's biological father or a person's ancestry .
Examples of genetic tests are newborn screening , diagnostic testing , carrier testing , prenatal testing and few more .
Since genetic testing may open up ethical or psychological problems , carriers of a known genetic risk should be obligated to reveal the results to their relatives .
Firstly , it is important to reveal the result if a couple is planning to get married and one of them has any inheritable diseases .
This is because they have high possibilities of passing on mutated gene to their children .
Even though some are healthy carriers and not affected by the diseases fully because of the single copy of the dominant genotype , they have 50% chance of passing the recessive gene to their generation .
If a person did not disclose the result , a child with genetic disabilities may born and then lead to problems in the family .
For example , the partner may feel betrayed and end the relationship for concealing the truth .
Here the family relation will be affected and who is going to share responsibility of taking care of the poor child ?
The child will be left out and will be in an unpleasant atmosphere .
On the other hand , if the partner knows about this person's genetic condition earlier , they will plan well before getting married since they are in love and care about each other .
They may opt to adopt a child rather than giving birth to a genetically impaired child .
Hence , it is advisable to disclose the genetic testing result in order to prevent risks of diseases to future generation .
The second case is where the couple finding about their genetic condition after their marriage .
It will lead mental trauma and extreme depression if they hide the genetic testing result from their spouse .
Every day he has to face his spouse with guilty face and suffer in silence .
When the spouse gets to know about his health condition , it will be too late and will end the relationship since sincerity will be a big question .
In even extreme cases , if the child is born , it will be burden for them to take care of him .
Then the child's life will be greatly affected .
In contrast , they still can be happy with adopted children if the result is known .
Proponents of this claim argue that , disclosure of such results will destroy the dream of having own family .
However , it is not ethical to pass on their defective genes to their offspring in order to fulfill the dream of having own family .
Who will take care of the child when they are not around ?
If they are someone to take care , will they do it sincerely ?
Therefore , the carrier of a known genetic disease should be forced to reveal the result to his spouse since loyalty and sincerity are the basic factors that holding a marriage tightly and the relationship can be maintained .
Finally , the third case is about the couple knowing about the genetic disorder after having children .
They should tell about their health condition to prevent their future offspring to have defective genes .
Since this genetic testing begins with an affected family member , it provides the best opportunity to identify relative who may be at risk for a life- threatening condition .
Thus they will be undergo testing and treatment for that specific disease as soon as possible .
Critics of this position may argue that disclosure brings with it the potential for loss of privacy .
Is privacy is more important the health condition and welfare of your spouse and children ?
It is so obvious that , they did not realize that the health condition of the beloved family members is far more important rather than concerning about the intrusion of privacy .
Hence , carrier of genetic disease must be obligated to tell the genetic testing result since the welfare of family members can be improved .
In conclusion , a carrier of genetic disorder must be obligated to reveal the genetic testing results to his relatives .
By doing so , genetic risks to future generation can be prevented , family relation can be maintained and at-risk relatives with abnormalities can begin treatment for their genetic disorders .
If an individual is failed to do so , family relation may comes to an end and undergoes mental trauma and depression .
Humans have always wanted to be the perfect being on top of nature's hierarchy .
We also desire to have the ability to predict our own well-being .
Presently , with advances in medical technology , we are able to predict what is happening to our own body .
The procedure called genetic testing .
Genetic testing is the testing of the human genes to know whether there are mutations or defects in the genes (Genetic Research and Genetic Testing , 2005) .
With this technology , we can detect the problem within ourselves early and tackle it .
The issue is that after an individual undergo genetic testing and unfortunately found out that there are problems within him or herself , is the individual obligated to tell his or her family members ?
With the information that the individual acquired through genetic testing , he or she can share with the family members so that they can tackle the problems head on .
They can prepare themselves for medical problems that they may have and make informed choices on the course of action .
Hence a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Firstly , a carrier should inform his or her family as this will prepare the family for the possible outcome of them having the mutated genes .
This is a good move as the family now can prepare themselves to undergo the same genetic testing to know the possibility of them carrying the mutated or defective genes same as the carrier .
The genetic testing is just a mean to know whether someone has the disease but it does not mean they will acquire the disease hundred percent (Goh , L . , M . , D . , 2005) .
This only serves as a predictive mean .
On the other hand , the other family members can also know what are the other underlying problems that they may encounter in the future as the genetic testing will not only detect the carrier's risk genes but also other problems that he or she may have in the future .
With these ease in information acquired it will help the family members to prepare and face the potential problems in the future .
Secondly , a carrier should inform his or her family as the family members have the ability to make an informed choice for their actions towards the problem .
If the carrier has a possibility of having heart disease , the rest of the family members may take steps to counter that predictive disease (Genetic Research and Genetic Testing , 2005) .
The family members can alter their activities and eating habits in order to combat having heart disease .
However the risk genes carrier may argue that to tell the information to his or her family member is a violation towards his or her autonomy .
This is private information that need not be shared with everyone .
This information may cause hysteric reaction in the community explain more .
Other than that the risk genes carriers may be discriminated (Ostrom , M . , C . , 1997) .
With these concerns in mind , the individual may not agree to tell the family members the information they acquired through genetic testing .
But by withholding the information , the risk genes carrier is doing harm to not only himself but to his or her family members .
Without telling the family members , the individual might be suffering in silence and no support are given by the family members .
On the other hand if the risk genes carrier never informs the family members , the family members may suffer the same fate and this in turn will have a domino effect on the family lineage .
Therefore the to be obliged to tell the family members is act of beneficence as the risk gene carrier is doing good in informing the family of the possible medical problems that they may face .
In conclusion , it is very important for the risk genes carrier to inform the family members as he or she may help the family members to avoid huge medical problems which may be avoided if only he or she inform them .
Therefore the risk gene carrier should be obliged to tell the family members if he or she has genetic risk within them .
As science and technology progressed , we could now detect the presence of any genetic disorder in individual through genetic testing .
The purpose of genetic testing is to identify changes in chromosomes , genes , or proteins which are associated with inherited disorders .
However , one biggest problem that arises is whether the individual , who had undergone the genetic test , be obligated to inform his family members/relatives the results .
I believe that the individual is obligated to tell his family members/relatives the test result as it is ethical for the individual to inform them and they can seek early medical assistance if needed .
The psychological and emotional issues like feeling guilty and anxiety that arises from this issue can be minimized by going for counseling .
Firstly , family members/relatives deserve a right to know what kind of genetic disorder they might have inherited from the individual or running in their family line .
Thus , it is ethical for the individual to inform them .
This is important for parents who are doing family planning , as it help them to know whether an unborn child will have a genetic condition .
In this example , a pregnant relative seeking genetic counseling and his geneticist requires information about the individual in order to give her the most accurate information whether her new-born has any risk of genetic disorder .
If the individual declined her request as he wished that the information about his genetic status to be confidential , her new-born could be in high risk of getting the genetic disorder (Elizabeth A . V . , Amy C .S . , 2008 , Nov 07) .
Secondly , acquisition of genetic information of carrier by his/her relatives can help reduce the possibility of getting the disease .
For example , the genetic disorder is colon cancer; they can seek out for medical advices and treatment while it is at early stage .
If the disease has not developed , steps like making changes to their health habits can be taken which might lower their chance of getting the disease (National Human Genome Research Institute , 2009 , Aug 14) .
Thus , this information can help them in making informed choices about their future .
Critics have also raised the psychological and emotional issues that the individual and his relatives may experience after he tells them the genetic test result .
His relatives might blame him for 'passing' the genetic disorder to them , causing the individual to feel guilty .
However , being the carrier , he too is a victim of this genetic disorder which was probably passed down from his parents .
In addition , his relatives will understand better by going for counseling that everyone carries gene mutations that can lead to disease , and no one has control over what they pass on to their children (Elizabeth A . V . , Amy C .S . , 2008 , Nov 07) .
Relatives of the individual will also face a great deal of anxiety that they may have the genetic disorder .
However , they can choose not to be told of the test result in the first place or go for a genetic testing to confirm whether they have the genetic disorder .
If the genetic test result shows that the genetic disorder is not present in them , it can provide them a sense of relief .
Furthermore , they could also undergo counseling to help them manage their emotions better (Genetic Interest Group , 1998) .
In conclusion , I believe that the carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his relatives .
It is ethnically right for the individual to inform his relatives and the relatives after knowing that they may have the genetic disorder can seek out medical assistances to reduce the occurrence/severity of the disease .
The psychological and emotional issues can be minimized by going for counseling as they will understand the genetic disorder and manage their emotions better .
Should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?
Genetic testing is a scientific method that is used to determine a person's chance of developing an inherited disease .
Every person carries copies of genes that were passed down from their parents .
There is a high chance for a genetic disease carrier to pass down defected genes to the next generation .
The defected genes may or may not develop into a disease .
A defected genes carrier can only determine whether he or she have a genetic disease by running a genetic test .
Since genetic disease runs in the family , a genetic disease carrier's family members and relatives will have high chance of developing the same inherited disease .
There is a higher chance of curing a genetic disease if it is detected early .
Hence , a carrier of a known genetic risk should warn their family members and relatives about the genetic risk .
Some of the genetic diseases could be cured if it is detected early .
Research by Kloosterman (2009) , shows that common antibiotic treatment has the ability to cure genetic diseases such as Cystic Fibrosis , a type of genetic lung disease .
From the Georgina Advocate news (2007) , "Emily Gough , who died last year of Cystic Fibrosis , was seen with her father , Glenn , and sister , Jessica , who is now battling the same disease" .
In this article , the Gough family is battling against a genetic lung disease .
(Slykhuis , 2007) Unfortunately , Emily Gough and her father died because they did not detect the disease early enough to cure it .
Such tragic incident will re-occur if a carrier of a known genetic risk were to hide his or her condition from his or her family members and relatives .
Proper plans for the future could be made if a carrier knows in advance that he or she has a genetic disease .
Oregon National Primate Research Center successfully came up with a technique that could stop future generations from inheriting genetic diseases from their parents .
(Henderson , 2009) If a carrier of a genetic risk were to hide his or her condition , the genetic disease will continue to run in the family line , passing down to future generations .
Proper financial plans could be made if a person were to know early if he or she has a genetic disease and avoid impending financial crisis if he or she is able borrow money or apply for financial help earlier .
A possible excuse people choose to hide their affliction is because they are afraid of the discrimination they would face from their family members and relatives .
After all , the burden of carrying a genetic disease is not something that one would want to make known to others .
Perhaps a better reason for people to keep the problem to themselves is because they are not aware that genetic diseases are not isolated to just themselves .
This is a case of ignorance in which is not at all bliss .
There is no good reason for a genetic disease carrier to hide his or her condition from his or her family members or relatives if the person is aware of the implication of the genetic disorder .
This is a question of morality .
A person who understands his role and responsibility as part of a family would not want to see his future generation be it his own , or his immediate families' to suffer from genetic diseases that could otherwise have been prevented if he had discussed his condition .
The reasons to inform out weigh the reasons not to , hence , a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives .
The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing
First of all , one's private life is a main perspective of protecting human rights .
According to the definition of private life provided by the European Convention on Human Rights , it "includes the right to be protected from the unwanted publication or disclosure of intimate personal information" CITATION Eth06 \l 1033 ( Ethics in genetic research and practice , 2006) .
As mentioned before , the experiment unit oneself is the most influenced one by this genetic testing , so he or she should decide whether to tell anyone else or merely conceal from others .
Imagine that the top-secret information is released regardless of how the individual feels .
The rule of protecting human rights is violated .
Thus the individual should have the final say .
Secondly , the result might be misused against the individual if the choice is left to other sides .
Once the information that a normal employee is likely to be diagnosed with some rare gene-related diseases , the employer might be reluctant to keep the hiring relationship because he has to consider the duration of the employee's commitment may be disturbed by sudden illnesses .
Possible breakups might take place before marriage simply due to the fiance's comparatively higher chance to pass the so-called "bad" gene to the next generation .
Hence it is decided by the individual who takes the genetic testing how to deal with the result .
Opponents may address the equal human rights of the individual's family .
It cannot be denied that they also have the right to know if their genes also possess lurking variables that can cause diseases .
This topic is discussing whether the individual has the final say , instead of whether the individual can hide the truth from others .
A normal person will probably choose the best solution for his or her family .
The cases of concealing caused by selfishness can be decreased by improving the education of moral values .
If the decision is leaved to others , the chance of perfect equality is also questionable .
What is more , people may be reluctant to undergo testing for that they cannot decide by their own .
Then the purpose of this advanced technology cannot be realized .
To conclude , the individual requesting human rights should have the final say in whether to say the result or not , considering protected human rights .

Genetics plays the role in every disease .
Genetic testing informs individuals and family of their genetic status; this knowledge may enable them to take adaptive measures against a genetic disease (Jacobs & Deatrick , 1999) , if the disease is treatable .
One is morally obligated to inform the relatives of the genetic test results since family members generally inherit the same set of genetic codes from their parents .
Firstly , informing relatives allows them to take preventive measures against diseases .
Having the same parents can mean that certain disease can run within the family and they are morally obligated to warn their relatives of the possible hazards that may trigger disease , For example , to prevent relatives from eating fava beans when one is detected to have G6PD deficiency .
One can even educate relatives of the preventive measures of certain diseases .
For example , to educate relatives to eat less fatty meals when their genes predispose too weak blood vessels integrity that are prone to rupture .
However , some argued that genetic testing can potentially unravel family secrets; namely adoptions and illegitimate child (Doukas & Berg , 2001) .
But such issues can be solved since we can select results to be in terms of potential disease , instead of paternity testing .
Therefore , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives for the betterment of the relatives to take preventive measures and also be equipped with related knowledge to save their own lives .
The advent of genetic testing has created a scientific breakthrough in identifying risk factors for disease .
The increasing awareness of the usefulness of genetic testing has prompted many to undergo such testing .
However , genetic testing result may not only concern the tested individual themselves but also their family members as they share the same genetic make-up and are equally at risk of contracting a certain disease (Genetic testing helps cancer survivors fight for their loved ones , 2007) .
This has sparked many debates on the obligation of an individual to share the test result with genetic relatives .
While the common consensus is that every individual should have the final decision on whether to reveal the result to others , a decision made not to reveal the result to relatives may have it consequences .
In addition , withholding the result may also have a negative effect on the individual psychologically .
Thus , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Firstly , individual who have undergone genetic testing , should be obligated inform his or her relatives of the genetic testing result as they may also be equally at risk .
By informing relatives of the result , they are able make necessary lifestyle and dietary changes in order to reduce the risk of getting the disease (Genetic testing helps cancer survivors fight for their loved ones , 2007) .
This also allows family members to step up their preventive measures against the diseases by undergoing regular medical screening .
Furthermore , they can be subjected to early treatment should they get diagnosed with the disease (Babowice , 2008) .
Such early treatment will greatly increase the prospects of recovery as it will prevent the disease from developing further and causing more complication .
Some may argue that it is the individual's right as to whether to reveal the result to others as the genetic test result belongs to him or her .
Therefore , they should have the final say as to whether to share it with others and should not be obligated to do so .
However , the reticence of one's genetic test result would mean that family members are unaware of the possible danger to their health .
Furthermore , it may be too late to be treated should the disease be discovered at a later stage .
Thus , the possibility of preventing harm to others should never be jeopardised over one's privacy .
A research conducted by the United States' National Institute of Health , has shown that 98% of the respondents share their test results with their family members and 82 .2% of them did that to inform them of their medical risk (Stoffel , Ford , Mercado , Punglia , Kohlmann , Conrad , Blanco , Shannon , Powell , Gruber , Terdiman , Chung , Syngal , 2008) .
This research result is a testimony that majority of those who went for genetic testing acknowledge that by sharing their genetic result with their family members , something can be done to reduce the risk of contracting a disease .
Another reason as to why an individual should be obligated to inform the genetic test result to his or her relatives is so that they may be able to receive emotional support from the family (Newstaff , 2009) .
Many a time , a tested individual chose not to share such result with their loved one so as not to add unnecessary distress and anxiety to them .
However , bottling up their feeling will only aggravate their problem as it will have an adverse psychological effect on them .
By sharing such information with family members , individuals may share their problems and worries with them .
On top of that , they may lighten the burden off their shoulder .
According to a research conducted by Georgetown University Medical Centre , those who disclosed their genetic test results to their family members are much contented with their decision than those who did not (Newstaff , 2009) .
Many have also shared their views that informing the test result to their family members had led to a better communication relationship .
Critics argue that genetic testing result is not fully accurate and by informing relatives regarding the result , it will impose unnecessary psychological burden to the family .
This may result in family members responding negatively to the news and thus , straining the ties between the tested individual and his or her family members .
Therefore , contrary to gaining emotional support from family members , individual may instead be subjected to further psychological damage .
As this may be true , the argument is not entirely valid .
Research conducted by Angela Bradbury , an oncologist at Chase Fox , has shown that such worries are uncalled for (Newstaff , 2009) .
Only a small portion of the respondents have reported to receive negative responses from their family members .
Many have given feedback that their relatives have handled the news well and have taken a pragmatic approach to the situation .
Counseling will also be provided by physicians not only to the individual but also his or her family members (Stoffel et al . , 2008) .
This will make it easier for family members to come to term with the situation and to handle it appropriately .
Critics also fail to acknowledge that it is part of the "social responsibility" on the part of the tested individual to inform genetic relatives of a hereditary condition and the sharing of financial , emotional and psychological burdens among family members .
It is undeniable that an individual have the final say as to whether to reveal his or her genetic test result .
However , one should always remember that choosing not to do so will only further implicate more problems to oneself as well as to others .
Disclosure of such information to relatives will instead bring about many benefits .
Thus , carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
The new millennium brought about promising medical advancements that have positive impacts on human's lives .
Remarkable breakthroughs , particularly in the field of genetics , allow humans to better understand the cause of diseases , so as to formulate cure or preventive drugs that can be tailored to individual idiosyncrasies .
This is made possible through a series of genetic tests on an individual .
Genetic testing is the detection of abnormalities in the human genomes , to indentify presence of genetic disorder and to assess the possible risk of developing genetic disorder in the future .
Some examples of such genetic disorders include single gene defects , multifactorial problems and teratogenic problems (Weill Medical College of Cornell University 2003) .
Though the benefits of genetic testing are numerous , individuals are forced to face an ethical dilemma of whether they are obligated to reveal the results to their relatives .
In my opinion , I believe that individuals should be obligated to reveal such information to their relatives .
Proponents who felt that individuals should be obligated to reveal genetic test results asserted that these individuals will have a more open communication relationship with their families .
This is coherent to a study done by Gerogetown university medical center on mothers who shared their cancer genetic test results with children .
The research findings shows that mothers who chose to disclose the results are generally satisfied with their decision because they are able to receive the necessary support and understanding from families (Karen 2009) .
Individuals are able to reduce the huge mental burden imposed on them by sharing it with families , which in certain cases can be overwhelming .
This can lead to better mental health and well-being of the individuals .
Though families will be distraught by the results , accepting the fact and supporting each other in the course might lead to a stronger relationship within the family .
Moreover , disclosing the results to their immediate families will better prepare them for any unforeseen circumstances , financially and mentally .
Thus the revealing of genetic results can reduce the mental burden of an individual and bring about better communication and understanding with his or her relatives .
Another point that supports the need of revealing such results to the individual's relatives is to allow early detection of inheritable diseases that his or her relatives might be prone to .
The cancer of the large intestine , which is an inherited disorder , has subtle early stage symptoms that can progress almost undetected till the terminal stages .
When individuals chose to reveal such information to their relatives , relatives will be able to undergo aggressive and constant monitoring of the colon growth which can prevent the disease into becoming fatal (Burt and Jasperson 2008) .
Such early prevention and cure to fatal diseases are only possible if relatives are notified beforehand , and that responsibility lies on the individual who underwent genetic testing .
Such information will also allow family members and relatives to make more fully informed choices regarding their future , including decisions on marriage and career , as well as lifestyle habits .
Thus individual of known genetic risk should be obligated to reveal test results to relatives because it brings awareness concerning the risk of inheriting the disease to the foreground , not only to the person tested , but for his or her relatives as well .
Arguments brought forward by opponents claimed that the personal rights of the individual are being violated .
This is a bias claim because it failed to consider at-risk relatives' rights to know about the test results .
Relatives have the rights to be informed of the results because they are prone to inheriting the same disease or disorder which can be fatal if discovered too late .
When individuals chose not to reveal the results , it is mainly because of the following reasons: the fear of discrimination , fear of being a burden to the family or not wanting to worry their families .
This is a selfish thinking and is an illogical way of avoiding the problem .
The failure of disclosure of genetics test results frequently cause relatives to be enraged and upset , and this had lead to numerous lawsuits against the genetics provider , as they felt that it should be these genetic providers' responsibilities to inform them , but in fact is the responsibility of the person being tested (Falk , J . M , Dugan , B . R . & O'Riordan , A . M . 2002) .
Thus detrimental effects on both parties can be seen due to the failure of disclosing genetic test results to relatives .
In conclusion , individuals should be obligated to reveal such information to their relatives because it is a personal responsibility , and can lead to improvement of their well-being .
Moreover , relatives should also be informed about the potential dangers of inheriting such disorders so that they are able to make choices and decisions that can change their future for the better .
Through technological advancement and intense scientific research , genetics strives to be one of the most lucrative and beneficial medical sectors .
Through genetic testing , an individual would be able to detect if there are any genetic imperfections and disorders .
It also provides an insight to the chances of developing terminal illnesses .
Such genetic risks have a high percentage chance of appearing in the family thus the question lies if the information be revealed by the carrier to his or her relatives for the bigger picture , or to be kept to him or herself .
The carrier of a known genetic risk should to tell his or her relatives to inform them of the health implications , to gain emotional support and to adhere to the ethical and legal obligations .
Firstly , the carrier should inform his or her relatives of the health implications that the genetic test results would affect them .
Most genetic disorders have a high percentage possibility of inheritance and also due to genetic similarities , appear in family members .
Thus family members should be informed so that precautionary measures could be taken by them to prepare for the possibility of the illness in the future .
The relatives could go for regular monitoring of their health conditions .
Furthermore , relatives could go for their own testing to ascertain their chances to the genetic disorder as an individual .
With the testing the relatives could make adjustments to their lifestyle to lower the risk and also to prepare case of ever developing the illness (Sturm , Varga 2008) .
It can be argued that the carrier might be causing unnecessary worrying to his or her relatives as the accuracy of genetic test results varies and also dependent on various factors (Goh , 2003) .
Yet with the knowledge of the existence of such risk , the relatives can better prepare for themselves both physically and emotionally so as to be able to recover or overcome the stress if the genetic disorder turning into a medical condition .
Secondly , by telling his or her relatives , the carrier would be able to gain emotional support and understanding to overcome such trying times .
After knowing the results , the carrier might be in distraught and lost over what to do for the future .
In such situation , the care and concern of the family members are crucial in helping reduce the stress .
This is even more so if the genetic testing showed the possibility of the other family members and relatives may also have the genetic disorder .
The family would be able to understand each other and provide the comfort that they are overcoming the problem together .
With regards to the health conditions , having family and relative support also help in taking care of each other physically should medical conditions develop .
Some may be concerned that relatives might reject the risks and in turn discriminate the carrier for his or her genetic disorder especially if the developed illness is communicable .
Yet we could not undermine the power of family bonds and the support they can give .
The situation of discrimination is subjective and does not amount to a general trend in family relationships .
Lastly , the carrier is required to conform to the ethical and legal obligations in which genetic testing results is needed to be revealed in certain situations .
The American Society of Clinical Oncology concurs that disclosure may be permitted if the carrier refuse to disclose the information; the disease caused by the disorder is highly probable to occur , serious , yet preventable and treatable or with early monitoring could reduce its risk .
(Lee 2005) .
With that the medical personnel would disclose the information to the relatives in view of the medical concerns that may arise .
It is also ethical to inform the relatives so that he or she can minimize the emotional trauma inflicted to the relatives if they would to find out that the genetic disorder previously unidentified had turning into an illness .
This is especially so since they are part of the family and not strangers .
In conclusion the carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives for the benefit of their future .
The carrier should inform them of the health implications , to gain emotional support and to adhere to the ethical and legal obligations .
It is true that the decision of revelation lies with the carrier which means that more care should be taken when making a decision with the benefit of the relatives in mind .
Genetic testing is a process in which a one's DNA or an {embryo}[HYPERLINK: http://dictionary .reference .com/browse/embryo]'s {DNA}[HYPERLINK: http://dictionary .reference .com/browse/DNA] is abstracted and examined for the existence of particular {genes}[HYPERLINK: http://dictionary .reference .com/browse/genes] or deficiency that could signify the future attack of certain disease .
When an individual is tested positive as a carrier of a particular known genetic risk , such as 1 antitrypsin deficiency- where an insignificant adjustment in the style of living can prevent one from an "early death" (Wilcke 1998) , or Huntington's disease-where there is no approach to change the consequences of the result (Wilcke 1998) , he or she will be in a state of dilemma- should he or she be obliged to inform his or her family members ?
Some suggested that when one's relatives are informed of the result , it can cause additional anxiety on the relatives concerned and invade on their lives , thus the positive result should not be disclosed to one's relatives .
However , by informing ones' relatives of the result not only allow them to escape from early deaths through small adjustments in their lifestyles but also ensure the safety of third parties .
Thus , the reveal of the result to relatives has effectuated significant advantages .
Hence , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Firstly , when the relatives of a carrier of a known genetic risk are informed of the positive test result , the chance of early deaths of the relatives is minimised .
This is because certain genetic diseases may be accentuated by external factors .
When an individual is made known to the external factors , he or she can make adjustments to his or her daily lifestyle .
Consequently , the chance of an early death due to the genetic disease is reduced since one is not exposed to the decisive risk factor .
For instance , one is tested positive for 1 antitrypsin deficiency- a genetic disease in which smoking is the decisive risk factor (Wilcke 1998) .
When the carrier informed his or her relatives of the positive result , the relatives can restrain themselves from smoking .
This not only minimises the chance of them developing the disease but more importantly reduces the chance of dying early .
Secondly , the reveal of the result to relatives ensures the safety of third parties .
When one is tested positive for genetic diseases which can cause one to expose others to danger , one should reveal the result to his or her relatives .
This is because one's relative could be in professions such as train conductor , air traffic controller and airline pilot (Wachbroit 1996) .
These relatives might have a condition that would hamper their job performance in such a way as to expose other people to danger (Wachbroit 1996) .
For example , one is tested positive for Huntington's disease- a disease that causes rampant movements .
When one's relative is in a particular profession such as airline pilot and the relative is not informed of the positive result , he or she will continue in his or her profession .
However , the relative might not be able to control his or her movements while on the midst of controlling the aeroplane due to the Huntington's disease .
This may cause a disastrous accident which results in the death of many passengers .
Meanwhile , this disastrous accident may be prevented if the relative is informed of the result by the carrier .
This is because the relative may go for genetic testing and if one is confirmed to have the disease , he or she will not continue in his or her profession and thus will not expose others to danger .
Hence , the reveal of the testing result ensures the safety of third parties .
It has been claimed that the disclosure of the testing result can create unnecessary distress on the relatives concerned and may invade radically on their lives .
However , the relatives might have significant effects if they are not informed of the result .
This is because they might make themselves vulnerable to the decisive risk determinants of any particular genetic disease (Wilcke 1998) .
If they are informed of the result , they might avoid the risk of developing the disease .
Thus , the consequences of being informed of the result are more preferable than staying in ignorance .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives as it not only allows them to escape from early deaths through changes in their lifestyles but also contributes to the safety of third parties .
Genetic testing is a medical test , using blood or tissue from a patient that can definitively determine if a mutation in the genome of the patient is causing a specific disease (Norrgard , 2008) .
The testing reveals many types of diseases and disorders such as Huntington's disease , cancer and Down syndrome .
The decision to undergo genetic testing is actually a personal choice as it is influenced by factors such as family history and having the risk for a disorder .
The result of the test is an important matter as it affects the life of the individual and their family .
Family members play important roles such as supportive and caregiver role and patient advocate role .
Due to these , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her family members .
A carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her family members because the family members play a supportive and caregiver role (Mahowald , McKusick , Scheuerle and Aspinwall , 2001) .
An individual being diagnosed to be a carrier of a genetic risk will be definitely lost and depressed .
In this case , family members are important to provide mental supports to the patient .
The support given will be a great pushed for the patient to look forward and face the reality bravely .
Besides , family members also help patient to think through all relevant medical options which are the best for the patient (Mahowald et al . , 2001) .
In addition , family members play a caregiver role as well .
They provide care and company the patient all along the way for them to accept the fact as a carrier of the disorder .
Through the support and care provided by family members , patients could accept the genetic risk eventually .
Thus , a carrier of the genetic risk should tell his or her family members .
Other than that , the patient should tell the result of the test to their family members because family members act as patient advocate role (Mahowald et al . , 2001) .
This will benefit the patient as the family members will think all sort of ways to ensure patient receives all necessary care .
They will question the health care team and try to get more information for the patient .
These help the patient to decide the best treatment for them .
For example , a patient that has cancer can undergo several treatments to control the spread of the cancerous cells .
In this case , family members who have the information of the treatment can help the patient to decide the best treatment for the patient .
Conversely , if the patient has not tell the family members the result of the genetic test , the patient will be definitely in lost and irrational in making decision .
Therefore , a carrier of genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her family members .
Opponents may argue that a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives due to the principles of confidentiality and privacy (Norrgard , 2008) .
They claimed that a carrier should have the rights to keep the result .
This is because the carrier thinks that revealing the result of the test will affect the life of the whole family .
It will create tension for the family .
However , the family members have the rights to know the result .
Since some of the genetic diseases and disorders are hereditary , therefore there are potential risks for the family members to inherit the disease .
The result should be revealed to them in order to be faired to them .
They have the rights to prevent and ensure their safety .
Besides , carriers themselves will be in an unstable emotion condition upon knowing the result .
They are unable to make decision rationally .
Thus , the result should be told to their relatives .
Hence , the relatives can make rational decision for the patient and this probably what the patient needs the most .
In conclusion , relatives play an instrumental role to help the patient in facing the genetic disease .
They support , care and advocate the patient .
The issue of privacy should be put aside since the benefits of the patient are on priority .
Thus , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Genetic testing can be classified as a medical test that detects changes in the genes , chromosomes or proteins .
The testing is usually done to find changes related with inherited diseases or disorders .
({http://ghr .nlm .nih .gov/handbook/testing/genetictesting}[HYPERLINK: http://ghr .nlm .nih .gov/handbook/testing/genetictesting] ) Some of the diseases that can be detected are Huntington disease , Thalassemia , Cystic fibrosis and Alzheimer disease .
Results from a genetic testing can help to ascertain the percentage of chances of a person developing or passing on a genetic disease .
Genetic testing is done voluntary by a person and often , the question "should a person who is found to be a carrier of genetic disorder through the genetic testing tell his or her family" arises when it comes to releasing the results of the test .
In my opinion , the carrier of a known genetic disease should be obligated to tell his or her family members .
One should be obligated to reveal his or her own genetic test's results to his family members as the results can help in family planning .
A person who is thinking of marrying , should let his partner know that he has genetic problem as the other party is going to spend the rest of her life with him and it will be unfair to keep her in the dark .
Not only that , those who are already married should also reveal the results to his spouse so that they can come up with a plan for their family like how many children they want and whether they want to take the risk of having a child  .
Taking care of children with serious genetic disorder is not an easy task , and as such , a couple should inform each other of their genetic problem first and try to discuss the consequences and think of a solution together instead of keeping it a secret .
However , critics may say that it is not necessary to inform his spouse about his condition as sometimes the baby will not inherit the disease and even if the baby do inherit the disorder , abortion can still be done while the foetus is still inside the mother's womb .
However , this is not an ethical thing to do and inhuman to terminate a life .
It will be much more better if they have discuss and plan earlier and thus a desperate measure such as abortion need not be made .
Besides that , a carrier of a known genetic problem should be obligated to tell his family members so that the chances of treating or at least improving his disease will be much more higher .
This is because , when his family members know that he is suffering from a genetic problem , they will try all means to help him to improve his condition .
A person will usually feel depress and even suffers emotional breakdown when he knows that he suffers from a certain disease what more if it is a disease inherited from his parents , thus when his family knows about his condition , they can persuade , paying more attention to him and even encourage him to go for treatment and not to give up .
Not only that , maybe his family members have wider contacts than him and can recommend alternative medicine or a specialist doctor which in turn can increase his chance to recover .
However , there has also been some suggestions that the carrier of a certain genetic disease who knows it through genetic testing should not be obligated to tell his family members as he will be discriminated and sometimes even be treated as an outcast in his family .
Nevertheless , he should be mentally prepared and thinks positively as eventually his family members will surely accept him as blood is always thicker than water .
In conclusion , a person should be obligated to reveal his genetic testing's results as it has more advantages in doing so than disadvantages as encouragement from his family and family planning is crucial to a person with genetic disorder .
What will be this world if people are capable of viewing their genetic testing results as easily as ordering a dinner in a restaurant ?
Nowadays , there is a new type of technology , named genetic testing , which is designed to find changes that are associated with inherited disorders (Genetic testing , 2009) .
With the help of genetic test , people are able to find or rule out some suspected genetic problems and will be clear about the risks of developing or passing on a genetic disorder .
However , if individual are allowed to have the final say in revealing the results of such testing , although it has many benefits , its disadvantages still outweigh these advantages overwhelmingly .
That is to say , letting people possess the right to view such testing results is potentially harmful to our community .
Hence , people should not have the final say in whether to reveal the result of genetic tests .
This essay will concentrate on two aspects to illustrate the reasons: side effects of the genetic testing on families and society (Nicholson , 2007) .
Firstly , as for the family aspect , genetic testing may create tension among family members (Genetic testing , 2009) .
It is because one person's result will have deep effects on others' due to their kinship .
For example , if a parent or a child knows that he gets a kind of genetic disorder , then their children or parents may worry about not only his health but also themselves' all the time .
This brings about a lot of trouble to the whole family and affects the family harmony .
Besides , if a baby is diagnosed some genetic problems , some parents may abandon their child due to the endless treatments and high-priced medical cost instead of hoping to cure their child and trying their best .
Hence , if the results of genetic testing are allowed to reveal to individuals , such phenomena will happen more frequently than before and it will make a difference on society .
Then as for the social aspects , genetic testing may also be sensational (Nicholson , 2007) .
For instance , if the employers know the genetic testing results of their potential employees , they will intend to hire those who are much healthier than others .
Otherwise , their employees may ask for a sick leave from time to time , which will affect the normal operations of the companies .
Besides , if an insurance agent knows the results of a particular customer , then salesmen will try to avoid offering insurance service to one who has some kind of genetic disorder .
Instead , they will spare no effort to sell insurance to the healthy population .
In a word , genetic testing may lead to a genetic discrimination in employment and insurance industry (Genetic testing , 2009) .
Moreover , even if people know their results of genetic testing , usually they are able to do very little nothings .
It is because genetic testing cannot predict how severely one person will be affected by the disordered genes .
What is can do is only detecting whether there are any genetic problems .
Also , for most kinds of the genetic disorders , the medical technology nowadays is not capable of curing them (What is genetic testing ?
n .d .) .
Therefore , personally viewing of the results of genetic testing will cause a lot of problems to society .
Actually , whether individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in revealing the results of such testing is a heated controversy in society today .
While the genetic testing can assist people in predicting and ruling out some genetic disorders and problems which are hard to be find in daily life , it will still bring about some difficult problems to human beings to some extent .
Hence , the individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
Advancements in medical science have led to an increase in the number of people undergoing genetic testing .
They go through medical tests to detect changes in their genes , thus identifying the possibility of them or their related-family member developing a inherited disorder (Genetic Home Reference , 2009) .
As such , a controversy occurs as to whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
The test results obtained from genetic testing will have ethical and social issues .
Thus , an individual of a known genetic risk should be obligated to inform his/her relatives .
Firstly , there are ethical implications involved .
It would be morally wrong not to inform an identifiable individual of having a possibility of developing genetic disease .
For instance , a parent with high blood pressure may affect the child to inherit the disease .
Researchers have shown that his/her child will have a 35 percent to 65 percent chance of inheriting it (Edelson , 2009) .
Thus , the parent should warn the child of this possibility .
The child can take precaution on his/her diet and exercise regularly to reduce the risk of having high blood pressure .
On the other hand , some may question on the accuracy of genetic testing , and the unnecessary worries it might bring to an individual .
However , prevention is always better than cure and with additional caution , worries will be eliminated .
Secondly , social issues will also occur .
The genetic disease may spread among the community if an individual is unaware of a possible genetic disorder developing in him/her .
In the case of Huntington's disease , the related family member will have a 50 percent possibility of having the disease (Norrgard , 2008a) .
If so unfortunately the related family member were to develop the disease and carry on with giving birth , his/her child will in turn have a 50 percent chance of having the disease .
When this cycle carries on , it will create a social problem as the disease has now been spread into the society .
Thus , the individual should be obligated to inform his/her relatives to avoid such situation .
On the contrary , others may feel that the individual will be discriminated due to his/her disease .
However , there are laws which protect the individual from discrimination (Norrgard , 2008b) .
This can give the individual a sense of assurance that they have equal chances (in looking for a job) as compared to others .
There are those who feel that an individual of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to inform his/her relatives as genetic results is private and of high confidentiality (HOPES , 2002) .
While it is true that genetic test result are confidential , in the case where another life is at risk , we should be more considerate and help save another life .
In conclusion , an individual of a known genetic risk should be obligated to inform his/her relatives as both ethical and social implications will occur .
Surveillance technology such as RFID technology is used for the purpose of monitoring changes , behaviour , activities and keeping track of mainly humans and sometimes , animals .
RFID technology has been around for more than 10 years and it is used by different bodies or organizations (Ramdasi , 2009) .
Thus , it is not something uncommon among our society as it is incorporated in many applications of our daily lives such as tracking people and animals .
The acronym RFID stands for Radio Frequency Identification and it is widely used in different industries .
We may rely too much on RFID technology that it may take a toll on some of us .
This has resulted in the raise of privacy and ethical issues within our society .
However , it has been known that RFID technology brings benefits to various elements of our lives and it helps in solving problems that we may encounter while handling different tasks and even correct human errors .
Hence , RFID technology such as human implants and RFID tags should be used to monitor people .
One of the vital advantages of the use of RFID technology is that it can boost the security level effectively in a few areas within certain proximity (Ramdasi , 2009) .
Safety and security is the primary concern when it comes to managing a business .
For example , RFID tags are widely used in jewellery stores , supermarkets and boutiques .
Merchandises in the respective stores are tagged with RFID tags and RFID readers will be placed at the checkout counters (Ramdasi , 2009) .
Once an RFID tagged item is brought out via an RFID reader , it will trigger the alarm and security guards will be alerted upon hearing the alarm .
Thus , this decreases the chances of thefts .
Besides that , RFID tags come in various shapes and sizes and the information contained in the RFID tags are not easily duplicated (Ramdasi , 2009) .
This increases the security level and efficacy of the surveillance systems in a particular area that incorporates the RFID technology .
Besides that , RFID technology is also important in the healthcare industry as it can save lives (Rapid Adoption of RFID in Healthcare , 2006) .
Dull and monotonous procedures can be removed or reduced and patients would not feel trapped or isolated and be more carefree (Rapid Adoption of RFID in Healthcare , 2006) .
For example , patients are tagged with RFID wristbands that contain information about their health conditions , medications , drug allergies and microchips that enable healthcare professionals to monitor the patients (RFID Applications in Healthcare , 2006) .
If any of the patients experience any difficulties such as breathlessness , nurses will be able to track the patient and immediately attend to him or her .
This saves time and can potentially save a life .
Since RFID automates procedures such as protecting the patients from danger , it reduces the amount of personal contacts between patients and nurses (Rapid Adoption of RFID in Healthcare , 2006) .
Information on patients' diseases and surgeries can also be obtained from the RFID wristbands .
Reports can be accessed by the healthcare professionals such as the doctors and nurses without a hassle .
Further medical treatments can be conducted if another doctor reads the reports .
However , there are arguments that are against the use of RFID technology in monitoring and tracking people and animals despite the benefits gained .
One of the arguments that have been brought up is the difficulty in reading the information provided by the RFID tags incorporated in liquids and metal products (Pandey , 2009) .
These substances may reflect the radio waves which make the information hard to read .
The RFID tags also have to be placed in proper positions , taking into account its angles and alignment in order to obtain a proper reading .
This can be quite a hassle and it requires a lot of concentration .
However , RFID tags are usually placed in an area with optimum frequency which enables the RFID readers to obtain the information contained in the tags correctly .
Active RFID tags which are tags that use batteries to increase the range of frequency of a system can be used to solve this problem .
Hence , the use of RFID technology would still be effective and beneficial to us .
In conclusion , we can see that the use of RFID technology does bring important advantages to our society .
Therefore , the use of RFID technology should be promoted and enhanced .
RFID technology provides a better security than other surveillance gadgets such as CCTV and reduces thefts in our society .
Besides that , monitoring of animals is made easy because of the versatility of the RFID tags .
Therefore , if we would like to minimise our workload , save time , ensure that we live in a safer environment and save lives , RFID technology should be used to carry out these intentions .
A Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tag is a small microchip designed for identification of the object it is attached to .
It is capable of transmitting many stored digital information to receivers via radio waves and has many applications in consumers' products (Cormode 2006) .
However , privacy issues arise when the same technology is used for tracking of human (Cormode 2006) .
When RFID and other surveillance technology are used to track children movement , we are not only invading the children privacy but also undermining their dignity (Anonymous 2005) .
Usage of RFID implants in the medical field to store patients' medical data has also been linked to increased possibility of developing cancer (Gutierrez 2008) .
With such detrimental effects on health and on human rights of privacy , usage of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned .
First of all , when RFID is used to tag and track a person , the privacy of the person being tracked is compromised .
The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy , family , home or correspondence , nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation ."
With RFID , private information of the individual other than his location can be picked up by anyone with a radio receiver and the individual with the RFID will not know who is taking the information and what private information is being stolen (Cormode 2006) .
The information may be misused for consumer profiling by the company collecting all these personal information (Cormode 2006) .
Advocates of RFID argue that the technology will prevent terrorist from entering the nation by reducing forgery of passport (US Department of Homeland Security) .
However , the United Sates Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reported that the ability of RFID to counter forgery comes from its use of encrypted digital data storage and not from its radio transmission capability .
The DHS also added that other forms of digital data storage technology such as contact chips can provide the same function against passport forgery while preventing invasion of human privacy .
Thus , RFID should not be used to track people since it infringe into human privacy .

Secondly , an article on Electronic Privacy Information Center (Anonymous 2005) highlighted that using RFID to track children movement and location not only invades their privacy but can also be very detrimental to their dignity .
The article also compared tagging our children with RFID with tagging of products in markets or tagging of livestock in farms .
From this comparison , it shows that the dignity of children is being affected by the usage of RFID to track them .
Opponents to this position argue that RFID can be used to locate the child position in the event of a kidnap (Lane 2003) .
However , Lane (2003) argues that due to the limited range of RFID , it will not serve the purpose of locating the kidnapped child well .
On top of that , Lane (2003) also pointed out that these surveillance technologies may give the children and parents a false sense of security .
Instead of teaching their children the importance of personal safety and the danger of wandering off with strangers , parents may end up relying too much on these technologies for the safety of their children .
Hence , RFID should not be used for tracking of children .
Lastly , usage of RFID implant to track patients and to store medical information of cognitive decline individual have been linked to an increased risk of developing skin cancer in areas near the implant (Gutierrez 2008) .
Although the RFID implant aids in getting medical information from these individual with lower intellect , the increase risk of cancer greatly outweighs this benefit .
Thus , usage of RFID implants for tracking of patients or for storing of medical records should be banned .
In conclusion , usage of RFID or other surveillance technology to track people not only infringe human rights of privacy and undermine the dignity of our children , it also poses a serious health issue in the case of a RFID implant .
As such , RFID or other surveillance technology to track people should be banned .

With the maturity of surveillance technology , a myriad of surveillance technologies is now widely utilized for administration , security purpose and public welfare , etc .
However , individuals of course would feel very uncomfortable when noticing a surveillance camera on an ATM machine or even in workplace .
A seemingly unavoidable debate thus arises .
Surveillance technology mainly involves the invention and application of informative , accurate and reliable modern equipment monitoring the behaviours , activities , or other changing information , usually in a clandestine manner .
Surveillance was conducted by the governments for national and social security issues underground at the very beginning  .
However , surveillance equipment has become usual and developed into various types .
The vast and most frequent surveillance is on the internet , the presumed free space .
(Daffier , Whitfield , 2008))For instance , the information awareness office , NSA , FBI in U .S . all have unauthorised access to all the data and traffic on the internet .
Billions are spent every year to develop , purchase , maintain and implement the surveillance system to intercept and analyze online information .
The tapping of telephone line by government organisations for monitor citizens and collecting miscellaneous information is also widespread in almost every country .
Another common surveillance system is that of the surveillance cameras hidden in public areas such as streets , hotels , hospital , shopping mall , bank etc , for administrative purposes or financial security .
RFID tapping is the use of small devices implanted in human body or product to identify and locate , which is already applied in some company to monitor their workers while on the job  .
Some criticize ferociously that such mass surveillance is the step towards the totalitarian world described in Jorge Orwell's 1984 .They fear the fictional Orwellian may even become true , which will be a disaster for human beings .
Some are just annoyed by this blatant way the governments work which they equal to that of treating prisoners .
Numerous civil right groups and privacy groups oppose and regard it as a severe violation of the tight of privacy and freedom .
The supporters believe that surveillance system is indispensible in indentifying and capturing terrorists and criminals , which is for public welfare  .It's also effective for administrative purpose .
They argue that in the today's context that terrorist can make use of computer software to access to others' information nowadays , why cannot governments on the behalf of the whole country .
They also point out governments didn't abuse the information at their hand since they are also monitored by people  .Additionally , surveillance create everyone a feeling of being watched , so they become self-policing , which can decrease criminal rate and save administrative expenditure( Michel Foucault ,1979)  .
Technology always evolves whatever human's interference is in the sense that every previous attempt of halting the development of technology in history proved futile .
We should exploit the technology to the most for the welfare of the whole community .
In the case of surveillance technology , we should concentrate on how to use it appropriately .
Surveillance technology usage should not be all simply banned because of its flaws , but to be regulated and optimized to serve us better in today's context .
Technological advancement has led to the invention of several surveillance technologies .
One such example is Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology .
The use of such technology has made it possible to track people and their activities through their belongings without their knowledge .
This has brought about many debates on the ethical and moral issues surrounding the use of the device (Anonymous , 2005) .
While opponents of RFID suggest that the use of RFID bring benefits such as convenience and protection to patients and children , others view it as a form of security threat and intrusion of privacy (Data Privacy & Integrity Advisory Committee , 2006) .
The use of RFID can also cause the growth of tumors if chips are implanted into the human body (Anti-chip .com , n .d) .
Thus , the use of RFID should be banned as the consequences it brings outweigh the few benefits that it provides .
Firstly , the use of RFID to track people has raised concerns on privacy issues as they are tracked without their knowledge (Data Privacy & Integrity Advisory Committee , 2006) .
Their whereabouts and activities can be constantly monitored and information shared .
It can be argued that the use of RFID tags to check on patients with Alzheimer's conditions and children may be a form of protection .
For instance , in 2006 , Verichip , the manufacturer of RFID chips for human attempted to chip 200 Alzheimer's patients from Chattanooga , Tennessee to test the effectiveness of the product (Antichip .com , n .d) .
However , this has raised a series of heated debate as it is not ethical to chip cognitively impaired individuals who are unable to give informed consent (Antichip .com , n .d) .
Hence , the use of RFID should be banned as it invades the privacy of people .
Lewan , T . (2007 , September 8) .
Chip Implants Linked to Animal Tumors .
Retrieved September 6 , 2009 , from http://www .washingtonpost .com/wp-dyn/ content/article/ 2007/09/08/AR2007090800997_pf .html
Secondly , the use of RFID to track people may provide a false sense of security (Hook , 2005) .
RFID tags can be incorporated in one's belongings such as passports and identification cards to track and identify people .
This may increase cases of skimming on personal information .
Opponents of RFID may debated that encryption can be used to limit the access of information to unauthorized people (Data Privacy & Integrity Advisory Committee , 2006) .
Furthermore , it can be argued that RFID technology would reduce delay at checkpoints and entrances which in turn improve efficiency and speed (Data Privacy & Integrity Advisory Committee , 2006) .
Nevertheless , experiments by security research firm Riscure have shown that the encrypted passport can be intercepted and excessive information is revealed to an unauthorized person , which may promote identity theft (Hasbrouck , 2006) .
Therefore , RFID should be banned as the device is flawed .
Lastly , implanting RFID chips in human can be a potential health risk .
A series of studies has shown that chip implants had induced malignant tumors in some lab mice and rats (Lewan , 2007) .
This shows that implanting chips in human may cause cancer .
However , leading cancer specialists reviewed that animal test results do not necessarily apply to humans (Lewan , 2007) .
Moreover , Verichip Corp insists that the chips are safe and has been implanted in millions of domestic pets without major problem (Lewan , 2007) .
Nevertheless , implanting RFID in human body should be banned before any cause of detrimental health effect to the individuals .
In conclusion , the use of RFID to track people should be banned as it can be a security threat and it intrudes the privacy of people .
Implanting RFID chips may also result in cancer .
The disadvantages of the use of RFID outweigh the benefits .

Surveillance technology systems are mechanisms , which can identify , monitor and track movements and data .
Research laboratories envision tools that could identify and track just about every person , anywhere -- and sound alarms when the systems encounter hazardous objects or chemical compounds .
Together these developments herald a high-tech surveillance society that is beyond previous generation imagination-- one in which virtually every advance brings benefits as well as intrusions .
However since the benefits reaped from surveillance technology overpowers the inconvenience it results in , surveillance technology should indeed be used to track people .
Surveillance technology should be used to track people to ensure national security by preventing crime .
Ever since this technology has become immensely sophisticated , real benefits have been achieved in the development of surveillance technology systems .
The most common type of surveillance technology is the security cameras .
Take for instance , the pinhole cameras in most banks machines .
These devices play a part in deterring potential criminals from carrying out their nefarious activities knowing that their images are caught on tape and maybe used for capture and prosecution .
In addition , this technology also complements the work of security personnel and thus provides added protection against sneaky terrorist attacks .
This is evident in the Singapore MRT stations that are equipped with the 24-hour camera surveillance .
Furthermore surveillance technology helps to combat threats .
This is proven during the introduction of the newly-developed Infrared Fever Screening System (IFSS) which is a useful contribution in national effort against SARS .
Some may argue that surveillance technology should not be used to track people as it may have substantial implications in privacy .
Privacy usually refers to the interest that individuals have in sustaining a personal space free from interference by other people and organizations .
It is acknowledged that the usage of surveillance technology seems to invade and violate the right to privacy .
People often think of privacy as some kind of right .
However , the concept of this right is a problematic way to define as it is very easy to get confused between legal rights on one hand and natural or moral rights on the other .
One may claim it is his right to stay in a country that is safe whereas the other may claim that it is their right not to want the practice of surveillance technology .
In such situations , it is impossible for both parties to have their rights .
One will have to give up the right to absolute privacy to reap the benefits of the rights to feel safe and secure .
Besides having absolute privacy is just an ideal .
The practice of surveillance technology is necessary for the benefit of majority as it adopted to improve our quality of life .
It will be denying more people rights if surveillance is not practiced .
For now , the public seems to find that trade-off acceptable .
Furthermore scientists around the world have intensified efforts to perfect the art of surveillance , hoping to catch villains before they strike .
This will assure public that it is worth it to allow the technology to invade in their privacy .
In conclusion , although each uptick in protection will typically come at the cost of more intrusion into the privacy of ordinary people , surveillance technology has come up with the best possible inventions to assure that this trade-off will be worth it .
Rather than not doing anything to deal with the problems we have , the implementation of such technologies should be allowed for the benefits of majority .
Surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) should not be used to track people
There are numbers of technologies by which identity of all kinds of material can be tracked .
Some advance surveillance technology like GPS and RFID can even track people's location and health status by using a tiny tag and a reader .
However , disputation rises as the issue comes to tracking of human being .
In my opinion , these surveillance technologies should not be used to track people .
First and foremost , privacy comes into our mind when we mention of being tracked all the time .
No one would like to have a pair of eyes watching him anytime or anywhere , leaving him an uncomfortable feeling .
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) has clearly stated out that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights .
Everyone should have their own rights to move freely without being monitored .
Secondly , the importance or urge to use surveillance technology to track people is subtle .
Some may argue that these technologies can keep people from danger by tracking their health status especially in some working places with high radioactive level , track someone's location in case he's kidnapped .
Workers can still have medical check regularly to ensure they are healthy as health problems wouldn't come in a sudden , it must accumulate over time .
Furthermore for parents fearing of the chance of their children being kidnapped , it's unfortunate that through electromagnetic isolation , they won't be able to track their children also .
Moreover , the children may get hurt if the kidnappers decide to remove the tag or chip implanted under the children's skin .
Besides that , the confidentiality of such data transmitted between a tag or chip and device is questionable .
Someone who has the device and the way to encrypt the code can actually have access to these data .
It's a horrible scene if someone is tracked by a person who doesn't have the authority .
Even though high security level can be developed , there will always be loopholes .
The best way to prevent the leakage of personal data is not to use it .
Last but not least , a report released by The {American Medical Association}[HYPERLINK: http://www .ama-assn .org/] (AMA) indicated that RFID devices may present physical risks to the patient .
Though they are removable , their small size allows them to migrate under the skin , making them potentially difficult to extract .
The report went on to add this warning: "RFID tags may cause electromagnetic interference , which may interfere with electrosurgical devices and defibrillators .
Finally , it has not been determined whether RFID tags might affect the efficacy of pharmaceuticals ."
In conclusion , due to the privacy , unimportance of using these technologies , confidentiality of data and health threat , surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) should not be used to track people
Over the years as technology advances , the improvement in surveillance technology such as Radio-frequency identification (RFID) and surveillance cameras has brought about the increase in usage of such technology .
Surveillance technology refers to the technology developed for observers to keep track of activities done by the observed .
Such technology is widely used on human beings in the 21st century for social , political or economical purposes .
Despite the long-running controversy over whether such technology should be used to track people due to human rights issues , it is evident that the advantages outweigh the negative impacts .
Therefore , I do not agree that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
Firstly , the use of surveillance technology such as RFID is useful in maintaining security in the country .
The use of RFID at immigration borders and checkpoints enables a country to identify suspected terrorists and keep away unwelcomed immigrants who may post a threat to the welfare of the country and her people .
( HYPERLINK "http://www .dhs .gov" http://www .dhs .gov) This will in turn help to improve and safeguard safety in the country and indirectly help in the economical aspect .
Therefore , this form of tracking of people should not be avoided .
In addition , the use of surveillance technology such as surveillance cameras to track people is believed to aid in the reduction of crime rate in the country , which will be beneficial to the society .
With the presence of surveillance cameras , potential criminals will thus think twice before they act .
This may hence deter crimes from happening .
Even though it may not be an ideal and effective way to curb criminal offenses , it can on the other hand allow authorities to work more efficiently when an incident occur .
{(Shah Alam , 2007)}[HYPERLINK: http://malaysiacrimewatch .lokety .com/closed-circuit-television-cameras-to-fight-crime-in-selangor/] The use of surveillance technology to track people , under such circumstances , has once again proved to be useful and thus should not be stopped from using it .
Despite the positive impacts of the usage of surveillance technology to track people , there are many arguments pertaining to how surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
One of the main issues will be the concern of intrusion of human rights .
When companies first started introducing the implantation of RFID chips into the body of their employees , protests were raised by both related and unrelated parties because they felt that it is clearly a violation of the privacy of one .
The workers claimed that it is a way of bereaving them from human rights when their motions are being watched around the clock .
Christian critics even claimed that such acts will lead to apocalypse as stated in the bible .
(Lewan , 2007) However , such arguments regarding religious issues and human rights are unpractical because there is no substantial evident to prove that implantation of microchips is going to lead to the end of the world , and the argument of violation of human rights is made weak with the definition of human rights being ambiguous .
Conversely , the purpose of implanting RFID chips into the employees is clear- to deny access of employees into restricted and highly confidential areas .
The concern is that should interests of the company override the right of human beings .
Therefore in this case , it is difficult to determine whether surveillance technology should or should not be used to track people .
In conclusion , with the positive impacts outweighing the negative consequences of using surveillance technology to track people , I will not agree to the statement that such technology should not be used to track people .
The use of surveillance technology such as RFID (Radio frequency identification) to track people should be banned .
Technological advances in the recent century have led to many improved methods to trace people .
Surveillance technology is widely known to do observations from a certain distance by means of electronic devices .
Technologies such as Radio-frequency identification (RFID) are used for the sole purpose of tracking people as well as products using radio waves (Syed & Mohammad , 2008) .
Most people might think that this new form of technology will be very beneficial to mankind as it ensures easy identification .
However , the increasing usage of surveillance technology to track people should be banned as it indirectly intrudes human privacy , leads to many security issues pertaining to the usage of RFID technology and questions the cost efficiency of RFID tags (Syed & Mohammad , 2008) .
RFID technology should be barred as this form of surveillance technology is still not considered totally safe for consumers .
One of the most serious threats is data theft .
As RFID tags are made to contain information , there is a very high probability of data theft by well hidden RFID scanners (Syed & Mohammad , 2008) .
Moreover , these RFID scanners are very cheap in comparison to a RFID tag .
This will eventually lead to the problem of data ownership and the information unique to an individual might be made known to other people (Syed & Mohammad , 2008) .
Another issue is the possibility of data corruption .
As RFID tags are rewritable and if they are not security locked , there exists a potential for pranksters to change the data on the tags with false information (Syed & Mohammad , 2008) .
On the contrary , some people might think that using shielding techniques on RFID tags is already an effective protection mechanism against data theft and data corruption (Syed & Mohammad , 2008) .
Although it is true that aluminium shielding can prevent hackers to steal one's data to a certain extent , it also makes transmission more difficult and might not be completely effective in preventing it (Syed & Mohammad , 2008) .
Further research needs to be done to make the shielding techniques safer for consumers .
Therefore , RFID technology should be banned for the safety of consumers .
RFID technology should also be excluded as surveillance technology to track people as it is rather costly (Syed & Mohammad , 2008) .
Each RFID reader is worth at least a thousand dollar (Syed & Mohammad , 2008) .
Those companies which have decided to use RFID technology to keep track of its workers or products have to purchase thousands of RFID readers to cover all their workplaces and factories (Syed & Mohammad , 2008) .
In addition , each RFID tag is rather expensive hence it is not practical to be used in large quantity to identify both people and products (Syed & Mohammad , 2008) .
Due to the impracticality of RFID technology , RFID technology should not be used to track people .
Though the use of RFID technology has its merits such as crime prevention , it should still be barred because the use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people not only infiltrate one's privacy; it is also not cost effective and likely to result in data theft and data loss .
Surveillance technology such as RFID to track people plays a crucial role in preventing the criminal activities as well as monitoring threats .
RFID tags can be inserted into the wristbands which can be worn by the parolees or the prisoners and cannot to be removed .
According to Taipei Times newspaper , it was claimed that the sexual assault parolees should wear the RFID tags in order to trace their whereabouts (Chang , 2006) .
During the releasing period on probation of the prisoners , there will be cases that the parolees will escape and flee to the bent so that the law enforcers could not find them .
Thus , attaching RFID tags on them can easily track them .
If they intend to run away , the police can get to know their locations and arrest them at once .
Apart from the RFID tags , GPS can be applied to investigate the criminal activities such as murder cases , robbery and serious corruption (Michael and Rose , 2007) .
Undeniable , surveillance technology to track people will lead to loss of privacy .
However , protecting the privacy in this situation is not more important than letting the offenders to violate the laws and threaten our lives .
In addition , there is another advantage of surveillance technology on protecting and tracking the children's movements .
As we know , parents nowadays always worry about their children .
However , living in the hustle and bustle of city life , many parents utilize their time to work harder to climb up the social ladder rather than supervise their kids' movements .
Hence , RFID technology is indeed a good method to help the parents to keep an eye on their children's whereabouts .
RFID tags are introduced to be sewn into children's attires or set in their wristband to track their positions and activities (Gautam , 2006) .
The importance of this surveillance technology is that it can make sure of the children's safety so that the parents can work at ease .
Although most of the children today have mobile phones , it is also possible that their mobile phones are lost or they are having difficulties to pick up their phones such as kidnapping .
If the children are being kidnapped , with the surveillance technology of RFID , the parents can track their locations .
If the children try to play truant or involving in unhealthy activities , the parents can supervise them as well .
Children have their freedom to enjoy their lives but monitoring and supervising them is also essential to ensure their safety .
Parents can talk to the children precisely why there is a need to track their movements .
In conclusion , surveillance technology's advantages outweigh its disadvantages .
Surveillance technology should be used in a correct way to improve human's life and not to lead to dehumanization .
So , I do not agree that there should be a ban in using surveillance technology to track people .
Firstly , surveillance technology may threaten personal security by enabling identity thieves , stalkers and other criminals to commit "contactless" crimes against victims who won't immediately know they've been violated (Consumer Watchdog , 2009) .
Recently , Americans are told to use Radio- Frequency Identification or RFID-embedded identity documents when they are travelling between countries such as the United States , Canada , Mexico , Bermuda and the Carribean (Lewan , 2009) .
In February 2005 , when the State Department (US) asked for public comment on the implementation of RFID in passport booklets , of the 2 ,335 comments received , 98 .5 percent were negative , with 86 percent expressing security or privacy concerns , the department reported in an October 2005 notice in the Federal Register (Lewan , 2009) .
Indeed , the fear of losing security is a distressing concern among the society .
Secondly , surveillance technology poses a risk to personal privacy and healthcare .
"Tracking devices such as online behavioural tracking systems can be used to target vulnerable consumers for high-price loans , bogus health cures and other potentially harmful products and services ," said Susan Grant , director of Consumer Protection at Consumer Federation of America (Consumer Watchdog , 2009 , para .9) .
Nowadays electronic information from consumers is "collected , compiled and sold" (Consumer Watchdog , 2009 , para .2) without reasonable safeguards and therefore poses a threat to the exposure of private matters of consumers that may lead to abuse of such information for unethical benefits or intentions .
Some may argue that such tracking systems can be beneficial especially in providing security measurement and protection , for example the implantation of tiny radio tracking beacons in children (Gargano , Gilmore , Pace , Weinstein , 1997) .
This measure is to be seen as an effort to protect the children in case of child murder or kidnapping are to occur (Gargano et al . , 1997) .
However , the motivation for the beacons may change on the part of the parents as the children grow older and begin to learn to protect themselves .
Parents who insist their teens in wearing radio beacons may cause the teens (those who oppose) to refuse the requirement and subsequently select other unpleasant options , including trying to remove the (implanted) beacon themselves (Petersen , 2001) .
As a result , this is how teens' privacy and growth are affected negatively when parents applied tracking devices on them .
Julie Petersen , author of Understanding of Surveillance Technologies (2001 , p5-48) , stated this comment in her book , "Researching this book has given me concerns that we may be moving into a not-too-distant future in which newborn infants are implanted with radio tracking devices , without their knowledge or consent , to 'ensure their safety' from wandering or kidnapping .
These actions may be well-intentioned initially but may subsequently be used to curtail freedom of choice and movement during their teenage years and beyond ."
Unfortunately the use of surveillance technology in tracking people may have higher probability in affecting a person's social well-being as well as intruding his privacy even when it may be well- intentioned at first .
In conclusion , the use of surveillance technology for the purpose of tracking people should be banned as it not only received negative response from the public community because of its potential threat to personal security , it may also intrude one's privacy and may jeopardize one's personal healthcare and social well-being .
As a type of surveillance technology , Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) has been widely used in our lives .
The use of RFID to track people is drawing increasing attention and has caused many conflicts .
Advocators suggest that using RFID to conduct social control and suspects tracking can benefit the whole society .
However , RFID is in fact not as ideal as they think .
On the contrary , it raises serious problems on invasion of privacy and health issues .
Hence , using RFID to track people should be banned .
An important reason why the use of RFID to track people should be banned is because the abuse of RFID risks the invasion of privacy .
On one hand , some tracking are conducted without people's awareness and permission .
For instance , in an Oklahoma Wal-Mart store , RFID tags were hidden in Procter & Gamble Lipfinity lipstick on shelves without declaration .
When customers interacted with the lipsticks , they were not aware that they were being observed by the Procter & Gamble executives (Albrecht and McIntyre 2004) .
Likewise , many companies use RFID tagged product to track consumers' behaviors and collect information without their knowledge and consent , which seriously invades consumers' privacy .
On the other hand , although in some cases people are informed , they are still under the risk of losing privacy .
It is because within a certain distance , anyone who has the reading device is able to read RFID tags .
Thus , besides the real tracking conductors , criminals can also take advantages of RFID to achieve their criminal intent .
A security expert Bruce Schneier said that "When RFID chips are embedded in your ID cards , your clothes , your possessions , you are effectively broadcasting who you are to anyone within range .
The level of surveillance possible , not only by the government but by corporations and criminals as well , will be unprecedented .
There simply will be no place to hide" (Sieberg D 2006) .
In short , since the abuse of RFID to track people leads to the invasion of human privacy , its use should be banned .
Another concern about using RFID to track people is the health problems .
Research has shown that implantable RFID chips caused cancer in animal and they may also cause cancer in humans .
In addition , research also showed that the {inflammation}[HYPERLINK: http://www .naturalnews .com/inflammation .html] caused by surgical implantation of a foreign object can increase the instance of tumor development (Jean 2007) .
Concerning these health issues , it is immoral to ask people implant RFID chips and meanwhile let them take the risk of having disease .
Therefore , the use of RFID to track people should be banned .
In conclusion , using RFID to track people not only raises the possibilities of privacy invasion , but also causes health problems .
Instead of benefitting from it , people bear many fear and risk of it .
Thus , although using RFID to conduct tracking may be helpful in some aspects , compared with the disadvantages of it , the use of RFID to track people should be banned .
Lastly is the prominent impact in civil society .
If RFID chip is implanted to all members of society , it will give out a lot of advantages such as we can track missing people , missing family members .
Even more , we can track and identify the lost casualties in airplane accidents and natural disasters faster , effectively and efficiently so that more casualties can still be found in living condition .
Some party may argue about the privacy matter of the use of this technology .
In this case , privacy matter can be assured by applying password , encrypter or decoder in the next generation of RFID devices .
It is just the same case with the use of bank account and ATM card pin which has been broadly trusted by all of bank customer .
Another issue concerning the medical safety aspect of implanting the chip in human body may state that RFID tags may cause electromagnetic interference which may interfere with electrosurgerical devices and defibrillators .
However , the American Medical Association report mentioned that it has not been determined whether RFID tags may affect the efficacy of pharmaceuticals .
Furthermore , this report also stated that RFID tags could promote the frequent access for the patient to their medical information and increase the continuity and coordination of care which resulting reduction many kind of medical error like adverse drugs event .
In conclusion , the use of surveillance technology such as RFID and GPS to track people should not be banned since the advantageous is much greater than the disadvantageous in many sites of human life such as economy aspect by increasing the level of working efficiency and broaden exploration area , civil security aspect by lowering the level of criminal cases , military aspect by facilitating in tracing the kidnapped soldier , civil society aspect by helping the family to search the missing family members , improving the efficiency in searching and identifying the casualties of mass accidents or natural disasters  , and facilitating the more frequent access of medical information for the patients .
The use of surveillance technology started as early as 1969 , where cameras were installed in the New York City Municipal Building (Roberts , 2005) .
It helps to "identify , monitor and track movements and data ."
(Bogonikolos , 1999) .
The usage of this technology has also brought about many controversies on privacy as a basic human right , the lack of control over who can view the information of those who are being tagged , and lastly , the psychological impact it has on the individual and the society .
In my point of view , I agree that surveillance technology should not be used to track people to a large extent .
First of all , there is insufficient control over the people who have access to the surveillance technology .
For example , anyone with a RFID sensor will be able to read and/or detect an individual who has the RFID tag implanted inside him (Sieberg , 2006) .
People with access to surveillance technology can use their access to find out sensitive information about others for immoral use .
Though some may argue that surveillance technology is important for national security , it can also cause a threat to national security .
This is due to the fact that anyone , including criminals and hackers , can gain access to the nation's confidential information , hence threatening the nation's livelihood .

Is RFID tracking you ?

The use of RFID to track people should not be banned
Nowadays there is a fierce debate over the use human implant Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) to track people .
Some people say that the use of RFID invades people's privacy; others maintain that the use of RFID can bring us a lot of benefits .
In my point of view , the use of RFID should not be banned with the following reasons .
Firstly , it is undeniable that RFID is very useful in daily life .
RFID is more efficient and convenient in tracking early released criminals than other surveillance technology as it simplifies the locating process .
In addition , with this technology , parents can easily find their lost children and doctors can easily find elderly people who suffer from degenerative brain conditions CITATION Dav06 \l 2052 (Wood , 2006) .
Hence , it is not necessary to ban the use of RFID which can bring us so much convenience .
To sum up , RFID is a useful technology and like each technology , it has its pros and cons .
The question lies in the appropriate use of RFID .
Since RFID has so many advantages that bring us efficiency and convenience , and the negative effects RFID might bring about such as invasion of privacy could be offset , the use of RFID should not be banned .
In today's world , surveillance technology has been deployed for various purposes .
One of the most debated usages of this technology is to monitor and track people via the surveillance camera and the RFID (radio-frequency identification) .
Critics have argued that this has inevitably denied the individuals their rights to privacy (Stanley and Steinhardt 2003) , and thus should not be used to track people .
However , the benefits of surveillance should not be downplayed .
This essay shall elaborate on how surveillance technology will ensure one's safety and also on its contribution to the overall improvements in healthcare services for the population by monitoring them .
The security of a country and the safety of its citizens have always been the top priority of every government .
Memories of the terrorist attacks happened around the world will always serve as a stark reminder to everyone that a lapse in security will result in heavy casualties .
One of the ways to prevent these from happening is to make use of surveillance technology such as surveillance camera and the RFID .
Surveillance cameras installed at strategic areas will ensure that suspicious characters could be filtered out by the security personnel for checks while RFID tags on prisoners would ensure that they do not escape (Swedberg 2005) and pose a danger to the public .
As one would remember , the escape of the terrorist Mas Selamat in Singapore had threatened the security of the city and the neighbouring countries .
Deployment of large number of troops to capture him was futile until he was arrested by the Malaysian police one year later .
If a RFID tag had been used , the terrorist would not be able to escape easily .
Although one may argued that terrorist attacks still occur even with the use of surveillance camera , one should also note that the recordings would enable the police to identify the terrorists after the attack and conduct a swift operation to arrest them (Quek 2008) before they could plan and carry out their next mission .
Besides that , having security cameras around would always serve as deterrence to potential criminals (Quek 2008) .
Thus , surveillance technology should be deployed to monitor people , especially the terrorists .

Khaw: Treat hospital bed shortage with care .
[Internet][cited 2009 October 2] .
Available from: http://www .channelnewsasia .com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/278291/1/ .ht ml
In Singapore , hospital bed shortages have been a perennial problem for the government .
The high occupancy rate would mean that more healthcare professionals are needed to look after the patients .
In order to improve the overall efficiency of the medical team , Tan Tock Seng Hospital has rolled out RFID in 2007 to monitor more than 1 ,200 patients (Friedlos 2009) .
The benefits of RFID includes locating the patients easily for tests and administering of medicine , and a lower response time of the housekeeping department in clearing the bed once a patient is discharged , which will then reduce an individual's waiting time for a bed (Friedlos 2009) .
This surveillance technology has allowed the healthcare professionals to perform their jobs efficiently and improve the well-being of the patients .
However , as the population continues to age , elderly who are not seriously ill might have to be discharged and nursed their injuries or illnesses at home or in a nursing home (Tan 2007) .
In order not to compromise their health , RFID should be utilized to monitor them (Broache 2007) .
This will not only ensure that they are being looked after by a dedicated healthcare team but it will also alleviate the problem of bed shortages .
Hence , the usage of surveillance technology to track people should not be prohibited .
Critics have long been condemning the use of surveillance technology on humans .
Their disapprovals for such technology grow stronger over the years since the terrorist attack on the World Trade Centre on 11th September 2001 .
They believed that many countries have increased unnecessary surveillance on the pretext of monitoring the terrorists (Stanley and Steinhardt 2003) .
This has caused the loss of individuals' privacy .
I must admit that erosion of rights to privacy has happened .
However , one must weigh the importance between privacy and security before denouncing the efforts by the governments on surveillance .
As mentioned in the previous paragraph , the surveillance camera could enable the police to identify the terrorists easily after the attack and arrest them .
A good example would be the apprehension of terrorists behind the London bombing with the help of surveillance technology (Quek 2008) .
Hence , surveillance technology should not be ruled out completely .
In conclusion , although the individuals' rights to privacy have been eroded with the increased surveillance , we should continue the usage of the technology because the security of a country and the safety of its citizens are always of utmost importance to everyone .
Besides that , deployment of RFID could benefit the aging population by ensuring that everyone is being looked after by medical professionals without overstretching the whole healthcare facilities .
Hence , surveillance technology should be allowed to track people .

Coming up: smart CCTV ? .

Since the explosion of technology during the last few decades , there has been a new method to track people , which is surveillance technology .
However , whether using of this technology to track people is acceptable or not has always been a big concern .
People who think that surveillance technology should not be used to track people claim that it invade the privacy right of people .
However , surveillance technology , if is used appropriately , can benefit our life so much that it should not be banned .
Firstly , one undeniable advantage of surveillance technology is it might help us to protect people and their belongings .
Simple systems such as cameras or voice recording can be used to observe shopping malls , buildings and other public places .
It might help to maintain the security of those places as well as find out if there is any robber or thief , thus may reduce the crime rate (The Economist print edition , 2008) .
Cameras are usually used in high security or restricted access workplaces to protect these places .
Moreover , police can also use surveillance technology to track potential criminals , for instance , to supervise a person who was imprisoned in the past for a short time to ensure that he won't commit a crime again .
Surveillance technology helps us much in follow dangerous criminals such as gangsters , mafia chief .
Although people who oppose the use of this technology may claim that it would be years before they can pick a terrorist out of a crowd (Yang , 2005) , some intelligent system now can learn the context in which behavior is probably threatening (The Economist print edition , 2008) .
Hence , we may easily filter the suspects and more concentrate on their acts to know if they are really criminals .
Furthermore , busy parents can use simple surveillance devices to keep an eye on their children .
A small tag or camera will give parents information about their children every period of time , thus they know that they are safe .
It also prevents children from being kidnapped or be injured in accidents because their parents would know immediately whenever they are in danger .
Hospitals may apply surveillance system to observe patients (Anonymous , 2004) .
Since doctors and nurses are not able to be with patients all the time , cameras and other surveillance devices will record their condition and alert when it become worse .
Obviously , the feeling of being tracked will make people feel uncomfortable but the safety of us is more precious .
For instance , if you get lost or have a serious accident that you can not call for help , your friends and family could not find you quickly if they do not know your place .
In this situation , surveillance technology is needed , as GPS has been used for years to find lost people .
Furthermore , new surveillance devices are very sophisticated that users won't feel that they are followed .
Thirdly , the use of surveillance technology can make our life more convenient .
Tags and chips implanted in human's body can be use as smart identity cards .
When a person gets off a plane , he goes through a special door , and then the custom-house officer will know all the necessary information of him immediately .
This will save our time as we do not have to spend hours waiting to check-in or check-out .
In some cities , combinations of biometrics and surveillance for access control or checking time and attendance have been used recently (Yang , 2005) .
It not only used for the purpose of security but for the convenient of residents since they do not have to use keys or worry about thieves .
However , there is a concern that implant chips can hurt people and lead to some unexpected consequences .
Actually , not all type of surveillance use this method since we can use cards , cameras and other modern devices instead .
In case we have to use implant chips , it will be designed and made carefully that it will not hurt the users .
Another worry in the use of this technology that whenever a hacker can get in the system , users are threatened as their personal information can be revealed (Zetter , 2009) .
However , systems are made to be able to prevent hackers as well as store the information safely .
The privacy of tracked people will be maintained as long as possible .
In conclusion , surveillance technology benefits our life in many ways that we should not ban it .
Though the consequence that people will be tracked seems unacceptable , the safe and convenience in life for humans is more important .
As long as we use it appropriately , surveillance technology will not have bad influences in our life but make it better .
Surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) should not be used to track people (e .g .
human implants and RFID tags on people or products) .
Nowadays surveillance technology is growing at a rapid speed and surveillance equipments can be found in many common places such as supermarkets , schools and airport terminal .
Surveillance technology is actually used to monitor and keep track of an individual's activities , behavior and data .
People are actually being observed from a distance by these surveillance technology equipments such as CCTV cameras and GPS tracking devices or being tracked by the means of microchip , a RFID device which using radio waves .
It has been proven that surveillance technology can be beneficial to mankind in terms of deterring crimes and terrorism , monitoring employees and improving patient's welfare .
Thus , surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) should not be banned .
First of all , surveillance technology should be used as it helps in eradicate crimes and to identify the faces of terror from a miles away .
This surveillance technology equipments are installed in buses , common places or schools and with the constant video monitoring , detailed evidence of any suspicious movement or criminal activity can be assessed .
Moreover , an individual is less likely to commit a crime if he knows that he is being watched .
If potential criminals aware of this fact ,there is a high possibility that crimes can be greatly deterred .
In addition , this surveillance technology protect a country's safety and security from terrorist attacks .
For instance ," as a direct result of the September 11 terrorist attacks , United States government and law enforcement officials have implemented surveillance technologies to deter future terrorist attacks(Jim ,2009) .
Therefore , surveillance technology should be used since it put criminals and terrorists away and protect the society .
Furthermore , employees in working places can be monitored by means of surveillance technology and it have plenty of advantages .
Implementing this technology properly can help improve security in working places .
Examples of devices that used are entrance and exit cameras , internal and outdoor cameras and cash register and counter cameras (Bill ,2006) .
The presence of surveillance cameras can prevent thefts in the company because employees are less likely to steal company products as they fully aware that they are being watched by unblinking cameras which can provide evidences .
However , opponents of surveillance technology argues that it invades an individual's privacy .
They did not realize that with a clear understanding of where and how security cameras can be installed , potential privacy intrusion can be avoided (Lynn ,2006) .
Hence , surveillance tools must be used in every working places to improve the security and as well as the employee's good behavior .
In conclusion , surveillance technology such as RFID should be used to track people since it helps in deterring crimes and terrorism , monitoring employees and improving welfare of patients .
If surveillance technology is banned , safety of the society and the country's security will be under a big threat .
Criminals and terrorists tend to commit more crimes since they are not being watched and there is no concrete evidence to put them behind the bars .
Thus , to ensure our continued freedom , surveillance technology must be commonly used  .
Surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned
With the help of surveillance technology , crime rate can be reduced and prevented .
For instance , the installment of Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) in the multi-storey parking lots of a building will enable the security guards to monitor the situation and to pick up on suspicious behavior .
Hence , the officers on duty can take immediate action to prevent a crime from happening .
Detractors from my point of view will argue that too much money has been pumped in to the installation of CCTV and doubt the effectiveness of it (Privacy International , 1997) .
However , in a recent study conducted in Hartlepool , United Kingdom , it was shown that crime rate has reduced by 26% from 2004-2007 after installing CCTV at certain areas (SaferHartlepool , 2009) .
Thus , surveillance technology can enhance security and therefore should not be banned .
Another reason this technology should not be banned is the improvement it will bring about in the healthcare sector .
For instance , it can be used to monitor and locate patients in the hospital .
The movement of patients can be tracked and signal will be sent out in an emergency (Kanellos , 2004) .
Thus , prompt action can be taken to prevent undesirable events from happening .
Some may argue that implanting RFID chip may cause physical side effect .
However , according to Applied Digital , a leading provider of identification and security technology , an estimated 1000 chips had been implanted in humans with no harmful physical side effects (Kanellos , 2004) .
Thus , the use of RFID can benefit us in the healthcare sector by bringing about assurance in knowing that patients are well tracked and monitored .
Biometrics is used to identify a person based on his physical or behavioral traits .
This can be done by analyzing finger prints , recognizing facial features and scanning of iris .
Hence , biometrics which is part of surveillance technology can be used for authentication purposes (Smith , 2009) as for instance , the biometric passport which can be used to prevent thefts identity and also to conduct automatic immigration clearances .
Critics of this objection claim that our security will be at risk as the embedded secret codes can be cloned and thus allowing the hackers to enter the country illegally .
While it is true that such an event may occur , but with the advancement of technology and tighter regulations , this problem can be rectified .
Therefore , the use of biometrics passport will not only increase efficiency but also enhance security at the same time .
All in all , surveillance technology can help to improve the welfare of society by offering a tool for crime prevention , improving the healthcare system and also identifying of a person .
Hence , with the myriad advantages it can bring us , surveillance technology should not be banned .
Surveillance technologies have been around us all the while .
However , it was only after the September 11 incident that people are now paying more attention towards surveillance technologies and the issues involved .
To keep surveillance is to keep watch on someone , some group , or something .
There are various ways that surveillance can be carried out , such as through security cameras that we commonly know as closed-circuit television (CCTV) , 'Echelon' global signal eavesdropping system that the United States' National Security Agency uses , and radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags .
While these technologies should be continued for tracking of people , we should approach these technologies cautiously and with the proper restrictions to prevent misuse if necessary .
Surveillance technology such as RFID should be used to track people because of the convenience it can bring about .
RFID tags are paper thin and thumbnail size computer chips that emit radiowaves for communication .
It can read as well as withhold biometric information such as fingerprint and photograph of the individual .
When this technology is embedded into passports , it can even record travel history .
Using these new passports could cut short the time spent for identity verification and recording when crossing the borders .
This will improve the efficiency of custom clearing process , thus saving time for travelers and improving the overall image of the country .
Surveillance technology can be a form of deterrence for potential criminals , or as a form of evidence when a crime is committed .
Drivers will be more conscious of their speed limits when speed cameras are around; shoplifters will think twice before committing when there are various security cameras in the shopping mall .
This has always been the primary means of crime deterrence to maintain a safe and secure society .
When deterrence failed , surveillance cameras would have captured the crime process , thus providing undeniable evidence that could be used to identify and convict the offender (Long , 2008) .
Thus , surveillance technology should be used to track people as it is not only a way to deter crimes , but also to ensure justice .
Some might argue that using surveillance cameras to record evidence is already in itself proving that the "presence of cameras had absolutely zero deterrence value" (Long , 2008) as the criminal still commits the crime even with the knowledge of being watched .
However , we have to understand that there is no certainty in deterrence .
In fact , crime rates would probably be a lot higher if there are totally no surveillance cameras around .
There are others who feel that there is an invasion of privacy when there is unquestioned tracking of people .
Individuals seem to have lost the right to decide whether they want to be monitored .
Phone calls could be tapped; and even along the common streets of orchard road , there are surveillance cameras lurking around .
There seems be a loss of personal space for individuals .
Furthermore , identity theft has been proven to occur easily for RFID technology (Expanding RFID Use Raises Privacy Concerns , 2009) where the signals can be read at a distance away from the subject , without proper consent .
Even with further encryption security , this has been proven to be easily overcome .
Thus , sensitive information of individuals could be lost unknowingly , and the idea of 'personal space' is slowly becoming obscure .
There are benefits that surveillance technologies could bring us .
In fact , it probably plays quite an integral part in our society .
This is shown by how common it is within an individual's everyday life .
In the process , there seems to be a loss of personal privacy .
However , the benefits of using surveillance technology outweigh the limitations as they could be improved with advancement in technology in the future .
Hence , the use of surveillance technology to track people should be continued .
Surveillance technologies have become increasing popular in recent years .
Types of surveillance technologies include Cameras (CCTV) , Face- Recognition , Biometrics , RFID (radio-frequency identification) and even Cookies in web browsers (Jeffrey A 2009) .
There is no denying that surveillance technologies that are extremely useful with wide ranges of uses from monitoring traffic to the detection and prevention of crime (Jeffrey A 2009) .
However , the use of surveillance technologies to track people without prior consent will deny the person of privacy which he or she is entitled to .
Therefore surveillance technology should not be used to track people useless with prior permission .
Examples on how tracking people can compromise privacy can be drawn from the surveillance technology , RFID .
One of the most common uses of RFID is for inventory management .
Positive uses of RFID in inventory management include tracking items with toxic substances , tracking manufactured products through the supply chain and tracking pharmaceuticals to point of sale to ensure proper handling through the supply chain (Alan RP 2005) .
However , the main concern is when the product reaches the consumer .
There are three possible situations where privacy could be compromised , which are the pre-sale stage , during the sales transaction and post-sale stage .
In the pre-sale stage , when a RFID tagged item is examined by a customer , the store can monitor customers' actions .
Profiling and monitoring can then be used to track individuals and their choice of products (Alan RP 2005) .
Although this may just be the store trying to use of RFID systems to try to increase sales , it violates the personal privacy of the customer (Alan RP 2005) .
One example would be the company Prada , which uses RFID systems in dressing rooms to suggest accessories (Alan RP 2005) .
When the sales transaction takes place , the store can permanently store all personal information about the customer , including credit cards and telephone numbers and associate it with the specific item (Alan RP 2005) .
These information could then be used for many purposes like marketing activities and personal profiling based on past purchases (Alan RP 2005) .
Post-sales monitoring using RFID also poses a threat to privacy .
The RFID tags used remains attached on items even after they are purchased , which could subsequently be read when they encounter an RFID transceiver anywhere (Alan RP 2005) .
With the information , it is possible to identify the person as well as personal information such as shopping records and credit history (Alan RP 2005) .
Invasive custom marketing activities could be developed through reading of tagged items and in the worst case scenario , individual movements could be tracked by just being in possession of the items (Alan RP 2005) .
However , it does not mean that the use of RFID for tracking people will compromise privacy .
There is currently a program called NEXUS which allows U .S . and Canadian citizens to register their fingerprints , photo , and other personal data and , if approved , receive a card with an RFID tag (Alan RP 2005) .
When individuals wish to travel between the U .S . and Canada , the RFID tag allows them to be cleared though inspection in less than five seconds (Alan RP 2005) .
Not only is it convenience , because the individual already gave prior permission , it is not consider to be a breach of privacy .
In conclusion , as useful as surveillance technologies such as RFID may be , unless prior permission is given by the individual , they should not be used to track people as it is considered a breach of privacy .
With the development of science and technology , human beings are capable of tracking products , animals or even other people by using RFID (Radio-frequency identification) .
This has sparked a heated controversy (RFID-everything on RIFD , 2005) whether the surveillance , especially RFID , should be banned or not .
Although many people argue that RFID violates human rights and may raise the illegal tracking of RFID tags (RFID-everything on RIFD , 2005) , its advantages still outweigh disadvantages overwhelmingly , as RFID can not only protect human beings' possessions and security , but also enhance the efficiency of business' operation period .
Therefore , surveillance technology should not be banned in our community .
There are three main aspects that RFID will benefit human beings .
Firstly , it will contribute to ensuring the security of society , like "airport security , airline security and cruise ship security" (Greene , 2004) .
It is because RFID is able to efficiently detect terrorists and criminals who hide drugs in their bodies , all objects made by mental , all explosive devices and so on .
In this way , public's benefits are protected as much as possible .
Besides , in school , RFID can assist officers in checking people who enter and leave school so that they are capable of taking students' attendance and ensuring no unauthorized people come in simultaneously .
Hence , RFID makes great contribution to our society .
The second advantage of RFID is that it may save operation costs and gain more profits for companies .
For example , analysts from Sanford C . Bernstein (Radio Frequency Identification Technology , n .d .) say that the world's biggest retailer , Wal-Mart , saves as much as 8 .35 billion dollars per year by applying RFID in its physical counts of inventory .
It is because RFID helps to reduce Wal-Mart's operation period overwhelmingly .
It takes only five minutes to finish the job which human beings need more than one day to do .
Therefore , RFID is a good assistant for companies , as well as our society .
However , those who disagree with the use of RFID express their concerns about the illicit tracking of RFID tags (Radio-Frequency Identification , 2008) .
Admittedly , such actions may result in the abuse of tracking people and products by some hackers or criminals for bad purposes .
Nevertheless , the advantages of surveillance technology still outweigh its side effects .
For instance , it can help police to find missing people and pets; to trace phone calls and locate the places of potential criminals; and to secure the safety of each country by applying it for the passports and airports in order to prevent stowaways and criminals from both coming in and going out (Radio-Frequency Identification , 2008) .
Moreover , if government enhances the degree of secrecy of the surveillance technology , these people with evil thoughts may have a hard time to approach it .
As a result , the abuse of surveillance technology may not be a big issue .
In conclusion , the surveillance technology , RFID , should not be banned as it is able to benefit our society significantly , not only on the economics aspect , but also the human beings' security .
Therefore , surveillance , such as RFID , should be used in people's daily life .

RFID is an advanced technology using electrical objects implanting on products , animals , and even human for the purpose of surveillance through radio waves .
It has been applied widely to many areas: passport , transport payments , animal surveillance , product tracking in companies , and even human tracking .
However , the aspects of human are always controversial topics for many years .
People argue that the use of RFID for tracking people should be banned , and in my perspective , I totally agree with that statement .
The first obvious reason for banning the use of RFID to track people is the privacy .
Since human is different from animals , as well as unemotional objects , they have some basic human rights .
The most important right is the right for keeping some privacy .
The use of RFID is effective for animal tracking , but it "seems to cross a line when technology that's used for inventory management or keeping track of pets is then placed in human beings" (Sieberg ,2006) .
When using RFID for surveillance for finding crime , for instance , the official authorities you have to look at lots of sensitive and even intimate information .
The individual , aware or not aware of this using , will have his serious loss of privacy .
The second reason is the degree of security of using RFID for tracking people .
Although in a government system , the information obtained from RFID is kept , there is still a chance for hackers to read the card information and exploit the human's medical status or steal the personal identities , for example .
Through this , the hackers can assault the individual's life , or more seriously , exploit those information to assault the government and military systems .
This places our society in extreme danger .
Finally , though some may argue that RFID is a scientific progress , and we should not hinder it , the use of RFID on human may make RFID a useless , or even dangerous , technology .
Let's remind us of inventing nuclear weapons and creating wars everywhere .
Is that a real scientific progress ?
In conclusion , I advocate the ban of RFID to track people .
Using RFID is like a double knife .
It is advantageous , but do not go too far , or it will kill ourselves .
The word 'Surveillance' originally came from France where it means 'to watch over' in French .
Surveillance technology has a history dated back as early as 1965 , where the first closed circuit television (CCTV) was used in the police force in the United States in public places (Roberts , 2005) .
The definition of surveillance technology is the ongoing monitoring of people or information to detect changes in trends or distribution to initiate investigative or control measures (The Joint Comission , 2006) .
The two most common and effective types of surveillance today is the global positioning system (GPS) and the radio frequency identification (RFID) .
The benefits of surveillance technology conspicuously outweigh the concerns about human privacy issues that are so often brought up by human rights bodies and the law (Michael & Rose , 2007) .
This is because this intelligent technology aids in crime prevention , social control and threat monitoring .
Surveillance technology helps prevent crime .
The presentation of crime across the media for the past 30 years via television news , drama series , reality televisions , etc . , has indicated that crime is a feature of modern life , and the government cannot protect the public by itself (Knepper , Doak , & Shapland , 2009) .
It is therefore important to allow surveillance technology to work hand-in-hand with the police force to overcome criminal puzzles without the redundant concerns over human privacy .
For example , GPS 24/7 continuous real-time tracking of and individual , and is considered several times more powerful than the traditional visual surveillance often exercised by the police force (Michael & Rose , 2007) .
According to FOXNews .com on the 21st Of May , 2006 , the authorities can now track dangerous sex offenders with GPS without keeping them in prison at taxpayer's expenses , even after serving their time .
In 1999 , the murder case of Valiree by William 'Brad' Jackson was solved with concrete evidence when the police force obtained a warrant to install a GPS transmitter on his truck and successfully tracked his movement to certain places which led to the discovery of the victim's body .
While there are opponents raising the issue of invasion of privacy towards an individual and also the trustworthiness of the law enforcement personnel to act appropriately , justification can be done by the effectiveness of surveillance technology in bringing justice (Michael & Rose , 2007) .
It would be absurd to compromise the credibility of tracking and bringing a criminal case into light just to preserve the basic individual right to privacy .

Surveillance technology also aids social control .
RFID-tagging in certain commercial products has been widely practiced in the retail stores in the United States , namely Wal-Mart , for the purpose of convenient inventory tracking .
Also , RFID chips are being implanted or tagged onto products to monitor the habits of consumers .
The tracking of a consumer who makes regular purchase of a certain product can be identified and it can be deduced whether the amount of purchase over a period of time is within an acceptable range or at a threatening level .
This type of use of RFID is called 'item-level' , which may raise consumer privacy concerns .
RFID- tagging is able to track consumer behavior , which is digitally recorded for only the company's use and also other parties upon valid requests , such as affiliated companies and even to the federal government (Hariton , Lawford , & Palihapitiya , 2006) .
For example , excessive purchase of cigarettes may explain the cause of certain health hazard such as respiratory disease of a consumer .
Quick access to the lifestyle of a patient helps in effective diagnosis of the patient's diseases in the future .
Furthermore , surveillance technology can assist in monitoring potential threats .
In a more specific context , monitoring is crucial to suppress transnational crime .
Strict measures have been taken to detect and anticipate any potential terrorist attack .
Since the 9/11 incident , the United States has been keen to negotiate treaties with foreign countries on Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA): a body which ensures individuals cannot evade prosecution simply because the evidence of prosecution is located abroad (Michael & Rose , 2007) .
With the speed and accuracy of GPS to track any suspects related to terrorism and crime , it is crucial to identify any formidable plans or plots before disaster strikes , something which could save lives and properties .
So what are the moral and ethical issues behind surveillance practice ?
We cannot estimate the power of data accessibility , and this greatly challenges the established basic individual right to privacy .
The balance between personal privacy and national security lies on a fine line (Michael & Rose , 2007) .
However , the importance of the latter often outweighs the sacrifice of individual interest , with conditions that surveillance is done within the expectations of the people .
For instance , a person should not expect full privacy in public places such as the streets or a shopping place .
In conclusion , surveillance technology to track people should not be banned due to the benefits it bestows: such as the prevention of crime , detection of danger , as well as the monitoring social behavior .
With every advent of technology , there are always cons trailing the pros that it brings .
We should seek credible solutions for issues which arise instead of prohibiting an intelligent invention of mankind .
Intelligence can never be confined; banning can therefore never stop intelligence .

The history of video surveillance -- from VCR's to eyes in the sky .
Retrieved October 1 , 2009 , from http://www .video- surveillance-guide .com/history-of-video-surveillance .htm .
Over the years , surveillance technology has advanced drastically and it has slowly integrate into our daily life where video cameras can be commonly seen monitoring us in shopping centre , workplaces and residential areas .
The monitoring of one's movements and activities is introduced to ensure our safety and prevent crimes .
However it has also raised concerns that we are monitored just like criminal .
Thus , it violates one's privacy and hinders one's freedom .
This also indicates a loss in mutual trust within individuals .
In addition , surveillance technology that appears beneficial in protecting our safety actually has limitations in crime detection and prevention .
Therefore , since the disadvantages of surveillance technology outweigh its benefits , it should not be use to track people .
Firstly , the use of surveillance technology threatens our human right of privacy .
Surveillance technology allow others to monitor our daily activities and record these data in the form of CCTV (closed-circuit television) images , communication records and content enabling them to have access to our personal information .
(Ball , K . , Lyon , D . , Wood , D .M . , Norris , C . & Raab , C . 2006) .
This information can be misused by individuals with ill intention , using it to manipulate us for their own benefit .
In addition , according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights Article 12 , it states that "no one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy , family , home or correspondence" (United Nations , 2009) .
Thus , since surveillance technology infringes our privacy , it should not be used to track people .
Secondly , surveillance technology breaks social relationship and family bonds due to the loss of trust .
For instance , some employers would install surveillance monitors in their workplaces to track the activities of their employee (Ball , K . & et al .
2006) .
This would subject the employees to constant fear of committing mistakes if they are aware that they had been monitored , it could diminish their moral which in return affect their productivity and efficiency at work .
Furthermore , parents would resort in using webcams and GPS systems to check on their children' activities (Ball , K . & et al .
2006) instead of trying to communicate with their children to understand the friends they mixed with and to find out their whereabouts .
This monitoring action causes a loss of mutual trust between the parent and child which is a foundation to build a strong family bond .
Hence , the use of surveillance technology to track people should be banned as it creates suspicion between individuals causing the loss of trust .
(Ball , K . & et al .
2006) .
On the other hand , supporters of surveillance technology state that surveillance technology plays an important role in crime detection and prevention thus maintaining the country's security and prevent terrorist attacks .
However , in reality surveillance technology is inefficient in crime detection and prevention providing minimal protection for us .
Surveillance technology usually only focuses on tracking down criminals after the crime was committed and the damage was done .
For instance , a Metropolitan Police report stated that only one crime was solved by the 1000 CCTV cameras placed across London revealing that CCTV has minimum effectiveness but contributes to massive expenses .
(BBC News , 2009) .
Hence , since surveillance technology is ineffective in crime detection and prevention , it should not be used to track people .
In conclusion , it is evident that the use of surveillance technology to track people should be banned as it not only threatens one's privacy inhibiting them from exercising freedom but the use of surveillance technology also poses unknown potential health hazards in individuals .
In addition , it creates suspicion in individuals causing them to loss mutual trust for one another resulting in breaking of social relationship and family bonds .
Nevertheless , surveillance technology has limited efficiency in crime prevention hence it should not be use to track people since it fails to protect us .
Surveillance technology refers to the use of technology to monitor the behaviors or actions of people , usually in a surreptitious way .
Our most familiar types of such technology include cameras , computers , biometric or aerial surveillances .
As technology progresses , the rate of use of radio- frequency identification (RFID) , which is the use of a tag applied to livestock or people for the purpose of tracking or identification , has skyrocketed in many areas , ranging from government , hospitals to schools .
As an unavoidable consequence , it raises ethical issue , which states that such penetrating technology has invaded people's privacy because more and more personal habits and behaviors are monitored without permission .
However , I think that the use of such technology could be justified if the benefits it brings to the public outweigh the harms it brings to the individual .
It is demonstrated in hospitals , crimes and workplace .
Hence , the surveillance technology such as RFID should be used .
Firstly , the surveillance technology can be used in hospitals to monitor movements of its patients in case of emergency .
In conjunction with a video surveillance system to cover different regions of the hospital , it can track the patients' movements any time at any corners of the hospital .
When the subject enters a restricted area or has an emergency , the hospital can immediately know the whereabouts of the subject .
For example , in 2003 , a scenario of applying an RFID based tracking system during the SARS outbreak was demonstrated in two Singapore hospitals .
During the trial , the movement of people in the hospitals can be recorded (Adi T , September 2006) .
Thus , in this case , it is undisputable that the surveillance technology should be used to track people .
The most controversial issue about the use of surveillance technology would be ethical issue regarding people's privacy , which is strongly demonstrated in workplace privacy .
RFIDs in the workplace are attached to employees' identification cards or clothes so that the employer can track their movements any time .
For instance , RFID tags are placed in 80000 employee uniforms at the Star City Casino in Sydney Australia (Gruber , J .) .
Some people say that the install of such technology reduces the employees to robots , deprived their individuality to only-working-machines so as to achieve maximum productivity .
The employers monitor every movement of the employees during the break or even after hours .
This has intruded employees' privacy and thus should not be used .
However , I beg to argue that such RFID tags are only used within the workplace during the working time and when employees work in their positions , the company's privacy outweighs the individual privacy .
With RFID tags , the employers can combine the data together and better study the workplace pattern so as to improve efficiency .
Tagging employees can also reduce human errors and measure time .
The employees should sacrifice such individual privacy during the office time and cooperate with employers to make greater achievements for the workplace .
As a result , I think that the surveillance technology should be used .
In conclusion , I think the surveillance technology should be used as its benefits outweigh its harms .
It is useful in tracking patients in hospitals , criminals after they committed crimes and employees in workplace .
The individual privacy should be put aside when the benefit of public plays a more important role .
Surveillance technology such as RFID(radio-frequency identification) , GPS(Global Positioning System) and security cameras are used to monitor the action of public .
After the September 11 attack , the use of such technology has become more prevalent so as to increase security level (Vedo Soft 2006) .
It is also used to monitor those who require special attention such as Alzheimer's patients to ensure that they receive appropriate and quick medication during emergency .
Thus , on a whole , its advantages clearly outweigh its disadvantages such as individual's privacy .
Hence , it should be used appropriately to track people .
Firstly , using surveillance technology for crime prevention is far more important than individual privacy .
The presence of security cameras in public places helps to reduce crime rates as criminal fear that their actions will be recorded .
This will make the public feel safer .
According to park officials of Balboa park in San Diego , California , nine months after the installation of surveillance system , the crime rates has been reduced in all aspects and more people visits the park as they feel more secured (Nieto 1997) .
In Singapore , the Safety and Security Watch Group (SSWG) Scheme was introduced in 2006 so that the business community will be more prepared to fight crime and terrorism threats effectively(Singapore Police Force 2006) .
One of the common methods to ensure this is by surveillance technology and this has significantly helped Singapore to be one of the country with the lowest crime rates .
Opponents of surveillance technology may argue that it overwrites individual's privacy .
However , it is nearly impossible to always protect an individual's privacy as it may overlap with another individual's human right .
In this case , if surveillance technology is not implemented so as to protect individual's privacy , millions of innocent lives may be in danger  .
Furthermore , the surveillance technology is only used for security .
Thus , there is no need to fear when there is no crime done .
In addition , there are laws and regulation that is implemented to prevent the abuse of such technology .
Secondly , surveillance technology has been proven to be effective for social control as it helps to monitor those who needs special attention such as Alzheimer's patients .
Mary Barnes , the president of Alzheimer's Community Care , believes that RFID chip implanted in Alzheimer's patients allow medical facilities and information to be quickly and easily accessible for them (Richford 2007) .
Together with GPS , it is also able to track their location and detect if they are in danger .
This can also be used for other patients that requires special attention like heart and lung disease especially when it involves children and older generation .
This is useful as the caretaker may not be able to attend these patients 24 hours a day .
Thus , RFID help to ease their work but increase the efficiency simultaneously .
One may argue that the RFID chips might have side-effects on the patient's health .
It has been said that the RFID might lead to cancer .
However , there is no strong scientific evidence to show that it is harmful to the patient's health .
According to TIME magazine article written by Morrissey , a study conducted in 2006 showed that 4% of the 1 ,260 mice implanted with RFID developed tumors .
However , none of them are malignant .
In addition , Dr McGill said "Even if you put in a bland piece of plastic , it will produce tumors in rats and mice ,"(Morrissey 2007) .
Furthermore , the RFID tag has been approved by the U .S . Food and Drug Association(Richford 2007) .
In conclusion , the benefits that surveillance technology has brought to the society is far more advantageous than its unclear disadvantages .
"Should the use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned ?"
Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology has advanced from industrial and animal tagging applications to being able to track people's movements (Friedlos , 2009; Kanellos , 2004; Masters & Michael , 2006) .
This technology has brought about privacy and security issues (Kanellos , 2004; Masters & Michael , 2006) .
However , the benefits of RFID outweigh these issues .
Hence , the use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should not be banned .
Firstly , RFID enhances personnel management .
Efficient employee monitoring can be accomplished by tagging employees with RFID tags and installing readers within building premises .
Some companies made it compulsory for their staff to wear RFID tags to facilitate personnel identification and access control (Masters & Michael , 2006) .
RFID critics argue that the start-up cost for a fully operational RFID system is high .
Companies have to purchase tags (US $0 .20 - $50 each) , readers (UHF reader: US $500 - $3 ,000) , middleware (may be US $183 ,000) , upgrade system networks and pay installation fees (RFID Journal , 2005) .
However , companies will reap benefits in the long run .
Also , costs will come down as technology improves (RFID Journal , 2005) .
Thus , RFID can be used to improve management .
Secondly , RFID helps to reduce and solve crimes .
RFID can be used to monitor people who may pose a threat to society .
Knowing that they are being spied on , they will have less tendency to commit crimes .
Prison violence was reduced by up to 60% in some United States prisons that had RFID installed (Kanellos , 2004) .
Furthermore , data retrieved from RFID readers can serve as evidence against suspects to solve crimes (Kanellos , 2004) .
Opponents of RFID technology argue that implanted RFID tags cause cancer .
Implanted RFID tags were observed to cause tumours in laboratory animals (Albrecht , 2007) .
This concern is not necessary , because external tags can be used .
Overall , RFID is effective and beneficial in reducing and solving crimes .
Thirdly , RFID allows optimal patient care and safety in hospitals .
Tracking of medical professionals allows them to receive notification immediately when a patient needs help .
Tracking of patients ensures patient's safety by noticing if the patient is at the right place at the right time .
For example , in the United States , South Tyneside District Hospital tagged newborns with RFID tags , and hid RFID readers at exit points (Masters & Michael , 2006) .
Unauthorized removal of baby would trigger the alarm thus enhancing baby safety (Masters & Michael , 2006) .
Currently , Tan Tock Seng Hospital is using ThermoSensors , a new RFID tag which is capable of patient location tracking and body temperature monitoring (Friedlos , 2009) .
This has enhanced patient care as nurses have more time for other patients and are notified immediately when patient has a fever (Friedlos , 2009) .
Unfortunately , there are several security and privacy concerns .
But , these concerns can be addressed by giving individuals the choice of using RFID technology and freedom to remove tags when desired (Masters & Michael , 2006) .
Hence , RFID should be used to enhance patient care and safety .
In conclusion , it is evident that RFID benefits the defense and healthcare sector .
It helps to enhance management , reduce crimes and enable optimal patient care .
Thus , the use of RFID technology to track people should not be stopped .
The use of surveillance technology to track people should not be banned
During the recent years there has been an increasing uptake of the surveillance technology .
This kind of technology usually refers to the monitoring of behavior , activities , or other changing information of people and often in a surreptitious manner .
(Wikipedia , 2009) .
And the current technology has made it possible for the surveillance system into a wide-spread use in our daily life , such as electronic payment , supply chain management , and livestock .
(Postnote , 2004) .
But there are also some moral and ethical issues surrounding this technology , like whether this kind of technology such as RFID (radio frequency ID) should be used to track people .
Some argues that the tracking should be banned for it may causes serious outcomes related to the violation of privacy .
But I do not think it is reasonable to forgo this advanced technology for it really plays a great role in the areas related to healthcare and government , and the potential negative impacts brought by can be reduced or avoided if the regulations around it tend to be sounder and sounder .
I will further elaborate on my stand based on the above two aspects .
Second , the problems as regards to the privacy brought by the technology could be reduced or even avoided when the regulations around it tends to be more and more perfect .
In fact , many great inventions and breakthroughs in the humans history have got positive and negative aspects , such as the automobiles which have brought great convenience to people while causing large damages to the environment by emitting pollution gases .
And we just cannot stop using the automobiles .
The only thing we can do is to improve their efficiency and seek new and green power supplies for them to make them as environmental-friendly as possible .
As with the surveillance technology , we have to adopt it while making a great effort to establish a complete and reasonable set of principles surrounding it to make it more acceptable .
We just cannot stop having food even though we are afraid of choking .
In conclusion , surveillance technology has brought great benefits to our life and is accounting more and more in the hospital and government related areas .
And we should try our best to eliminate its negative effects on the privacy field instead of banning its use to tracking people .
http://en .wikipedia .org/wiki/Surveillance Electronic surveillance in hospitals:A review  ,by Sue Kennedy@2006
The last two decades witnessed drastic development in material science and digital processing technology , which made Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) , an advanced surveillance technology applied in the business and tracking world .
This controversial issue aroused wide concern from society , for RFID made tracking people easier .
While some hold that it intrudes people's privacy intensely , it in fact protects people in certain fields and makes life easier .
Thus , due to the advantages of RFID technology , it should not be banned .
Firstly , RFID can help to protect special groups of people .
For instance , this human use of it can be implanted in the elderly people who are suffering degenerative diseases .
(Surveillance Studies Network , 2006) Since it is so dangerous for elderly people with sick brain condition to get lost , carrying RFID chips enable their families to locate them .
Thus , it not only eliminates danger for those elderly people , but also reduces the worrying time and effort for their families .
Moreover , for some construction project with high fatality rates , obviously we need more accurate and reliable technology to protect workers during the programs .
RFID enables us to provide accurate position of every worker who carries its tag .
Hence , it allows workers to be rescued quickly and reliably in case of an emergency .
This high-tech system was used in the second Gotthard tunnel grogram and other companied like Kronos Titan , Leverkusen (Germany)in the chemical sector for production of hazardous materials .
(Hansen & Gilbert , 2008)
Secondly , RFID is an efficient and reliable surveillance tool to watch people who carry underlying threat .
For the prisoners in custody , it is necessary to watch and track them in case of adding crime .
(Surveillance Studies Network , 2006) Meanwhile , using RFID to keep watching those employees working for high-security areas confers benefits that are clear and compelling .
Hence , it is so necessary and sufficient for us to apply RFID technology to such areas .
In conclusion , RFID as a surveillance technology should not be banned as it protects special groups of people and help to watch people who have potential threat to our society .
Surveillance technology is necessary in today's society (Evans , 2008) , although some people may feel that it is an invasion of privacy (Kanellos , 2004) .
Using surveillance technology to track people has benefitted people in three areas , socially , in the medical field and in the military sector .
It should therefore not be banned .
Socially , surveillance technology is used to track people .
Radio frequency identification (RFID) chips and tags are used to track people .
It is a boon for parents looking for their children amidst a large crowd , like in an amusement park (Fortune magazine , 2004) .
Employers can also track the location of their employees to ensure that they are safe , especially at hazardous worksites (Intelleflex Corporation , 2009) using RFID badges .
Another way would be to implant RFID chips under their skin .
Citywatcher .com , a surveillance company , is one of those companies to have RFID chips implanted in their employees' arms (Gruber , n .d .) for safety measures .
However , RFID chips implanted under the skin are difficult to remove as they could migrate under the skin (American Medical Association , 2008) and not all employees want to be implanted with these chips .
This however is not a problem as many states have banned employers from forcing employees to receive a RFID implant (Jones , 2007) .
Therefore , surveillance technology should not be banned since there are counter-measures in place and less invasive methods like the RFID tags available .

Another sector using surveillance technology to track people would be the medical field .
Maternity wards in hospitals ensure that babies are not swapped accidentally with the help of RFID tags (Fortune magazine , 2004) .
Patients are also given RFID tags to wear so that should they begin to collapse , aid can be given to them immediately (Kanellos , 2004) .
RFID tags are also used to monitor patients with Alzheimer's disease according to Kanellos (2004) to prevent them from getting lost .
The RFID tags are broken once patients are discharged so the bed can be prepared for new patients so waiting time would be reduced .
Consequently , if nurses did not break the tag , disorder might result since the bed is no longer occupied but the housekeeping team is not informed .
Surgeries can also proceed smoothly and timely as both staff and patients can be tracked since they are wearing the tags .
This clearly shows that surveillance technology brings about many benefits so it should not be banned .
Surveillance technology is essential in the military sector to track enemies and to search and rescue soldiers .
Technology like the Global positioning system (GPS) is used to track enemies from the air (Gately , 2009) , while the artesian radar and SPY-1 radar is used to monitor the sea (Evans , 2008) .
All these technologies are to deter and detect enemies so countries are not caught unawares should enemies invade .
However , these systems are not without flaws as it was reported that Korean Air Lines Flight 007 strayed and was shot down in a Soviet no-fly zone (Gately , 2009) .
To address this issue , civilians are now able to use the GPS to ensure that they do no stray into these zones although usage is limited (Gately , 2009) .
Downed pilots are also located and rescued efficiently .
U .S . Air Force pilot , Captain Scott O'Grady was rescued within hours with the help of the GPS (LANDAIRSEA , 2009) .
Hence , these technologies should not be banned as it efficiently locates enemies , save lives and at the same time ensures that civilians are not harmed by the new regulations .
In conclusion , there are some issues about using surveillance technologies to track people in the social , medical and military aspects .
Nevertheless , using surveillance technology to track people has brought about many benefits and there are regulations to ensure that these technologies would not be abused .
Hence it should not be banned .

Surveillance technology refers to the use of technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) to observe the activities of certain people or things , in particular to gather information .
Apart from RFID , there are many types of surveillance technology such as computer , camera , mobile , aerial and biometric surveillance .
Although the use of surveillance technology , especially to track people , has raised many ethical issues because it intrudes people's privacy , I believe that it should not be banned .
However , one has to take note of the limit as in the extent of its implementation and purposes .
If the benefits it can bring supersede the violation of the individual right , then logically it should be implemented .
Firstly , surveillance technology can be used for security and deterrent to prevent crimes .
The concept of human tagging has been widely accepted , but one has to take note on its purpose .
Applied Digital Solution produced sub-dermal RFID tags in late 90s and it has found many applications nowadays .
For those regions where kidnapping are more prevalent such as Mexico , children tagging can actually help their parent identify them after many years or it can serve as a mean to deter kidnapping because parent can locate their children using gadgets (Wired , February 2000) .
However , some may say that it brings back the nightmare of the images of George Orwell's novel with human tagging as RFID takes away the privacy of the person being monitored , but RFID is not being used on the entire population .
It is just used in specific area or person who actually benefits from its application such as in the case of child kidnapping .
The parents have the authoritative rights for the well-being of their children .
Thus , surveillance technology should not be banned but one has to take note of the purpose of its application .
Secondly , the application of surveillance technology has found its use in sports .
With the RFID tag being clipped on runners' shoes , organisers can record the running time of every runner easily and accurately .
It brings great ease to the organisers of the marathon races in which there are so many contestants .
The reason why it is so difficult to track and record accurately in the past is that in such a big event , it may take about one hour for certain runners to even reach the starting point and start the race .
For this case , there is no ethical issue involved so surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should not be banned .
Fourthly , we have seen the application of surveillance technology in health care to tag its patients .
The purpose is to make sure the medical records actually tally with the patients being described .
It can provide information such as patients' allergies and it is extremely crucial to ensure correct association .
Critics may argue that we can also use wrist bands in which there are barcodes on the patients .
However , there is a tendency that one makes mistakes in typing on a keyboard .
Thus , those printed labels are susceptible to errors so it is not that reliable .
Since we have a better technology to ensure the accuracy , I see no reason to ban such surveillance technology .
Moreover , patients are supposed to be monitored so privacy issues are no concern here .
In conclusion , surveillance technology should not be banned , but one has to take not of the purposes of its applications .
Its applications in child kidnapping , marathon races , security of a country and health care have brought great benefits to human beings .
The benefits actually supersede the violation of people's privacy or in some case it does not violate at all .
We have seen that the identification technology has progressed in leaps and bounds over the last few decades .
One good example of such applications is the usage of RFID , a cutting-edge technology that uses radio waves for the purpose of tracking and monitoring .
There are however , variety of issue raised associated with the appropriateness to deploy RFID technology to track individuals .
This is primarily due to the fear of privacy invasion , dehumanization , and the social impact of mass surveillance after putting such technology in place .
Nonetheless , despite RFID is still progressing in its infancy stage , it is seen to possess uncapped potential and can be put into valuable uses , especially in connection with hospital- patient identification , anti-theft tracking as well as in government agencies for identification purpose .
Firstly , RFID system can be utilized widely in hospital in-patient identification .The system can be used to monitor the whereabouts of patients and also medical personnel staffs in the hospital .
One good advantage about the device is that it does not require line-of-sight monitoring .
RFID allows health conditions of patients such as blood pressure , heart rate and blood sugar level to be kept in check from time to time with ease .
These records contain both medical chart information and digital photos to minimize the frequency of surgical errors and improve the efficiency of operating rooms during the clinical process .
(Pye ,2008) In addition , implementation of RFID tag is highly useful in tracking the location of Alzheimer's patient .
It ensures a higher level of security and also allows nurses to administer more patients at a time .
Opponents of RFID surveillance may voice concerns over the health hazards posed as a result of over exposure to radioactivity which may lead to cancer .
However , research done has revealed a small and insignificant correlation of cancer risk to RFID .
Secondly , the sophisticated tracking technology can be put into good use in combating theft and retrieving lost items in department stores .
Unlike barcodes , RFID do not need to be placed precisely relative to the scanner .
The adoption of RFID for "logistics units and higher-value , lower volume items" is believed to simultaneously improve the supply chain efficiency as well as prevent property crime .
(Raza , 2008) .
RFID provides tight security that allows merchandise to be tracked effectively .
Whilst some opined that the use of RFID is not favoured due to its expensive nature , its effectiveness is much higher than that of the conventional tracking system .
Thus , it is relatively more cost-saving in a long run .
Thirdly , another application of RFID technology that is currently in use in government agencies is that the setting up of centralized nationwide database that would maintain a complete medical history and other relevant information of a person .
Swedberg (2004) cited that in countries like New Zealand , Pakistan , as well as Malaysia have embedded RFID chips in their citizen's identification card .
Public transportation systems worldwide use RFID enabled system to track and bill use of the services .
RFID chips are also being used in identification cards in corporations and school to control unauthorized access .
One may argue that these can lead to potential infringement of confidentiality should one's personal information leak out .
However , the worries are unnecessary since the increasingly secure and private operations that are being set up could reduce the possibility of unintended access to information .
With all that have been said , the advantages of the usage of RFID clearly outweigh the drawbacks of the technology .
There is a need for social control of higher security and safety .
Nevertheless , RFID remains the least intrusive technology that allows us to achieve the objective .
It is undeniable that there are far-fetched controversial issues surrounding the use of RFID which requires deep consideration by all of us .
One needs to understand the benefits being brought about by RFID in different sectors .
Hence , this labor-saving technology should be utilized optimally as it is capable of bringing numerous benefits and conveniences to the society .
The rapid development of technology has made it possible for a person to track other people by using surveillance technology .
Surveillance technology is a new technology to monitor and find out other people's activities and behavior .
There are many kinds of surveillance technology and RFID is one of them .
RFID is Radio Frequency Identification that uses electromagnetic spectrum to transmit signal so that we can locate the exact position of someone .
However , as a new technology arises , there may be some controversies that follow and RFID is no exception .
On one side , some people think that surveillance technology should not be used to track other people because it intrudes other people's privacy .
On the other hand , some argue that this technology should be used , especially for security reason .
However , because of many detrimental effects that occur , the usage of surveillance technology to track other people should be banned .
On the other hand , some people may think that the usage of RFID to track other people will turn out to be beneficial especially if it is operated for security purpose such as surveillance security camera .
By using this technology , all of the activities that are happening can be viewed through camera so it is important to organize the security of the place (Burnell ,2007) .
The other use of RFID that some people think could bring advantage is RFID microchip implanted inside human body , especially in those who suffer chronic illness such as Alzheimer or Dementia .
This technology will help their family to identify their positions whenever they get lost .
However , in fact , the usage of RFID could increase crime rates .
The hacker can track other people's data far easier , causing numerous unmanaged conditions .
They can take advantage of the information they get by threatening or manipulating others .
Moreover , by being able to track people wherever they go , the tracker can do unpleasant actions to those people without much difficulty .
First and foremost , usage of surveillance technology in hospital can improve the success rate of cure especially for emergency cases .
(Kennedy , 2006) Timing always plays a key role in surgery or even in other processes of curing or healing which the public might not aware of it .
In many cases , the faster the surgeries can be carry out the higher the success rate of the surgeries are .
There are cases which the main reason for surgical failure is that the surgeries did not carry out in time .
Does not it sound pity to you ?
In many cases lives of the patients can be saved if the surgeries did carry out on time .
Surveillance technology provide a good solution for this problem by helping the hospital to shorten the time to locate their staffs , the equipment , and most important the patients .
As tracking of the staffs and the patients is such important in the medical field , surveillance technology should be allowed to use to track people .
Besides that , surveillance technology also can contribute in crime prevention and detection .
({http://www .spygearco .com/blog/index .php/how-to-prevent-crime-using-surveillance/}[HYPERLINK: http://www .spygearco .com/blog/index .php/how-to-prevent-crime-using-surveillance/]) Information provided by surveillance is considered as a strong source of evidence in detection of crime .
For example , police can confirm or disprove an alibi or even can find out the whole criminal process as it can be recorded if there is a surveillance device .
In some western countries like USA , England and others surveillance technology has been widely used to monitor public action , when a crime happen , cob can track down the crime very efficient .
As a result , we can bring down the criminal rate by using surveillance technology .
Last but not least , people find that their privacy is being infringed by the technology so some of them react aggressively and try to ban the technology .
However , coin has two faces we should not emphasis too much at the disadvantages of the technology but should try the best to overcome the problem .
Banning the technology in fact is the worst way to solve the problem .
I believe , with the effort put in by the government , lawmaker , the public and others we will be able to use the technology in a perfect way in near future .
In other words we should show our demand for surveillance technology which work in a better way but not trying to ban the technology .
In conclusion , since surveillance technology has bring a lot of advantages to us and has potential to become less harm to the public in the future we should support the technology as it is one of the way to improve our living standard by lowering criminal rate and enhance medical standard .
"The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned ."
Cameras on streets , GPS (Global Positioning System) on vehicles , RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags on products , animals and people , as well as mobile phones on hands are typical in today's world .
We have developed into a surveillance society due to great advancement in technology .
Such technology provides higher security as it facilitates the monitoring and tracking of people and their actions .
However , this has also caused a controversy where some argued that surveillance technology has invaded their privacy to a very large extent .
In my opinion , the use of surveillance technology such as RFID should not be banned as we must protect ourselves from threats such as terrorism which may potentially have a massive impact on our vulnerable lives .
Firstly , surveillance technology in RFID tagging can be used to track terrorists and criminals .
This increases convenience and efficiency as more criminals can be easily tracked using such tags and their actions can be monitored closely which can help in combating crimes .
On the other hand , RFID tagging can also be used on patients for nurses or doctors to keep an eye on them in case they have inappropriate actions such as moving towards unsafe areas or they suffer from a sudden organ failure .
Therefore , it is crucial for the existence of such technology so that we can live in a safer environment .
However , critics argued that surveillance technology has greatly intruded their personal space where they have this psychological feeling of 'being watched' by others on every single day .
To think of it , would you rather want a safe environment which your privacy may be compromised , or to choose privacy over safety ?
Everyone has different perception on privacy .
Therefore its bias to say that surveillance technology threatens one's privacy to a huge extent .
Furthermore , mobile phones , WI-FI (wireless fidelity) as well as satellites also have the ability to track people's actions .
They are still widely in use nowadays .
Thus surveillance technology has become a necessity rather than a burden as we cannot do without it .
In conclusion , surveillance technology has undoubtedly brought us great convenience despite the fact that one's privacy is marginally sacrificed .
Cameras have aided in many areas such as shops , traffic junctions and even within the household where parents can monitor their children at home while at work , ensuring that their children are safe and sound .
Hence , surveillance technology should not be banned as it is crucial in the modern society where there are threats around us and the only way to prevent such threats is through the use of such brilliant technology .
Surveillance is the process of monitoring the behaviours and activities , usually of people without their permission .
Lots of surveillance tools are invented , such as CCTV (close circuit television) cameras , RFID (radio-frequency identification) , GPS (global positioning system) etc .
Extensive and growing use of electronic surveillance technology has resulted in considerable debate especially the ethical questions concerning privacy .
Although it appears to be breaching the privacy of communities , surveillance technology has in fact enabled to track the public's health , ensured the public safety and monitored the employees in companies .
Therefore , I fully agree that the use of surveillance technology to track people should not be banned .
First of all , surveillance technology should not be banned as it has enabled the tracking of health of public .
By means of somatic surveillance , information like heart rate and hormone levels can be translated into data for medical purposes .
The implantation of RFID into the body facilitates the proper identification of hospital patients .
Besides that , it can supply detailed body information to hospitals and then public can alter their behaviours like exercise and diet after the interpretation from doctors .
With the implants , RFID chips may convey the messages regarding health conditions of patients , such as those with epilepsy , heart disease , or mental impairment , especially for those who are unable to communicate effectively with hospital staff about their medical histories or current complaints when they are in need of immediate treatment .
In addition , it also decreases the slight discrepancy of diagnosis by doctor due to the influence of their experiences .
The embedded chip can provide accurate and objective information of patients .
Thus , surveillance technology to track the health of communities aids in reducing the mortality rate due to health problems and also decreasing the misinterpretation of verbal communication by the doctors .
Secondly , surveillance technology can be used by employers to monitor their employees during working hours .
This is very crucial as to ensure that the productivity and the efficiency of workers are kept to a maximum .
For instance , employees might seem to be surfing the web for business purposes at all time , but what they are actually doing is personal business such as online banking , shopping and chatting .
Skiving and loafing of employees cause companies to lose many man hours and resources .
If the behaviour of employees at work is monitored , they will work more efficiently and contribute to the company .
It has been argued that one's privacy might be invaded due to surveillance technology (Heathfield , n .d . , p .2) .
However , monitoring can take place under suitable circumstances and to an appropriate extent as it is only installed at the working places .
It has also been said that surveillance of employees can affect the relationship between employer and employees (Heathfield , n .d . , p .2) .
However , this only applies to those minority spending most of the time online doing personal things and do not meet the company's goals .
Using of surveillance technology has no impact for those focusing on work and doing the right thing (Heathfield , n .d . , p .2) .
Furthermore , security issue is very essential for factories manufacturing coins and jewelleries .
Surveillance cameras can trace the movement of the workers .
Suspicious behaviour by the employees can be reviewed by their employers through the electronic records .
This can alleviate the theft rate in the factories .
As a result , surveillance technology can facilitate the employers to monitor their workers with an extent of not breaching their privacy .
Moreover , surveillance technology is vital in ensuring the safety of public .
Through video and satellite surveillance , polices can track the movement of dangerous criminals and terrorists .
Besides that , tracking of missing or kidnapped children (Stump , 2008 , para .1) is made possible too .
With the help of CCTV cameras , the whole criminal processes can be recorded .
By that time , polices are able to trace the culprits' physical appearance and vehicle's number .
Then , the time taken to solve the criminal cases is tremendously reduced , compared with the crime not being recorded .
The video recorded becomes a concrete proof to subject the culprits for sanction .
Eventually , public security is guaranteed .
On the other hand , for those having disease like Alzheimer's disease , surveillance technology facilitate in finding them out if they get lost in somewhere else .
Similarly , those running away from home , possibly caused by family factors or mental problems , can be tracked via CCTV cameras in the shortest period .
This prevents them from doing things that are unfavourable or irrational .
Hence , public safety can be ensured by the utilization of surveillance technology .
In conclusion , surveillance technology should not be banned as it ensures the health and safety of public , besides being used to monitor the performance of employees .
If we persist with banning of surveillance technology , public will be exposed to a dangerous environment in which crime will happen frequently .
After that , crime will lead to adverse consequences to the individual , then to the country and finally to the world .
Without the surveillance , the decreased productivity of workers may bring the unemployment issue to the surface again .
Although until now there are still many debates about the ethical issues of surveillance technology , it after all still benefits the communities in many perspectives , so banning of surveillance technology should not be initiated .
"The use of surveillance technology such as Radiofrequency Identification (RFID) to track people should be banned ."
My stand is to control and not a total ban .
The increasing use of technology has done much for mankind .
It has changed many aspects of our lives and has unknowingly penetrated ubiquitously into our society making many of us dependent on it .
Even though technological advances proves to be a marvel as we move faster into the future , it does not only bring about benefits but also negative repercussions if not dealt with properly .
Surveillance has been around for hundreds of years but technology has 'springboard' it to a much higher level .
Due to this drastic change and lack of legislation , many have used new gadgets to their benefits even if it is against human rights .
Of course , surveillance technology does have its benefits to the society in terms of safety and security but does it outweigh the undesirable problems that it brings ?
Tracking of personnel has always been in the spotlight because it steps too much into the boundaries of human rights .
The use of miniature tracking devices to trail the whereabouts of one's 'target' has kept human rights activist in action .
One such example dates back to an article "Challenge over tracking devices" , posted on the 21st of November 2000 by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) , where a security company is taken to court under Britain's new human rights law to remove all tracking devices in their vans .
Of course , the company has its reasons to do so such as tracking their vehicles and also providing better service to their customers .
Yet many have argued that it is against human rights and thus promote the banning of tracking devices .
Undeniably surveillance technologies do overlap with human rights law , but more often than not , the use of these technologies bring about more benefits than negative consequences .
It boils down to the purpose of these technologies and how one uses it .
In conclusion , there should not be a complete ban of the use of surveillance but adequate control by oneself or a governing body to restrict the abuse of this powerful tool .
Surveillance technology and security has become crucial to each country since the terrorist attack in the US on Sept 11 .
Surveillances technology is the use of devices to monitor any behaviour , activities or other changing information that is deemed to be important to any government or personnel's security .
But this has gone too far , with security came the lost of personal privacy .
Own freedom is compromised and with much hesitant , I do not agree that surveillance technology should be use to track people .
Personal privacy is our very own right .
We live our own way and nobody have the right to monitor or dictate our actions .
Why should they ?
Be it the government's security reasons or other excuses , they have no right to impose such a technology on others without our permission .
Public concern for personal and data privacy has also gained momentum in recent years , with government responding by forming an inter-ministerial committee to review the need for a data protection law (Sim , n .d .) .
Secondly , it erodes trust and creates a climate of fear in the person being monitor and the people around them .
Fear is a very strong tool and terrorists use it to create mayhem and destruction in our lives .
Fear causes psychological problems such as anxiety and the lost of a person's confident .
Anxiety is a very difficult mental disorder to cure and it takes a very long time for a person to overcome this but with constant disturbances from knowing that he or she is being monitor , it will become a significant problem in their daily lives .
"Collection of personal data (e .g . , lifestyle information for insurance purposes) also reveals intimate aspects of the self to others within the work environment" (Santon , 2003) .
"Symptoms like palpitations , breathlessness and tense feelings that are serious enough to disrupt their daily routine" (IMH , 2008) will appear in the person .
Lastly , the use of Surveillance technology can be abused by the government and or any agency that used it .
The government can use it to track any opposition to its policies .
Like in the case of South Africa during the apartheid period whereby opposing to the regime was monitor using the surveillance technology .
Thousand of opposition members were arrested and ill treated by the regime .
The situation became better when Nelson Mandela successfully became the president but at the price of he himself was the victim of their abuse .
Greed and corruption sink in when the people at the very top refuse to give up their power and used underhand means to keep themselves in power .
They will do anything and that does include using any surveillance device to monitor their nemesis .
With easy evidence at their disposal , they will use the law to suppress any opposition to their will .
In conclusion , harm inflicted and personal privacy will be intruded , goes to show that Surveillance technology should not be used to track people as it can be abused by the people who used it .
Surveillance technology systems are tools which can identify , monitor and track movements and data .
Previously , the common practice for surveillance has always been through physical means such as prison guards , but in modern times it has been improved and upgraded through image amplification devices such as binoculars , closed circuit cameras and high- resolution satellite cameras (Bogonikolos , 1999) .
Radio-frequency identification tags (RFID) are among the several types of surveillance technologies of today .
It is a type of automatic identification method that is used to track prescription drugs to pets and , in some cases , even humans .
Although these surveillance technologies may provide many potential benefits such as law enforcement , the issue raises a great deal of controversies as well .
Surveillance technology such as RFID should not be used to track people .
The main concern for this technology is with regards to privacy .
RFID can be deciphered from afar and they contain more information than barcodes (Free , 2007) .
Consumers are at the greatest disadvantage when it comes to RFID technology because hidden placement of tags by companies allows information to be retrieved from consumers .
These tags which are embedded in consumer products could theoretically keep tabs on a person worldwide provided there are readers in certain locations around the globe .
Personal information may be jeopardized by these tags , leaking information like medical history .
These devices threaten to deprive mankind of its mysteries , offering a world where people are only told what the government and large corporations approve of .
Even libraries are rolling out RFID as a means to track books , but the possibility of tracking people carrying the books has not been considered (Free , 2007) .
Another concern of RFID is the health risks that it imposes on humans .
Although the implanted chips can aid in storing valuable medical information that could prevent any misfortune or mistreatments to the patients , the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns of risks like rejection or adverse tissue reaction with any RFID implants (CASPIAN Special Report , 2004) .
Not everyone is able to get an implant without side effects because each person's immunity system differs from one another .
In addition , patients might suffer severe burns .
There's a possibility that the implanted transponder will migrate and travel in the body , causing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) incongruence and electromagnetic interference .
An MRI machine utilizes strong magnetic fields along with pulsed radio frequency fields that may induce electrical currents in conductive metal implants such as the RFID tags (CASPIAN Special Report , 2004) .
Presumably , MRI incompatibility with the tags means that patients possessing RFID implants are unable to undergo this potentially life-saving diagnostic procedure , unless they conduct a surgery and have the tag removed beforehand .
Also , RFID propose the risks of information leak during transmission of information .
The RFID implant uses radio waves to transmit medical and financial account information to reader devices .
One would be concerned that this information will be intercepted; duplicated and abused by others or that the device could be used to track an individual's movements and location .
Proof hackers can clone these RFID chips and hence cause the risk of identity theft to increase .
For example , the United States military were keen on the idea and were amongst the first subscribers of the technology .
Every pallet , carton and big-ticket item being shipped to the military was affixed with a RFID tag (Bogonikolos , 1999) .
With complete product information on a tag , enemies can conveniently extract information off a tag .
The information can then be used to identify the military's strengths and weaknesses and can be used to endanger the country , its soldiers and civilians should the information fall into the wrong hands .
In conclusion , surveillance technology such as RFID should not be used to track people .
Although cost for RFID systems in the future will decrease , privacy issues , health issues and security issues will still exist .
RFID still has a long way to go before it becomes a feasible technology to be implemented .
Privacy issues must be given main priority and with sufficient control and attention from all relevant parties , RFID will benefit society as a whole and will not jeopardize human rights .

We live in an age where information proliferates , both in terms of its formulation and its availability .
Modern surveillance technology has constructed a mean for us to gather information readily .
RFID first appeared in 1940 with the primary aim of identifying aircraft for military purposes .
However , as RFID becomes more prevalent in our society , it is now able to retrieve information from almost anywhere , anyone .
Tentatively , with surveillance , security is on whole tightened .
However , whilst maintaining the level of security , surveillance is often seen as an invasion to privacy .
Many would agree that the sophisticated surveillance technology has indeed been beneficial in the security arena especially after the September 11th incident and government has since then diverts their attention to tracking potential terrorists instead of tracking explosive devices or substances .
For instance , in its effort to locate any suspicious character , Britain has over 4 million CCTV cameras installed along almost every street , every corner just to keep track of every individual (BBC News , 2006) .
The implementation of such a system has successfully foiled some of the terrorist's plan .
Furthermore , individual would behave themselves upon knowing that they are constantly being "watched" , leading to a possible decrease in crime rates .
As far as the government is concerned , with the use of surveillance device , security is greatly enhanced and discipline is observed .
Thus , tracking individuals using surveillance technology would result in a safer environment to live in .
Jones , M . (2006) .
Britain is 'surveillance society' Retrieved October 5 , 2009 , from http://news .bbc .co .uk/2/hi/uk/6108496 .stm
On the other hand , some argued that such method has inevitably threatened the most basic human rights to freedom as every movements or speech , for more advanced devices , they made are meticulously monitored .
"Privacy is an inherent human right and a requirement for maintaining the human condition with dignity and respect ."
(Schneier B ,2006) Then , there are individuals who abuse the usage of surveillance technology by sending their partner a gift with RFID attached to it so that they will be able to track the location of their partner and know who they are hanging out with .
Obviously such acts are morally wrong and hence the use of surveillance technology to track people should be banned if individual misuse it .
(Lee and Tan , 2007) However , individual should also have their right to security , which in turn allows the intervention of government .
Nation security is altogether far more important then the mere privacy entitled to individual .
RFID is also use to track criminals within the prison , detainees or ex-convict .
The RFID would be able to trace their location and monitor their behavior .
If Mas Selamat bin Kastari was to have a RFID tag , he would not be able to escape and there would not have been so much fear instilled among Singaporean during that period of his disappearance .
By employing such operation , government would thus be able to prevent any possible mishap from happening .
All these boil down to the question "How much privacy are we willing to sacrifice for the sake of a more secure life ?"
(Anderson R , 2007) .
An opinion poll conducted among Americans and Europeans has shown that 75% of the respondents "want more , not less , surveillance" (BBC News , 2007) Furthermore , "If it prevents criminal behaviour or improves its detection I'm all for it ."
(Jones M , 2006) .
Perhaps , the increases in the number of terrorists attack has proven to us that government should also tap on the advantages of current technology to counter those sophisticated attacks carried out by the terrorists .
In conclusion , there should be a balance between maintaining security and protecting privacy .
On the minor scale , it is the individual themselves who are abusing such technology for their own gain .
However , when looking from a broader perspective , surveillance technology would have been the platform to stop any terrorist attacks or crimes from happening .
In addition , since most people recognize the main objective of surveillance technology , such technology should not be banned even if it includes spying individuals .

Surveillance technology is the utilization of electronic equipment such as RFID , GPS , and CCTV to monitor the behavior of individuals or groups .
This technology is widely used in public places for the reason of security maintenance , as well as for the purpose of identification and tracking of information .
For example , CCTV is installed in airports , banks , department stores , and even the streets to prevent crime in those areas , while RFID can be used as access key within an organization , means of managing mobile assets of a company , or tool for identifying and tracking of equipment , staffs , and patients in a hospital .
In fact , there are still a lot of applications to RFID in various fields and industries including security , public transport , healthcare , and e-payment that its popularity is increasing rapidly .
Nevertheless , there are some problems and controversies surrounding the use of such technology despite the convenience it brings to the society .
Most concerns revolve around the issue of privacy and confidentiality since the technology is capable of collecting personal data about a person without consent .
As such , the use of surveillance technology such as RFID should be carefully limited so that it is not misused to track people or gather sensitive data about a third party .
There are some ways RFID can cause privacy concerns .
RFID tag incorporated into an item can be read from several distances away .
The individual carrying the item may be unaware of the presence of the tag , thus rendering him vulnerable of privacy breaches (Bhaskar 2007) .
Such cases are most likely to happen to a customer purchasing products with RFID tags .
Moreover , if the products are paid by a credit card or in conjunction with the use of a loyalty card , the identity of the customer can be linked to the unique serial number of the tag (Bhaskar 2007) .
This data can eventually be used to find out private information about the customer , which is a serious breach of privacy to the customer concerned .
Therefore , regulations should be made to protect the privacy of individuals , such as the need to indicate the existence of the tags on customer products and the restriction on information gathering .
There are some problematic complications that may arise due to the use of RFID to track people .
For instance , personally identifiable information (PII) such as license plate number of an individual carrying an RFID enabled card or travel document can be read by a third party without his consent since unauthorized RFID reader can read the RFID number from the card or document (US Department of Homeland Security 2008) .
However , some may argue that the benefits of surveillance technology actually compensate the concerns about privacy .
RFID tag embedded into items or products can help owners to track down their valuable belongings should their items be stolen or missing .
RFID also helps to identify disaster victims , and provide effective treatment for patients in emergency situation in a hospital .
While these may be true , without the restriction of the use of the technology , abusive use of the information may cost greatly .
In other words , RFID may be used to track people , but only limited to a certain degree .
For example , it is acceptable to track patients if the patients concerned really need it .
In conclusion , the use of surveillance technology to track people should be restricted only to some special cases , as in the case of a dependent patient in a hospital who needs constant surveillance .
It is a breach of privacy to use this technology for supervising and collecting personal and private information about an individual or group .
Moreover , any third party with appropriate equipment is able to read information from the individual concerned , which may eventually lead to the abusive use of the information .
Therefore , the restriction on the usage of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be wholly supported .
Surveillance technology can be used for instance to monitor the data exchange on network or to observe the activity of someone using a surveillance camera .
One of the examples of surveillance technology is Radio Frequency Identification or RFID .
RFID is a system that keeps track of a tagged object by utilizing radio waves(What is RFID ?) .
However people are mainly concerned with their privacy being violated since they are being tracked down .
It can also gives out the important information on the individual without any permission from the person .
Hence , the idea of spying people by using technology such as RFID has to be banned .
There are two main reasons why RFID should be prohibited .
The first reason is concerned with the idea of individual's privacy (CASPIAN , 2003) .
When someone buys a product that is tagged with RFID , the radio wave can still be detected as long as the chip is still active and in range of detection .
This means revealing the position and behavioral information of the person .
Groups of consumer in UK , France , Germany and Netherland were polled by a consultancy group named Capgemini and 95% of the consumers were worried that the information gathered from RFID could be used freely without their consent by third parties (BBC , 2005) .
This survey indicates that privacy's breach is indeed an important concern for people .

Secondly , the information gathered through RFID can be used in a way that can endanger the life of the individual itself (CASPIAN , 2003) .
In fact , every RFID tag is assigned a unique serial number .
For instance , terrorists with appropriate equipments can target a high-ranking official by setting the bomb to explode as soon as the target is in the detection range .
Robbers can identify rich person just by reading the RFID tag on the things the person buys .
All of these can be done in a radius of few meters and these make it even harder for the person to realize that they are being spied .
These examples illustrate the problem of how the RFID can be utilized to harm people instead of saving them .
Others argue that RFID can be used to stop terrorists by monitoring the nation's food supply , hence keeping the food from the terrorists (Baard , 2003) .
However in this age of digital information , people can easily find an Internet connection and type a few keywords like "remove RFID tag" .
The fact that by using technology not more sophisticated than what is in a cell phone , the RFID tag can be disabled completely (Invoke Media , 2006) .
This shows that the RFID tag is not effective in tracking people particularly the terrorists .
To wrap up the discussion on the controversy of using RFID to track people , the examples above show how ineffective is the RFID system on spying people like the terrorists since the RFID tag can be removed easily .
On the other hand , some group of people can even misuse this piece of technology to harm others for the sake of their benefit .
Moreover , survey by a consultancy group Capgemini shows that the majority of the respondents were very concerned over their privacy's breach particularly on the use of RFID system to track them .
Thus , the use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned .

RFID also known as radio frequency identification is a piece of technology , which makes use of electromagnetic or electrostatic waves in the radio frequency so as to identify or pass the information through the radio wave .
However , should we ban the use of surveillance technology such as RFID ?
Like many other pieces of surveillance technology , RFID also infringes on privacy issue .
In addition , it also possesses some potential hazards to one if one is implanted with the chip .
Yet , there are far more important benefits if we incorporate the use of RFID , hence we must not ban RFID due to the few negative effects that RFID will have on the future .
It is common to hear that most technologies are like a double-edged sword so is the piece of technology , RFID .
Scientists have shown that if the RFID is implanted in the human body , it will interfere with the hospital equipment [Anonymous , 2008] , hence handicapping the doctors in their treatment for the patients .
Thus it is not encouraged to implant a RFID chip .
However , It will be plain ignorant to ban RFID base on this limitation as there are rooms for improvement since it is still at its developing stage .
For the past years , the controversy of surveillance technology infringing one's right to privacy still exists and will continue to happen .
However , there can be some laws pass down to ensure that technologies like RFID are not abuse and use in the proper direction .
For example , like the surveillance camera , peeping toms and other criminals commonly use them for crimes , yet why does the government still allow such technology to be used .
The reasons are that the priority of ensuring the privacy of corporations and the safety of the people are of more importance .
Similarly , RFID , which is more feasible and useful than surveillance camera since it can cover a longer range of area than surveillance camera , should not be banned .
Surveillance technology refers to gadgets that are able to observe and monitor individuals' behavior and activity from a distance using electronic equipment .
CCTV's and RIFD (radio-frequency identification) are some examples of surveillance technology .
With the invention of such technology , controversy over the use of this technology has been increasing .
While some feel that the existence of this technology helps to tackle problems related to tracking people , others are against this technology simply because it is an intrusion into a person's privacy (Greene ,T 2004) .
I believe that this technology should not be used to track people down .
Another point to be raised is that surveillance technology may not be effective in preventing nor reducing crime rates as many people would assume that they do .
With the usage of the surveillance technology it gives people a false sense of security because they feel that with technology looking after them they are sure to be safe .
However this may not be the case because surveillance may only help to catch the criminal after the crime has been committed .
Most of the times information from such surveillance technology is redundant because the information recorded during the crime does not provide enough evidence to arrest the criminal .
Furthermore criminals are being wiser each day; they may outsmart the technology by hacking in to the system to prevent them from being caught .
Therefore it is certainly not a wise choice to use surveillance camera as a replacement of security guards .
Another concern of using surveillance is the health issue .
The usages of certain surveillance gadgets such as RFID being implanted in to the body of individuals are tested to be harmful to the human body .
Humans that are being implanted by these chips have higher incidences of getting cancer (Layden , J 2007) .
Thought the possibility of getting cancer is not 100% but why should humans exposed themselves to a higher risk of this deadly disease ?
In conclusion , I strongly disagree in the usage of surveillance technology because it is a invasion to privacy , it does not really reduce crime rates and it raises a problem related to health issues .
The money used to futher develop this technology and to implement this technology is better spend on more useful area's such as the education and medical .

Rapid development of technology enables people to utilize surveillance technology such ad RFID (radio frequency identification) to track people .
Thus , the controversy over whether or not such use of technology should be banned has been feverishly extended (Bacchetta & Bacchetta , 2005; Marshall , 2009; Sade , 2007; Two stories highlight the RFID debate , 2005) .
Although some people consider such utilization benefits mankind in ways such as security and health care , concerns of loss of privacy and dehumanization , physical risks , as well as problems of identity theft still makes it controversial .
As the banes overweigh the boons in general , such use of technology on people should be banned .
RFID is mainly used on tracking employees and patientsneither is reasonable .
According to a report on July 19 , 2005 (Two stories highlight the RFID debate) , the general workers' union GMB in UK required the European Commission to prohibit the tag of RFID on employees .
As the employees were monitored through RFID and GPS even when using the bathroom , they felt annoying dehumanization and loss of privacy .
Proponents claim that implanting RFID chips makes it possible for employers to watch over who sneaks away even during an unauthorized bathroom break (Albrecht & McIntyre , 2005) .
Though , after weighing the pros and cons , numerous civil rights groups and privacy groups oppose surveillance as a violation of people's right to privacy , including Electronic Privacy Information Center , Electronic Frontier Foundation (Wentworth , 2005) , American Civil Liberties Union (2003) as well as US Department of Justice (2008) .
Thus , it is not acceptable to use RFID to track employees .

Besides undermining employees' rights to privacy , using RFID on patients also remains a big issue .
Advocates of surveillance technology argue that RFID tags provide an alternative to access patients' information and thus , reduce medical errors .
However , based on a CEJA report (Sade , 2007) , the American Medical Association has officially reported on July 17 , 2007 that RIFD devices contain potential physical risks to the user .
Tagging of these small sized devices may allow them to "migrate under the skin" , which makes it hard to extract them .
Moreover , possible electromagnetic interference will result in a lower efficacy of medication .
Hence , the advantage claimed from the proponents is not convincing , and the use of RFID to track patients is also not appropriate .
Apart from the use on tracking employees and patients , use of RFID on consumers also causes problems such as identity theft .
Security experts have warned against using RFID due to the risk of identity theft (Hook , 2005) .
Although advocates have assured the security of tagged peoples' information (Security assurance and RFID technology , 2008) , such assurance is proven invalid when the following case occurred as a counter example .
The METRO Future Store has been reported of loss of loyalty cardholders' personal information due to inappropriate use of technology and inadequate customer disclosures (Scandal: the RFID tag hidden in METRO's loyalty card , 2004) .
Katherine Albrecht , Director of CASPIAN (Consumers Against Supermarket Privacy Invasion and Numbering) , "toured the Future Store on January 31 , 2004" and discovered hidden RFID tags in the store's loyalty cards to shopping carts that track customer movements , as well as RFID tag "deactivation" stations that do not work as claimed (McCullagh , 2004) .
This means not only customers' movements are under detection , but confidential items such as signature and application forms containing personal information are easily accessed via an RFID reader , too .
Such a shocking finding convinces people that the RFID trial is not under secure control and thus should be halted .
In conclusion , using surveillance technology to track people not only brings physical risks to the tagged people , but is also regarded as dehumanizing and unstable .
People who are tagged may face problems ranging from mental and physical discomfort to identity loss .
Thus , it is persuasive that surveillance technology such as RFID should not be banned from tracking people .

The issue of whether to use radio-frequency identification (RFID) to track people has been highly debated ever since it was created .
It may appear that RFID and other surveillance technology have brought benefits to public security and the efficiency to attend to a patient .
In fact , the use of RFID and other surveillance technology brings problems to issues such as our basic privacy , health and the public security .
Therefore , I totally agree that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
Firstly , surveillance technology such as the use of RFID should be banned as it intrudes our privacy .
According to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , Article 12 , it says that 'no one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy , family , home or correspondence , nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation' (United Nations , 1948) .
By using surveillance technology to track people , it violates the privacy of one self , thus it is a very serious offence .
Furthermore , a study has revealed that it is very easy to hack into devices such as RFID cards in passports .
According to the experiment conducted by Researcher Chris Paget who is a Security Consultant at NGS Software Ltd , by using simple gadgets such as Matrics antenna and Motorola reader , we will be able to retrieve personal data from the U .S . passport cards (sixwise .com , 2009) .
Opposition may argue that now passport has a protective RFID-blocking sleeve to prevent intrusion from hackers (sixwise .com , 2009) .
However , as technology advances to prevent such intrusions , hackers and stalkers can advance to break into such protections too .
This means that the personal data of a person can be easily retrieved and it thus violates one's privacy .
Therefore , surveillance technology such as RFID should not be used as it violates the human rights for privacy .
Lastly , surveillance technology like CCTV cameras does not decrease the crime rate .
CCTV cameras are used to "keep an eye" on the public and are said to be a good way of crime prevention .
Opposition argues that with CCTV cameras , criminals will be aware that they are being watched and so it reduces the crime rate .
However , this is not necessary true .
London has more than ten thousand CCTV cameras , however , eighty percent of the crimes are left unsolved (Davenport , 2007) .
This substantially supports that with surveillance technology , it does not reduce the crime rate and enhances public security .
Hence , it is not necessary to use surveillance technology to track people .
To conclude , surveillance technology should not be used as it not only can not help in solving crime and maintain order , it poses a health threat to the people using it and around it as well .
Finally , the use of surveillance technology is a violation to human rights .
Therefore I agree that it should not be used .

Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is a type of surveillance technology which has been used for a while now .
It works by storing and retrieving data using RFID tags .
An RFID tag is a small object which can be attached to or integrated into a product or even a person in order to track them .
Although RFID has been claimed to be a useful technology such as in the identification and tracking of criminals , the use of RFID has aroused considerable controversy especially in the area of privacy concerns .
Shop outlets , employers and even potential crime-doers can use RFID to prey on their desired targets , hence intruding their privacy .
Therefore , surveillance technology such as RFID should not be used to track people .
Firstly , stores can use RFID to track and identify customers without their awareness and price items discriminatively .
Shop outlets can charge customers the maximum amount he or she is prepared to pay instead of selling at the same price to every customer by using RFID tags to observe their shopping habits .
For example , stores would definitely charge higher prices for a customer who is price-insensitive and loves to buy branded goods .
The counterargument could be that RFID can be used to provide a better customer service by knowing their customers' preferences .
However , this is not true for all cases since the use of RFID for the purpose of better service could fall into the hands of unscrupulous sellers who only care for lucrative profits .
This can lead to a strong incentive to interfere with customer privacy .
Hence , to be on the safe side , RFID should not be used for any tracking purposes .
Secondly , the use of RFID would allow the employer to monitor every movement of his employees , whether at work or not , in order to assess the performance of his employees .
The employees may not be aware that their personal information is being collected and how this information is being used .
Thus , the privacy of the employees is being invaded when RFID is used for tracking purposes including tracking someone going to the toilet .
The opposition can claim that there is an existing employment law and privacy act to govern the employees' privacy interests .
The law states that the employer is entitled to monitor worker movements and conduct during working hours , so long as the means employed are fair and reasonable and do not unjustifiably disadvantage employees (Roth 2006) .
However , we have to note that RFID is a special surveillance technology with unique characteristics and implications .
Hence , some special provision may need to be made under the law to account specifically for RFID .
Finally , criminals will be able to use RFID tags to help pick their targets .
For instance , they can attach RFID tags onto wealthy people and this would allow them to track their daily routine and whereabouts and can thus work out their robbing or kidnapping plan .
In addition , terrorists can also use RFID to bomb citizens of a particular nationality by setting the bombs to explode when such citizens are nearby .
However , the opposition argued that another novel surveillance technology will probably be invented to counter against such criminals .
Moreover , the main intention of RFID is to protect the society since the police can use the technology to detect criminals .
The opposition may not be completely correct since it will take time to produce a new technology to close in on the criminals and several crimes would have occurred during this period .
Also , a vicious cycle will be created by the criminals using RFID to attack their targets and followed by the police using RFID to detect those criminals .
There will be no end to this and therefore RFID should not be used to track people .
In conclusion , the use of RFID to track people should be banned , not only because it violates an individual's privacy but it could also encourage more potential criminals to commit atrocities and to stir up the greed within businessmen .
The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned
Firstly , the RFID technology is still immature which means we cannot guaranty both the accuracy of information we get and the harmlessness of these chips implanted in our body .
Actually , when two or more readers want to scan the same tag , the "signals from their scanners may overlap" which will cause the tag "unable to reply" (Reported on Techonovelgy .com) .
We call this reader collision .
Similarly , "tag collision" may occur when "tags are present in a small area" (Reported on Techonovelgy .com) .
Furthermore , the RFID chips work by using electromagnetic waves , which may have some potential harm to our bodies .
However , people may argue that the chips and tags will be tested before using .
As another evidence for this technology's immaturity , there is no "standard" (Campbell , 2004) in this area .
As a result , the organizations which conduct these tests are the RFID companies themselves .
Thus their accuracy and safety declarations are usually not objective .
Secondly , tracking people may result in privacy crisis , which can cause more serious problems .
When you are implanted a RFID chip or taking some objects with RFID tags , the information about your location , your purchase list and so forth can be easily disclosed .
You can never have a leisurely afternoon , because your fellows can always find you during your vocation .
You can never keep your diet a secret , since your neighbors can easily know what you buy for food today .
The RFID supporters may argue that a lot protecting means are provides in this case .
However , they should take note that electromagnetic waves are neither some entity which can be locked in a safe , nor digital data which can be stored in a computer .
"Coding" or "adding pin numbers" to them cannot stop people from getting them (Reported on Technovelgy .com) .
Thirdly , it is purposeless to tracking everyone .
It is true that RFID is really helpful for finding the lost children or tracing thefts .
However , only a very small percentage of people will get lost .
Similarly , not so many products will be stolen .
It will be meaningless and costly to tracking everyone just in case some of them may get lost someday .
Based on the three reasons showing above , the RFID are not reliable enough to give correct information about the tracked person .
Meanwhile , it may invade the users' privacy .
Finally , it is costly as well as unnecessary to tracking people .
Thus , it should be clear that tracking people by RFID should be banned .
Surveillance technology has been an increasingly important tool in both public and private sectors over the 50 years .
It is widely use to monitor the individual's activities and behaviors , for instance , to reduce theft or for security .
The few examples of surveillance technology are digital video recorders , hidden spy cameras and RFID .
RFID will be focus in this context .
RFID stands for"Radio-Frequency Identification" which is a technology that uses radio waves to identify people or objects .
The use of RFID tags on products and humans had raised concern for unauthorized access and invasion of privacy (Sottile , 2005) .
However , I do not agree that surveillance technology such as RFID should not be used in tracking people because of its importance benefits like children kidnapping prevention and elderly health care improvement .
RFID technology , tag or implant , is useful in tracking children for kidnapping prevention .
Mexico ranked the second highest for the number of abductions happened in each year (McHugh , 2004) .
As the kidnapping rates in Mexico rises , a Mexican firm implemented RFID implants to prevent kidnapping .
Xega , a security firm , offered RFID implantation to help in locating kidnap victims and it had been to proven to be successful as the business in booming (Rosenberg , 2008) .
In addition , a fashion designer Lauren Scott came out with a line of children's clothing that uses the RFID tag devices to track a child that have been taken more than 30 feet beyond their home .
The design was sold in the Spring of 2006 (Sottile , 2005) .
Although the parents can make use of such benefit to keep track of their children activities through a RFID reader , however , safely of a child is more important than their privacy .
Thus , RFID can be use to track a child as it can prevent kidnapping .
RFID technology can improve the health care of the elderly .
Researchers from Georgia Institute of Technology and Intel Research Seattle found out that the caregivers can monitor the seniors' daily activities through the data received via internet from the RFID readers and record when and which tagged items they have picked up (Baard , 2004) .
This also means that the elderly will lose their freedom in which food they eat and thing they do .
However , caregivers need the real-time data and record of an individual's normal daily routine for comparison to identify any significant changes which according to the physician and expert on aging , those changes seen often indicate onset of illness and cognitive decline (Baard , 2004) .
Therefore , the use of RFID to track seniors' daily routine can improve their health care through early detection of health problem when they are at home .
In conclusion , RFID is useful to track children activities and seniors' daily routine to prevent kidnapping and improve health care respectively .
I disagree against the idea that surveillance technology such as RFID should not be used to track people as some of its benefits are more important than privacy and freedom concerns .

The use of surveillance technology to track people had become possible due to the advancement in technology .
Among the technologies available , radio- frequency identification (RFID) is emerging mainly due to its ability to transmit information wirelessly via magnetic fields as well as the possibility of low cost tag in the future .
(Michalek , 2008) .
Even though the use of RFID in human tracking could help to improve on the safety and security , there are several threats such as privacy and health hazardous that we need to consider .
Therefore , RFID should not be used to track on people when threats outweigh the benefits of it .
One of the main concerns on RFID tracking would be Privacy issue  .The use of RFID tag on consumer products could track human in an indirect way .
With the function of wireless transmission , manufacturers and retailers would be able to track every single product and hence help to maintain security and keep track of the sale and stock .
The benefits go to the manufacturers and retailers but not the consumers as the ability to keep track of the products that every single consumer bought would expose the identity of the consumer and intrude one's privacy .
(Hamblen  ,2007)  .In hospital  , RFID implant had been used to store patient's clinical information with the claim that it could help to improve on medical services .
It is very hard to ensure that patient's personal information is solely used for clinical beneficial purposes .
Both of previously mentioned usage of RFID faced the same distinct problem which is third party tracking .
(Hamblen  , 2007) .
This is mainly due to the reason that as long as one own's antenna that have could receive the same frequency of as the RFID tag , he would be able to track all the information .
The other main concern would be the health hazardous .
According to some of the research conducted to address on tissue reactions to microchip implants in laboratory animals , 0 .8% to 10 .2% of laboratory mice and 2 cases in dog had developed malignant tumors 2 cases on dog showed that caused by implant chips  .Although the tests were not done on human but the result is relevant to human as human are naturally subject to malignant tumor in response to foreign body implant .
(Albrecht , n .d .)  .One might argue that health hazardous could be eliminated if RFID tag is used to replace the implant chips .
Long term exposure to electromagnetic fields emitted by the antenna could be another health hazardous that could not be treated lightly .
In conclusion , RFID usage in human tracking is not as simple and beneficial as we thought of .
There are a lot of hidden threats such as privacy issue and health hazardous which we should really consider .
Thus , RFID should not be used to track on people .
Technology such as in surveillance had been an integral part of mankind's progress in the past , and it will continue to play a vital role in the 21st century .
There is an increase in the usage of surveillance technology such as radio-frequency identification (RFID) these days especially in passports and hospitals .
These usages of surveillance technology have in many cases , brought about many benefits to mankind but there is also an increasing call for the ban of the usage of surveillance technology to track people as many are concerned with the loss of privacy and the exploitation of personal information .
However , we should never ignore the benefits that surveillance technology brings which outweigh the concerns .
Many countries are beginning to use RFID technology in passports .
By implanting RFID into passports , it will enhance security and at the same time , facilitate travel .
The RFID system will be embedded with the travelers' information and their travel history will also be automatically updated .
In addition , plane tickets implanted with RFID technology can also be issued .
These tickets will have the passengers' information in them and this will help to ensure a much efficient boarding and prevent unauthorized person from boarding the plane (ActiveWave Inc . , 2009) .
Opponent of this position argues that RFID-installed passport is in fact , less secure than normal passport as anyone may be able to attain someone else's personal information with an RFID-reader .
They further argued that information in passport can easily be copied and embedded into a forged passport (Campbell , 2004) .
However , those arguments are not entirely valid as the US State department has highlighted that many precautionary measures have been implemented to prevent such security breaches from happening (Broache , 2006) .
The passport will be installed with a metallic layer which prevents others from obtaining information of the passport holder from a distance .
In addition , the information of the passport will be encrypted into codes and will only readable by authorities that are able to access the database (Broache , 2006) .
Although the use of surveillance technology in passport may not be perfect , with the rapid advancement in technological research , continuous improvement can be done in order to further enhance the security aspect of a passport .
Thus , surveillance technology should be used in tracking people for security purposes .

Use of Implanted Patient-Data Chips Stirs Debate on Medicine vs . Privacy .
The Washington Post .
Retrieved October 4 , 2009 from {http://www .washingtonpost .com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/14/AR2006031402039_2 .html}[HYPERLINK: http://www .washingtonpost .com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/14/AR2006031402039_2 .html]
Another area in which surveillance technology has been widely used is in medical sector .
RFID have proven to be very useful as medical staffs will be able to access the patients' medical and personal information quickly anywhere with just an RFID-reader (Stein , 2006) .
This enable doctors to get to know patients' medical condition quickly especially in time of emergency and also allows the patient's family members to be contacted immediately .
In addition , RFID can also be used for tracking of patients .
Tracking of patients using RFID helps to solve the problem of medical staff searching for patients that were lost when moving about between medical facilities for treatment .
This will raise the efficiency of treatment done in the hospital and also prevent patients from leaving the hospital without receiving full treatment .
According to Cox (2008) , a study was done by Spyglass Consulting Group in 2008 and the result has shown that the usage of RFID technology in hospitals has tripled since its last study in 2005 .
The increasing use of RFID technology in hospitals not only in the United State , but all around the world is a testimony of a growing approval by the medical staffs and general public alike , of the use of RFID technology in hospital .
One's privacy has always been the utmost importance in our society but the benefits brought about by surveillance technology have been numerous and cannot be ignored .
Its wide ranges of benefits especially in term of security and efficiency have definitely improved human lives when used appropriately .
Thus , surveillance technology should be used to track people as we have to use the best technology available to our benefit .

The advances in technology have brought about much convenience to the society of modern times .
Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) is one of it .
RFID is an automatic contact-less identification and data capturing technology using Radio Frequency (RF) signal .
The data can be read from a distance without the need of line of sight .
It can be used to track workers in dangerous working environment and identification of patients in hospitals .
To complete a RFID system , a tag which is known as transponder and a reader which is known as transceiver are used .
The tag emits RF signal which is received by the reader and data will be captured on the computer .
Although there are arguments that using RFID is invading people's privacy , the benefits are more prominent .
Thus , RFID should be used to track people .
RFID is used in dangerous workplaces to help in ensuring the safety of the workers .
Mining fields are one of the places .
Miners have to work in confined spaces with stale air , coal dust and hazardous equipments .
The used of RFID can help to minimize the risk involved .
In China , mining team used KJ-241 personnel and equipments locating system to track their miners (KJ-241 personnel and equipments Locating system for mining , 2007) .
Wearing the RFID tags allows the movements and attendance of the miners to be monitored .
In the case of accidents , the supervisors can get information on the numbers of trapped miners in the mining fields (KJ-241 personnel and equipments Locating system for mining , 2007) and thus able to plan evacuation route .
This will greatly increased the efficiency in dealing with emergency .
Hence , RFID has good use in terms of tracking people .
* RFID tags are difficult to remove (n .d .) .

Hospitals are another area that using RFID to track people can be of great effect .
Patients , doctors nurses do not need to have any RFID chips implanted in them .
They just need to wear removable RFID bracelets to allow the tracking of their movement .
This is especially useful when dealing with at risk patients with alzheimers (Healthcare Solutions n .d .) .
It will dangerous for them to roam around the hospitals alone as there are dangerous equipments and they may cause hindrance to life saving procedures .
Therefore , the hospitals staffs are able to track the patients' movements using the RFID bracelets on them .
The most controversy issue in the used of RFID to track people is the invasion of privacy .
Products bought by consumers may have RFID chips attached on them .
These chips are difficult to remove as they can be as small as half-millimeters squares in size and as thin as paper .
Usually , the chips are placed at area of products that are less visible (RFID tags are difficult to remove n .d .) .
Unknowingly , the movements and information of the consumers are being tracked by the vendors selling the products .
This can be seen as a form of invasion of privacy (Harper ,J .
2004) .
However , the used of RFID to store information can bring about much convenience and efficiency in hospitals .
The tags that patients wear contain their medical records like allergies , family medical history , current medication which the staffs are able to access with the help of RFID reader .
This greatly improves the efficiency in hospitals as compared to the past when all the information are documented in paper (Latest RFID Development Kit for Hospital Tracking Solution n .d .) .
Once again , this shows that RFID should be used to track people .
In conclusion , the used of RFID to track people have more concrete and constructive advantages that can help to save lives .
The miners are able to work with a safe mind as they know their safeties are under monitored .
The used of RFID help to increase work efficiency in hospitals as information are available easier .
Every new technology has its own downside; it is up to the users to fully maximize the positive area .
In this case , the plus points of using RFID to track people outweigh the negative aspects .
Thus we should continue to use RFID to track people .

Title: The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned .
Technological advancement has made it possible to track people using electronic devices .
This inevitably has brought about many debates on the moral and ethical grounds .
There are views that it should be allowed on the ground that such tracking devices actually brings about many benefits , but these benefits comes at a heavy price; our privacy and rights .
Thus the using of surveillance technology should not be allowed .
Installation of surveillance devices are getting common and it is actually demonstration of lack of trust between the management and the employee .
Productivity of the employee is a major concern of the company .
Such devices enable the management to keep an eye on the employees' activities making sure that it is in compliance with the company guideline and performing their duties .
However , taking such a measure by the management is a violation of the employees' rights and privacy .
It will inevitably strain the relationship between the 2 parties and affects employee commitment and motivation towards their work .
In the end productivity of the company suffered as well due to the drastic change in the work culture .
Many surveillance devices like RFID is actually capable of storing information , and hospitals have used it in tagging patient with critical conditions .
The advantage of it is that all the vital medical history of the patient can be easily retrieved if there is a need for emergency procedure .
That would save a lot of preliminary assessment procedures and avoid many unnecessary complications like allergies .
On the surface the devices ability to save life seems remarkable , but it has serious risks of being abused .
Medical history of a patient is confidential , and storing all these information on the RFID tag/chip risk leaking out these information .
It is actually technological feasible to steal such information with just the access to a compatible tag/chip reader .
It is against one rights and privacy if such information got leaked , and prominent figures like celebrities and politicians are most likely the target of these hackers .
In 2006 , RFID was implanted into employees of citywatch .com working in the classified department , this ensure that only authorized personal has the rights to access the sensitive legal data and images .
The usage of such sophistical technology no doubt preserves the integrity of these data , but it gave rise to the concern being tagged against one's will to be remained employed .
The implantations process us a "quick and relatively simple procedures" , but the removal of it is not .
These chips might migrate over the years or was placed too deeply .
Specialist like plastic surgeon and X-ray might be required to remove the chip .
In another word , if one was tagged , he risked being permanently marked for life due to the difficulty of removing the chip .
The use of RFID for tracking purpose exist as early the 1970s by the farmers to keep track of the cattles herd eating and reproductive habits .
It is still common use for tagging of endangered animals to aid in the study of their behavior in order to preserve their population .
Such technology has now being shifted from the animals and to be used on human; it is very degrading and this act displays a total lack of respect towards the tagged personnel .
As mentioned in the earlier passage , the removal of such tag is not easy and it poses a very high risk of leaking out confidential data of the personnel against his wish .
Hence , the use of such tagging devices should remain on the studies of the endangered wildlife and never on human .
In conclusion , the use of surveillance technology on tagging on people poses very high risk in leaking out personal privacy data and it is an invasion of personal privacy .
The removal of implanted chip was not easy even if one wishes to reverse it .
Lastly it is an extremely degrading act to a fellow human , tagging him like a cattles in the farm , and hence the use of surveillance technology like RFID should be banned .
Nowadays in this high pacing society , everything is required to be precise .
Managers want their employees' location at anytime , retailers need information of customers in the store and policeman need identification of the suspicious at the spot .
Therefore , with the emergency of surveillance technology such as RFID , which allows automatic identification of objects , animals or people by incorporating a small electronic chip on its "host"(Europe's Information Society , n .d .) , people's accurate location can be tracked and returned in time .
This results in furious debate in the society since it brings the potential problems about privacy .
However , since the surveillance technology can not only help companies to keep their effectiveness but also assist to secure public safety .
Hence , the use of surveillance technology such as RFID should be necessary .
Another reason of using surveillance technology such as RFID to track people is that it can help to prevent crimes .
On important occasions , when there are a large number of people involved , it is nearly impossible for police and security stuffs to identify the criminals when crime occurs .
However , with the help of the surveillance technology , policeman can identify the crinimals very fast and catch them or pay attention to the suspicious at very first to prevent the crime before it can be committed .
In this way , such technology like RFID can be used to keep public safety .
While those who are against the surveillance technology insist that tracking people with RFID is a kind of intrusion to privacy and it shows disrespect to the individual .
They argue that the potential threaten of RFID is substantial since it contains so much private information , therefore , if abusing RFID will lead to a serious consequence .
However , legislation is already in place national level and data protection authorities have been established to safeguard the unauthorized use of personal data(RFID Consultation , n .d .) .
Furthermore , the authorities have elaborated working documents on Data protection Issues about RFID to rigorously guide RFID deployers on application(RFID Consultation , n .d .) .
Therefore , the data acquired from individuals with RFID will be safely kept to ensure the privacy of the individual .
As the application of surveillance technology such as RFID becoming more common and widespread , the community raised an issue of tracking people using these surveillance technologies will harm human rights .
However , I think that the benefits of such surveillance technologies outweigh its cost of intruding human's privacy .
These technologies are beneficial in medical field , social security and natural disaster rescue or investigation .
There are several applications of surveillance technologies in medical field .
One of them is implanting a RFID chip which contains the medical record of the patient in their body .
This RFID chip plays an important role to let the doctors to access to the patients' medical information when the patients are incapable to communicate ( Ahuja ,A . , 2006 ) .
With this easy access to patients' medical information , the fatality rate due to lack of information available to medical personnel will be reduced dramatically .
A solid example for the benefit of surveillance technology in medical field is the implanting of RFID chip into Alzheimer patients ( Swedberg ,C . , 2009) .
With the help of the chip implanted in these patients , medical personnel will encounter less difficulty in understanding the patients' medical information even if the patients' suffer from loss of memory due to the disease .
Furthermore , surveillance technologies also can be used to improve the social security .
Equipped with these surveillance technologies , our family member can locate us easily and hence decrease the kidnapping rate .
This application is proven to be effective when the Mexican Agency tried to use these surveillance technologies to curb the kidnapping epidemic in the country .
In the same time , United States also implemented the usage of surveillance technologies in their prison to control the violence rate .
The 60% decrease in the violence rate in these prisons proved that surveillance technology is effective in preventing the violence from happening ( {Kanellos}[HYPERLINK: mailto:michael .kanellos@cnet .com] ,M . , 2004) .
Thus , surveillance technologies in tracking people might be a good alternative in preventing criminal act from happening .
In addition , these surveillance technologies are also very effective during the rescue operation or investigation .
Implanted RFID chip can help the rescue team or investigation team to identify the deceased in case they are disfigured or trapped .
As an example , the during the 911 incident rescue operations , the firefighters wrote their badge numbers on their arms so that they could be identified in case they are disfigured or trapped( {Kanellos}[HYPERLINK: mailto:michael .kanellos@cnet .com] ,M . , 2004) .
Thus , it will be much more convenient effective if these firefighters have implanted RFID chip which record their information .
It is no doubt that there are disadvantages in using surveillance technologies in tracking people .
However , surveillance technology is a tool; all technologies can be used in positive or negative way .
Just like the drugs , it can be used as poison but in the same time it is the medicine .
Although applying surveillance technology on people might lead harming human rights , we can minimise this situation by raising the security level of these RFID chip by encrypting the information it contains .
In conclusion , surveillance technology on people is like a double-edge sword .
We have to use it carefully to utilise it to the maximum in the medical field , improving social security and assists in rescues or investigation operations .
With the advances in technology , the use of surveillance technology is inevitable .
This results in the controversy on whether surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) should be banned as it invades privacy .
However , surveillance technology also has its benefits such as security , safety and work efficiency .
Thus , I do not agree that surveillance technology should not be used to track people as the benefits outweigh the problems .
Surveillance technology helps to ensure security in the society .
It is useful in anti-terrorism .
Surveillance technology can be used to track the movement of the terrorists and arrest them before they cause greater damage to the society .
In New York , a group of men are under surveillance as they are suspected in a plot to use homemade bombs to attack New York City commuter trains (Hays & Barrett , 2009) .
With surveillance technology , such incident can be prevented .
Thus , this results in a better security in the society .
Therefore , surveillance technology should be used to track people such as terrorists to ensure better security .
Surveillance technology results in safety in the medical sector .
RFID can be used to monitor patients with Alzheimer's diseases .
This reduces the risk of these patients getting lost .
RFID will able to track their location and find them .
This reduces the chance of patients getting themselves into danger .
Another advantage is that RFID can ensure the safety of infants .
For example , on July 15 , 2005 , with the use of RFID in infant protection system , a baby was prevented from being abducted at Presbyterian Hospital in Charlotte , North Carolina .
An alarm will be triggered if the infant should not be leaving the specific area .
Thus , surveillance technology should be used to track patients and infants to ensure safety .
Surveillance technology can help to increase work efficiency .
In works that involve delivery , RFID can be used to ensure that employees do not go to any unauthorised places or misuse the vehicles during work .
Similar situation can be seen in the military vehicles in Singapore .
The movement of the vehicles are tracked to ensure that soldiers follow their tasks and do not misuse the vehicles for other personal reasons .
Critics of this position claim that it is invading their freedom .
However , during working hours , employees should be following their work .
They should not misuse the vehicles unless it is an emergency .
Thus , surveillance technology should be used to track people to increase work efficiency .
Opponents of surveillance technology argue that surveillance technology invades privacy .
As a result , surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
This argument is insufficient as security and safety are more important than privacy .
Privacy should be compromise for security and safety .
Hence , surveillance technology should be used to track people to allow better security and safety .
In conclusion , surveillance technology results in better security , safety and increases work efficiency .
The benefits of surveillance technology outweigh the problems .
Therefore , I do not agree that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
Humans have many basic needs and one of them is to have an environment that can sustain their lives .
Our current population is 6 billion people and it is still growing exponentially .
This will , if not already , caused problems as there are very limited spaces for us .
The solution can be obtain by using technology to achieve a better usage of space that we have and resolve the problems in lands that inhospitable such as desserts and swamps .
Identification has become more and more important in our society .
Thanks to biometric identification , nowadays , we can open a locked door without keys , withdraw money from the bank without entering password , and travel around the world without taking various cards .
Biometrics , by definition , refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics .
These characteristics include fingerprints , eye retinas and irises , voice patterns , facial patterns and hand measurements .
Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification , this technology is also shaped by three social factors , namely , the desire of the society for safety , convenience and economy .
Safety is one of the crucial problems that many countries and companies concern .
On one hand more and more virus and hack can access personal computers , so the secret data and documents may be stolen .
On the other hand , some important departments need strict administration to their members to avoid information leaks .
The United States Department of Defense (DoD) {Common Access Card}[HYPERLINK: http://en .wikipedia .org/wiki/Common_Access_Card] is a successful use of biometric identification .
This card contains biometric data to add security and reduce the risk of falsification (Ben , 2008) .
As we can see , the biometric identification involved in important secure areas is designed to identify human with accuracy and reliability .
Besides safety , convenience is also desirable for identifications .
We do not want to spend time and effort to remember password , neither do we want to carry any cards or equipments to show our identification .
For government and other organizations , they are also looking for small size equipments and time-saving progress of identification .
Therefore nowadays the biometric identification progress is designed to be very quick , and the equipments can be easily set up or can be combined with other equipments .
We can have fingerprint verification reader combined with built-in smartcard reader , and it only takes seconds to verify one's identification .
The effects of the use of biometric identification are obvious .
With biometric identification , our fingers , faces and even eyes become our identification .
This technology is widely used in our society and it brings benefit to the government , the military , business and every individual .
All in all , biometric identification achieves great development as human seek for better information protection , easier life style and greater economic profit , and it benefits much to those who shaped it .
Nuclear technology had come a long way since Ernest Rutherford first split the atom in 1917 .
The subsequent realization that the additional neutrons produced from fission reaction can induce a nuclear chain reaction sparked off widespread interest in nuclear technology .
Since then , nuclear technology had been through wars , arms races and had found many applications in the medical , industrial and energy fields .
When uranium fission was discovered in 1938 , it sparked widespread scientific interest due to the massive amount of energy released by the reaction .
However most American physicists were still skeptical that it could be turned into a bomb or an energy source .
However , with the world on the brink of war , military considerations would accelerate the development of nuclear technology beyond the imagination of the initial skeptics .
Following fears that Nazi Germany was developing nuclear weaponry , the Manhattan Project was initiated in the United States .
The project eventually grew to include over thirty sites across America dedicated to nuclear research .
The research effort culminated in "Fat Man" and "Little Boy" , two atomic bombs that were dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima respectively .
Although wartime nuclear research brought about nothing but devastation and death , President Eisenhower's "Atoms for Peace" speech would set the world off on the road of peaceful pursuit of nuclear energy .
The development of nuclear technology was also heavily influenced by public opinion , especially after disastrous accidents occurred in nuclear power stations .
The steady growth of nuclear power in the 1960s was hampered by the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in 1979 and the growing voices of the anti-nuclear movement .
The leakage of radioactive gas into the atmosphere prompted the many anti-nuclear demonstrations that sprung up across the America in the following months .
Although the reactor was eventually cleaned up and decontaminated , the damaged dealt to nuclear power was irreversible and caused its subsequent decline .
This is especially evident in the steady drop of the number of nuclear reactors built , a statistic that was rising prior to the accident .
With rising oil prices and growing concerns of global warming , countries are looking to nuclear power to solve the energy needs of tomorrow .
China , the factory of the world , consumes phenomenal amounts of energy to fuel its economic growth .
To partly offset this gigantic demand for energy , China had launched an ambitious program to produce 16% of its electricity from nuclear power by 2030 .
This endeavor to produce more nuclear power have stimulated the development of safer designs of nuclear reactors .
One example is the Pebble Bed reactor , an innovative design that is being actively researched in China .
Safety concerns characterized the basic concept of the Pebble Bed reactor with its passive safety design .
In this design , nuclear fuels are contained in spheres or 'pebbles' of graphite .
Hence the nuclear fuels are contained in a more stable environment .
When machinery failure occurs and reactor temperature increase to extremely high levels , the reactor does not undergo a meltdown or explode , instead temperature just stays at the high level until the heat can be dissipated or cooled by coolant liquids .
In conclusion , nuclear technology development had always been driven by social factors .
World War 2 had given it momentum in its initial research , but it will be mankind's need for a renewable and environmentally friendly energy source that will drive nuclear technology's future developments .
Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas which is trapping heat within the Earth .
As such , global surface temperature has risen by 0 .74 degree Celsius for the past century .
Global warming has brought along devastating problems which will affect the lives of many if ignored .
Engineering can help to address this issue by designing technologies which are capable of producing little or no carbon dioxide .
According to Khandani's article on 'Engineering design process'1 , there are five steps to designing processes .
First of all , we have to define the problem .
One of the main causes of global warming is the excessive release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere .
To reduce heat trap within the atmosphere , carbon dioxide level has to be reduced .
Engineers will have to design technologies which keep carbon dioxide emission to the minimum .
Presently in the market , there are already technologies which can replace present day equipments and emit less carbon dioxide .
However these products are not manufactured in large quantities due to high cost of production and low demand .
As such , engineers will have to design technological products which are able to keep both carbon dioxide emission and cost to the minimum , yet perform as efficiently as the present day products .
Second , engineers have to gather relevant information to assist them in generating ideas to tackle the problem .
As the subject has been discussed for quite some time , relevant information are readily available on the internet and articles in magazines and newspapers .
Third , engineers have to generate multiple solutions to solve the problem .
These solutions may be generated by analyzing existing products to find out how the weaknesses can be improved while retaining the strength .
We must also value-add the product to make it even more attractive .
On top of that , engineers can also obtain a variety of similar products and analyze them together .
Constantly combining ideas will result in better solutions being formulated .
Fourth , engineers have to analyze all the solutions which they have generated and apply professional knowledge to decide on a solution .
Engineers will have to use their technical knowledge to analyze the feasibility of the solutions .
They will then analyze the solutions in the economic and social aspects .
These products have to be sold in the market hence consumers must be convinced that these environmentally friendly products are as good as the present equipment in terms of performance and cost .
Therefore careful analysis of the product has to be made before selecting a solution for testing and implementation .
Last of all , engineers have to test and implement the solution which was selected in the previous step .
According Khandani's article , engineers can test the solution by prototyping or concurrent engineering .
Prototyping involves constructing the prototype and testing it under real conditions .
Full scale production will not take place until extensive testing has been done .
Concurrent engineering requires a prototype to be constructed and the design is fine-tuned along the process .
However this tedious process is made easy through modern computer-aided design , analysis , and manufacturing software .
These computer simulations take significantly shorter time hence it is a preferred choice as it means that the product can be sold in the market in a shorter period of time .
Through the five designing steps , a process can be designed to meet the need to decrease carbon dioxide level .
Engineers design products or systems that meet human needs .
One current human need that should be given priority is the search for renewable resources .
Everywhere in the world , fuel is used extensively .
From large scale power generators to the basic cooking at our homes , fuel is essential for all of these to happen and work .
Research had shown that fuel consumption had increased twenty percent over the last decade , and had projected that the depletion of fuels is drawing .
In addition , burning of fuels emit various harmful gases pollute our fragile environment .
These green house gases are the main cause to worldwide global warming which give rise to further catastrophes such as the rise in global temperature etc .
Engineers around the world had already started on working on this problem .
To guide them in this heavy responsibility of saving the earth , they use a set of simple steps which guide them in engineering a remedy , known as the Engineering Design Process .
This process consists of five major steps , mainly defining the problem , researching on information pertaining to the problem , brainstorming of ideas , filtering of the ideas , and lastly implementing it .
Firstly , we can define this worldwide problem as the search of alternative resources to the existing near-depletion fuels .
Since fuels are non renewable and emit so much harmful gases , the alternatives that we are looking for should be a renewable one and not emit harmful pollutants .
Next , we have to gather relevant information about the problem so that we are able to ensure that the solution we are looking for is able to solve the problem directly .
Studies had shown that an average of 2 lbs (pounds) of fuel is needed to produce 1kilowatt of power .
In addition , we realized that burning of fuels produce the large amount of greenhouse gases .
Thus , the alternative resources we are searching for must be able to produce this large amount of energy to replace fuels , as well as not emitting that huge amount of harmful gases .
After identifying the important factors , engineers proceed on their search for solutions .
They will generate and brainstorm innovative ideas .
Alternatives such as the use of water energy and wind energy are some examples .
With these ideas , we have to analyse and weigh the advantages and disadvantages of them .
An example is water which is a good renewable resource and is plentiful .
However , water energy can only be a small option due to the feasibility .
This is because a large body of water is needed to harness the same energy produced by a small amount of fuel .
All the solutions will be thoroughly analysed by the engineers before coming to a conclusion .
Lastly , the engineers will put their solution to test and ensure that the solution is able to solve the problem .
As such , engineers made use wind turbines and water hydraulic generators to harness the wind and water energy respectively .
It may not be the best option but both sources are renewable and are able to be used to slow down the depleting resource - fuel .
This had shown that the engineering design process is essential in solving problems and it ensures that the problem is thoroughly looked into and ensure that the engineers are generating ideas that target the main problem , the depletion and harmful fuel .
Since the reform and open policy in 1970's , China has been eagerly speeding up on its way to industrialization and flourish .
Although the improvement is apparent , there are still a number of problems hampering engineering design processes for innovations .
Among them , education system and perception of innovation stand out becoming two major difficulties .
Many years ago , the situation is different .
In 1931 , Qian Weichang entered Tsing Hua University , major in history with 0 marks in mathematics and physics .
However , after one year study , he found history not suitable for himself and became interested in physics and showed great talent .
When he appealed to change his major , the professor saw his creativity and eagerness , so he approved the appeal .
After several years researching and studying , Qian Weichang made many great breakthroughs in physics .
However , this kind of story can never be found in modern days .
Recently , a student got a very good result in the National College Entrance Examination (NCEE) , but he did not enter the university which he applied for , because the secondary school offered him  100 ,000 encouraging him to stay another year in secondary school for the next year's NCEE , expecting that he could become the top 1 student in his province .
Creativity is developed by students' exploring through their self-learning .
However , the present education system leads students to another way .
Therefore , the lack of creative qualified human resource seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .
Another big problem is that Chinese people usually do not value innovation enough .
In China , it will take several years for a new technology or new engineering design to be put into practice .
Moreover , many of the patents will never be used in production .
Most factories are not willing to spend money and time on innovation .
This problem significantly discourages engineers to make more effort to do research and design , for they will have little motivation to work hard .
However , in developed countries , people really appreciate innovation .
When a new technology comes out , usually it will be put into use within two or three months .
Therefore , people are well motivated to do research and design , and industry updates frequently .
Finally , great innovation may come .
With the increase in human population , the human race has come to a point where desperate action needs to be taken to feed the millions of people in starvation .
Statistics show that the numbers are only continuing to grow with the existing population explosion .
If the former need is put forward to an engineer , he can view it as a broad topic with many possible solutions .
Some solutions as examples would be to design plants/fertilizers that give higher yield or working with health experts introducing new ways to control population growth .
An engineer would firstly need to define the problem .
Defining it would include a refining of the question at hand to a more straight forward one .
With the current issue being a hungry population to be fed , the definition for this would be that the food production needs to meet the requirements of the people .
The next step towards achieving this goal would be to gather information on certain aspects relating to his "pictured" solution .
For example , if his idea is to produce plants which give much greater yield , he needs to assess the yield of existing plants .
From that point onwards he could design different possible approaches to what he expects to do .
He could genetically modify the plants genome to match with a plant that gives greater product or he could create a new genetic material for a higher yielding food plant .
Looking at this third step we realize why the second stage of an engineering design process of gathering information is important .Once all the information is put together into the different possible solutions , the engineer is put to decide which method out of the lot is suited best for the purpose and if agrees with existing international laws .
At this point also any available detail into the viability of the method is valuable .
Lastly comes the most crucial part of an engineering design process .
This determines how accurate the engineer might have been in his work and also if he looked at nature as a considerable factor during his designing process .
The testing stage is usually either the most rewarding or heart- breaking stage of a design process .
Even though the solution seems perfect according to calculations , there are "nature factors" that we cannot control which still affect any process we carry under the sun .
It is likely that this genetically modified plant was give three hundred percent yield is actually not surviving until harvest .
If that is the case , what the engineer would do is analyze the problem at hand and point out exactly which part of the solution needs to be modified .
Another aspect of great engineers is their ability to optimize processes .
This includes less useless waste , more recyclable waste material and high productivity .
So any engineering process can be continuously modified into a faster , better and greener one .
It is self-explanatory that every engineering design process is naturally a cyclic process .
There is no definite correct solution for the question at hand .
With the many possible solutions , what a smart engineer does he figures the best solution and introduces the best way of executing it , so that the need is fulfilled immediately and effectively .
The process of developing a new product based on innovation is not an easy task for the innovators .
The innovators , who are normally work under Research and Development department , have to recognize the needs from the public or through research , are require to spend countless days and nights to understand the problems , to produce solutions to the problems , to convert the solutions into practical products and to commercialize them .
By diffusion and adoption of the innovation products by the public or specific users , the innovators have to face the consequences .
These are not the only challenges that the innovators are going to deal with .
In order to process from the initial stage of innovation development to the final stage , the most important issue is to have a huge sum of fund for development and commercial purposes .
So , the manufacture company , for example , the company that the innovators are working for , is one of the major investors that is providing the fund .
Innovators required development fund in order to obtain their needs , such as hardware equipments , to work on their prototypes .
But at times , there are some critical situations that happen or affect to the manufacturing company , the innovators somehow get to be involve too .
For example , if the manufacturing company did not earn profit in the market , then in order to reduce the cost and prevent the loss from getting worse , the manufacturing company has to stop funding the innovators for their prototypes development .
Then the innovators have to stop all works for the development .
For another example , during this recent economic downturn , most of the major manufacturing companies are slowing down in manufacturing productions and releasing of new products .
This shows that the manufacturing companies are trying to reduce the unnecessary burden to maintain the companies' stand .
Therefore , this is one of the major factors that will definitely affect the innovators from developing innovation products .
Another challenge that the innovators need to be concern about is commercializing the finalize products .
In this final stage , it is all about how packaging , marketing and distribution of the products .
There are cases that marketing department do not wish to market the innovated products due to various reasons .
For example , the marketing department thinks that the innovated products are not relevant to what the company is selling .
Therefore , the innovated products are unable to meet the consumers .
Another example is the marketing department has set the price of the innovated product too high; therefore , they fail to obtain the sales target for the selling the innovated product .
So , this is another major factor that the innovators have to face .
In brief , innovators have to face many challenges when they want to develop the products .
They have to obtain fund from the investors in order to develop their innovation prototypes and require help from the marketing department to have their innovation products for sales in the marketplace .
However , these procedures might become another challenges for the innovators .
Engineering design is defined as a process that brings ideas or theories into physical representations which satisfies human needs .
In an engineering design , there are usually five steps: define problems , gather related information , generate various solutions , analyze and select a solution and test and modify the solution .
Because Engineering designs are always related to real problem , during the five processes , the obstacles they face are more than theories and calculations on paper .
The obstacles for engineering designs may differ from nation to nation .
In my home country , China , the two most representative problems are political issues and financial issues .
Political issues usually become realized in the beginning and final steps , especially in the last step .
In the beginning step , we have to define the problem in a clear and unambiguous way .
Besides , a clear recognition of the real need is also important .
However , in some cities of China , the government wants to minimize the time spending on problem solving process to show their ability in handling problems and force the engineers to skip the first step or just accept the information the government provides .
And in the end such a design may turn to be useless as it does not meet people's demand .
In the last step of design , political issues also disturb the process significantly .
For example , in my hometown Harbin , the government decided to develop an underground traffic system .
This design was welcomed by most of the citizens and the whole design process was carefully carried out .
However , when the design had been carried out for a few weeks , it was stopped .
The government's explanation was because of safety consideration for earthquakes and some other disasters .
But such explanation was of non-sense as the engineers did not see such possibility during their designing; otherwise the design would not be carried out at all .
Some evidences showed that the reason of halt of work was that the higher level of authorities thought an underground traffic system was not necessary for Harbin .
In this example , there is nothing wrong with the original design work , but the design still cannot be carried out due to political inconsistent between the city government and higher level authorities .
The similarities of political obstacles in both two steps are that such problems cannot be easily solved by the engineering group , in other words , the political problems are unavoidable to some degree .
In conclusion , the two most significant problems that hamper the engineering design process are political and financial problems .
Both of these two problems , though affecting different processes , can lead to a completely failure of a project .
Therefore , governments and authorities should pay more attention to these problems in order to get better design work for the country .
Legend has it that the world is created by God .
This may be true; however , God didn't give us a perfect world .
Humankind always has needs and demands because people want to lead more comfortable and easier life .
So , they try to invent things which could help them achieve their goals .
Therefore , in modern society , engineering has become more important; the role of an engineer is to design a safe and efficient product or a system that minimizes the damages to the environment or brings benefits to the human kind .
There are various fields which engineering plays an important role in our daily lives , such as entertainment , healthcare , transportation , real estate , and so on .
As what Khandani(2005) said , a company's survival depends on whether its products are in high demand by the society or not .
Most companies are more interested to invent entertainment electronic goods such as flat LCD screens , smaller and smaller mp3/mp4 players , touch screen hand phones , more portable laptops , and so on which are most demanded in the market .
Though these products are highly sought-after and trendy , they are not the most essential things to people unlike healthcare products .
For example , a person can lead his life peacefully without a laptop or hand phone , but , can a person survive happily with the absence of good health ?
The answer should be 'No' as health is the first priority in a person's life .
If a person is feeling unwell , he will have no mood to enjoy any other facilities and products .
Thus , one current human need that should be given priority is nothing else than healthcare products .
Among quite a number of healthcare products available in market , prosthetic limbs play one the most important roles .
Prosthetic limbs are artificial legs or arms which replace the missing parts of the body .
They are needed for various reasons , including congenital defects , accidents or because of some diseases .
Losing a body part can make a person's life miserable .
They may lose not only mobility but also self-confidence .
In this case , prosthetics limbs can help those disabled people to regain their mobility and confidence .
So , designing the prosthetic limbs should be encouraged as it can really change a person's life .
According to Khandani(2005) ,to design an efficient and safe artificial limb may usually need five basic design processes which are defining the problem , gathering pertinent information , generating possible solutions , analyzing and selecting the best possible solution and finally testing and implementing it .
When defining the problem , the cost , safety and liability , comfort , ergonomic and simplicity must be taken into account .
For example , most of the disabled cannot afford to spend a lot of money on those prosthetic limbs or some of them have an allergy to the materials used in the product .
Before considering the possible solutions , we need to collect all the information that relates to the problem so that we can avoid redefinition and wasting time .
After we confirm that the problem is real and a new solution is needed , we then proceed to step 3 in which we have to brainstorm the multiple solutions .
In this step , we can do it in two ways: to improve the existing idea by finding out the weaknesses or to come up with a totally new and creative idea by researching and testing .
Once we have alternative solutions to the design problem , we can analyze them and decide which one should be the most suitable for the needs .
Finally , we can implement and test the design we have chosen and if we find any problems , we can go back to step 4 and select another solution .
Well designed prosthetic legs can give a disabled person a new taste of life .
According to the article about an amputee sprinter , Oscar Pistorius , who does not have both legs but wants to take part in 2008 Olympics with his J-shaped blades(artificial legs) made of carbon fibers , confidently said that " there is nothing he cannot do that able-bodied athletes can do ."
This is the proof that how a successful design can be beneficial to a needy person .
To sum up , apart from the prosthetic legs , there are still many other areas in healthcare industry that need to be improved such as artificial kidney , artificial hearts , pacemakers , medical imaging and diagnosis devices which are very advantageous to humankind .
Government should also more encouraging the research and development of these products .
With the systematic design processing , there will be more upcoming amazing healthcare products in the future .
In present days , engineers need to be creative and innovative in order to come up with new products .
However , there are many problems that will hinder the engineering design process .
We will focus our attention on the component decision process which will determine the type of raw materials to be used and the safety of the end product .
The cost of raw materials has risen significantly from the year 2003 to year 2009 and it has affected the electronics supply chain .
We will look at two very important components in the manufacture of electronic components , gold and copper .
From the points above , we can see that due to the increasing price of raw materials , it is very difficult to come up with new products consistently as it is very costly to build them .
High selling price of the product will often deter potential customers and hence result in a fall of profit .
Lastly , engineers must ensure that the product must be safe to use or it will end up not only spoiling the reputation of the company , it may even injure or kill someone .
1"Trends in the Costs of Raw Materials ."
2003-2009
<http:// www .ttiinc .com/page/ME_Materials> .
The price of gold has risen from about US$380/troy ounce in June 2003 to about US$960/troy ounce in June 2009 ("Trend") .1 Gold is a very important component in electrical conductivity and thus often used in contact points such as the communicating interface between the graphics card and the motherboard .
Hence designs that need large amount of gold may not be feasible .
Another component is copper .
Copper has good electrical conductivity which allows the conductor channel lengths and widths to be significantly reduced .
This results in faster operating speed and greater circuit integration .
However , the price of copper has risen from about US$1900/tonne in June 2003 to about US$6200/tonne in June 2009 ("Trend") .1
When engineers turn to other types of cheaper materials , some functions and accuracy of the end product may be sacrificed .
However , if the engineers were to stick to their original design , the cost of the end product will be high .
The high cost of the product may deter possible customers and in the end , the profit of the company will drop .
Next we will look at product safety .
The main idea of safety in a product is to ensure that the utilization of the product does not cause any injury or death to the user .
One example would be the grounding of electronic devices .
When electronic devices are not grounded properly , there is a probability that the user might get an electric shock when he/she accidentally come into contact with the device .
If the current is very strong , there is even a chance that the user may die .
Another example would be the cases of Apple's iPhone .
There are many reports around the internet and on newspaper stating that some users' iPhone exploded and the main cause is due to the overheating of the lithium- ion battery .
Hazardous product can tarnish the reputation of the company and sometimes even result in the loss of innocent lives .
Thus it is very important for engineers to do repeated trial test of the product to ensure that it is free of faults .
Engineering design process can be defined as a process fused by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current on to cater to desired deeds .
This process has always been seen indispensable as part of the country's economical growth in the manufacturing sector .
However , the results of the recent National Innovation System (NIS) survey show that Singapore has a long way to go in its development of an innovation-based economy , especially in comparison to the other OECD countries .
As we understand the relevance and importance of engineering design , we will come to realize that in reality there are several factors that preventing the progress of engineering design .
Firstly , engineering design process has come to incur excessive costs .
Due to high global demand in the world's limited natural raw materials , the prices of copper and silicon have rocketed sky high .
Engineering processes for innovations such as the wafer fabrication and semi-conductor industries are directly affected by the prices of the raw materials .
As a result , research and development in these fields have become way costlier compared to previous years .
In Singapore , there is only a certain fixed amount in the country's national budget allocated of the research and development sector .
It is more expensive to conduct creative engineering research; therefore it is inevitable that a slight reluctance in contributing more assets to engineering design by the government; the reality of the support given by the government is weak .
Moreover , the government has also other financial plans in spending their resources .
Some feel that in these tough economical times , it is wiser to splurge the money on restructuring the economy or providing more incentives to instill entrepreneurship , rather than investing in research in engineering design .
Hence , the area of innovative research and development in engineering is not driven in full swing .
Secondly , the amount of creative people in Singapore is small , which may be a major reason for the hampering of innovative engineering design .
The population of Singapore is scarce compared to other countries in the region .
In countries like China and India , their population amount to billions whereas the population of Singapore is only 4 .5 million .
The fact that Singapore has limited human resource limits the number of creative people in the country .
For example , five percent of the population in Singapore is 1000 times lesser than five percent of the population in the China .
As a result , the number of creative Singaporeans would be much lower relative to other countries .
Although there are many Singaporean-based driven engineering design projects like NEWater plants , much of our economical success due to engineering design is highly dependent on other countries .
For example , most of our latest mass spectrometry equipment used in the area of engineering design is largely obtained from Germany .
In areas of mechanical engineering , our latest machineries are either bought or are replicas from the models in Japan .
The impact on having a limited amount of creative people has resulted in Singapore having to resort to buying foreign-based engineering design equipment from overseas .
In conclusion , even though we realize the importance of engineering design processes in innovation , there are still problems like rising costs and population scarcity problem that hinders the progress of the engineering process .
Serendipity is usually defined as a discovery under an accidental case , and it often results the invention of a new technology .
One typical example is the invention of "post-it" notes .
Serendipity-based technology has some similarities and differences with technology developed through research , for example: the technology of refrigerator .
Firstly , both serendipity-based technology and technology developed via research are initiated by the realization of problems and needs .
When people encounter problems or have demands on certain things , usually they will try to solve the problems through research and development .
The invention of refrigerator was around 1910s as before that , people had faced the problem of food storage in summer when there was no icehouse could be used .
Research and development had been done to solve this problem and eventually boosted the invention of refrigerator .
This is how most conventional technologies been invented .
Similarly , bearing the problems and needs in mind , when unexpected experiment or research results come up to the researchers or scientists , accidentally they would just apply these to solve some other problems totally unrelated .
Post-it note was invented in this way according to Rogers .
3M , famous Scotch tape company , discovered an unsuccessful bonding agent that could not stick paper tightly hundreds years ago .
However , the 3M researchers found out this failed bonding agent was suitable for attaching notes which satisfy many people's needs .
Thus post-it note was invented from this idea .
In this manner , many other serendipitous technologies have been discovered and solved many irrelevant problems .
Thus , it is fair to say that either conventional technology or serendipitous technology is stimulated by the realization of problems and needs .
Besides the similarities , there are some differences between research-based technology and serendipitous technology .
Firstly and most significantly , for conventional technology , a process of research is required .
Research is usually based on certain organizations and it requires some time , funds and resources before the researchers can finally obtain the expected results .
For the invention of refrigerator , many companies like: General Electric , Kelvinator and Postum , did organized the research group to invent and develop refrigerator .
However , for serendipitous technology , research is not a necessary process .
Many new ideas may just generate from daily life , some mistakes made accidentally or during research for other technology .
For the post-it pads , its idea was just generated from the failed product when 3M researches tried to invent new bonding agent .
Also , serendipitous new ideas can be generated by anyone .
The only challenge is whether or not they can grab the opportunity and do further development to make the ideas into useful technologies .
Yet for conventional technology , it is limited to people with professional knowledge , like: researchers or scientists .
In conclusion , although serendipitous technology seems easier than research-based technology for research process , it still requires a lot of hard work to further develop it and one should acquire the essential knowledge before he know how the unexpected discoveries can been used to solve the problems we faced .
Thus , a serendipitous technology can be seen as a conventional technology with less research .
With the rapid development of modern society , engineering innovation is of increasingly great importance to the global community and human beings .
In different parts of the world , however , there are various factors which slow down the process of industrial designing , and China , my home country , cannot make an exception .
Compared to technical reasons , social reasons are the main obstacles for inventions , and finance and education stand out from all these reasons .
It is very complicated to find out reasons hindering innovation in China while finance and education do have some effect on it .
Despite the obstacles mentioned above , China is now moving its focus to build an innovation-encouraged society .
I believe these problems obstructing engineering innovation will be solved in the near future .
In today's context where failures are condemned and successes are applauded , scientists , researchers and engineers are expected to discover new technologies and innovations which are exact and practical the first time round .
This is also illuminated in organisations and bureaucracies , which are structured to provide stability and continuity , being inflexible towards nurturing innovations (Rogers , 2003) because failures will tarnish their reputations .
Henceforth , inventors with company leaders begin to adopt a secretive approach towards inventions and they go "underground" for research and development .
This is termed as skunkwork .
Understanding the differences and similarities between such a path that inventors take and conventionally generated technologies will help us to better appreciate their efforts & the hardships they had to go through in their endeavours .
Despite their seemingly fishy name , skunkworks are actually maintained and driven by professional individuals , highly trained in specific fields , similar to personnel who are involved in conventionally generated technologies .
During the pioneer year of the National University of Singapore's Formula Society of Automotive Engineering (NUS FSAE) , outstanding undergraduates who show exceptional talents and skills among their peers were being selected to work on a new project of building an eco-friendly race car to compete on the international platform .
Having considered the uncertainties and their inexperience towards the new project , the team had to keep a low profile and work behind closed doors as the university's reputation was at stake if they were to fail .
Another similarity between skunkworks and conventionally generated technologies will be that both are given adequate funds and resources by the authority to maintain their operations .
Being a highly classified project , the Lockheed's Advanced Development Projects Division , a American aerospace company was funded by the government to develop the latest aircraft to fight in World War two (Roger , 2003) .
Likewise , the Singapore government has also invested heavily on the transportation system in her plan to build better and cost efficient MRT stations over the next 6 years (STBT , September 2009) .
The provision of funds and resources are critical towards the productivity of researches and innovations .
However , in order to escape routine organizational procedures , inventors and researches working in skunkwork environment are more often abused in contrast to the people working under conventional system .
This is because , with little supervision , working conditions and workplace safety are often unregulated and compromised .
The creation of the Macintosh was the collaborated effort of fifty computer designers who worked day and night under an abusive and aggressive leadership (Roger , 2003) .
On the other hand , under the conventional system , innovators are supposed to abide to strict workplace safety , guidelines and routine organizational procedures .
They work under conducive environment to accomplish their tasks .
To conclude , both skunkworks and conventionally generated technologies are undertaken by a group of professionals who are given adequate funds and resources .
However , they receive different forms of treatments and work under different environments .
This is to meet the society's expectation for them to come out with inventions which are correct the first time round .
From past to present , many important innovations have surfaced .
Some of these innovations were shaped by technology while others were created from the needs and desires of society .
A crucial invention which has eased man's ways of living is the aircraft .
According to (AVIATION , 2009) "Centuries of dreaming preceded the first successful flight" which suggests that the basis of this innovation was from man's dream to fly like birds they see in the sky .
Hence aircrafts were a socially determined technology which has developed over time , catering to the needs of humanity .
Firstly , military aspects were crucial in shaping the aircraft .
Planes of present versus those in the past show a noticeable improvement in agility and speed .
In World War I (WWI) for example , planes were fairy slower and more bulky , as mentioned by (AVIATION , 2009) "Huge biplane bombers with two , three , or four engines were introduced in World War I" .
However , the military learnt from the fighting techniques used in combats during WWI and required aircrafts able to negotiate tighter turns and break the speed of sound so as to evade enemies or catch up with them .
World War Two showed improvements in the design and ability of aircrafts , making them smaller and therefore swifter .
Adding on , fighters of today are even more advanced and able to break the sound barrier .
Take for example the "F-15 Eagle , which excels at air-to-air defence tactics and has a maximum speed of over Mach 2 .5" or "the F-16 Falcon , a highly maneuverable all-purpose fighter-bomber" (AIRPLANE , 2009) .
These planes are not only a mark of development in speed but also in agility .
Most importantly , we see that these needs of the military were a driving force behind the development and enhancement of the aircraft .
In conclusion , the aircraft , a socially determined technology , has developed from its ancient clumsy and slow predecessors to their new age , swift and agile successors .
These modifications were indeed not possible if not for the varying social as well as military requirements during different eras .

When there is a need for something , a technology is create to solve the problem .
The same applies for an eco-friendly car .
There are many factors that contribute to the creation of the eco-friendly car .
The factors are - political , economical , technological , environmental and social .
In 2006 , a documentary film , An Inconvenient Truth , written by former United States Vice President Al Gore , has sparked a series of heated discussions after it was being screened in cinemas .
It sent a message to the world about the drastic environmental changes due to decades of environmental abuse by mankind and what will happen if we choose to ignore this issue .
Subsequent actions were taken by the American government to administer a regulation that car companies could only sell ninety percent of cars with normal machinations while the other ten percent had to be eco friendly cars .
This implies that automobile companies had to pull in large sums of money for research and development work to create and promote the sales of such cars .
Without pressure from the government , no automobile company would have taken the initiative to manufacture and market out these vehicles .
Economic factors stressed the need for eco-friendly cars .
However the cost to finance this project will be high as much research and development have to be done .
Even though it is expensive to develop eco-friendly cars as they cost around two to three times more compared to gasoline powered cars; however this move is vital due to the slow depletion of natural resources for vehicle consumption as it leads to the increment of fuel prices .
In the long run , it will not be economically viable to own a gasoline powered car .
One of the main purposes of the creation of eco friendly cars is due to environmental factors .
The need to reduce pollution levels plays a very important role .
Since the past decade , people are getting more conscious of the damages that we have been inflicting to the Earth .
As mentioned , the Inconvenient Truth has shown that there is a direct link between carbon emissions and the rising temperatures of the Earth .
Statistics have shown that in the past century , carbon emissions have sky rocketed to ridiculously high levels and carbon emissions mainly comes from us humans when we burn fossil fuels for our own usage .
As carbon dioxide "stocks up" in the atmosphere over years , it traps the Sun's heat , thus creating global warming which eventually leads to various climate changes .
Using eco- friendly cars would reduce the carbon emissions per car drastically .
One of the first things we can do to help conserve the environment is to switch from gasoline cars to eco-friendly cars , that is if we already a car .
As awareness of the effects of climate changes grows , people realize that it is their social responsibility to try to undo the environment damages to the best their ability .
Hence more people are seeking for greener alternatives .
Even British Prime Minister , Gordon Brown has urged that all cars in Britain to be green by 2020 .
In conclusion , the creation of eco-friendly cars are shaped by the factors mentioned above and I believe that not only this creation is one of a kind; it is here to stay and also one of the key creations for the future generations to further develop .
In this rapid economic development of the 21st century , the demand for energy is increasing .
However , the Earth can only provide our limited energy .
We cannot increase the amount of fossil fuel use .
Dwindling reserves of fossil fuels on the basis that no matter how slow this process may be , we need to look at other ways to produce energy .
Hence , the use of renewable energy is very important , in our planet's future development .
There many alternative source of energy can be used and applied in our life , such as solar energy , light energy , wind energy , water power and so on .
All of these alternative sources of energy not only help reduce our dependence on non-renewable energy sources , but also these renewable energy power generation processes are friendlier environment .
Currently , people realise the features of environmental protection and the economical efficiency of the solar energy; the use of solar energy is made use of more and more widespread in the ordinary life .
The 21st century is faced with a severe problem of global energy shortage .
Industries require resources such as electricity , oil and petroleum for varies outputs .
The rate of energy consumption by human is much higher than what nature is able to produce .
Therefore , the last decade has witnessed the increasing energy price due to insufficient supply of energy .
For example , the oil price increased from $15 .77/bbl in 1998 to $91 .35/bbl in 2008 (InflationData .com) .
The 479% jump within 10 years implies that actions must be taken to solve the problem .
According to Khandani (2005) , engineering design activities are conducted in order to meet human needs .
In response to energy shortage , engineers design more efficient products and systems .
Among the solutions such as establishing energy-intense industry and recycling natural resources , finding alterative resources seems to be the best solution to provide sustainable supply of energy for varies industries .
To conclude , engineering design process can be applied to help solve the current problem of global energy shortage .
A variety of natural and renewable energies can be considered as alternative energy resources .
If engineers are capable of introducing environmental friendly energies with reasonable cost and sufficient quality , we can expect a future balance between energy consumption and energy supply .
Technologies are always developed to cater certain needs of people , whether to provide better methods of doing things or to develop tools that facilitate working and living .
Technologies are also consistently refined to meet changing needs of customers .
This also applies to virtual technology , which was developed under a specific social and technological background and was evolved to meet increasing needs under a changing environment .
Virtual technology was first developed to address needs of extensive communications .
By the 20th century , with the development of modern technology , communications had been made more and more convenient .
Such excitements brought by modern technologies had boomed the demand for more extensive interactions , not only with friends but also with strangers .
At the same time , new technologies had also brought privacy into people's consideration .
Thus , it was not surprised to observe an increasing need for a convenient and cost effective platform where a large group of people are able to communicate , transcending geographic barriers , while retaining a certain level of independence and privacy at the same time .
To address such increasing social needs , the concept of a virtual world was taken into consideration .
Virtual technology has been designed with a series of unique properties to address the observed social needs by engaging a large user population .
A multi-user online environment was created , allowing a large group of people to get connected at the same time .
This has made interactions among a great number of users become possible .
The user-friendly operation platform designed has made virtual world more accepted by the public and the simplified operation process has also made virtual technology more adaptable to lay men .
In addition , with the establishment of facilities and the popularization of computers , virtual technology has become more and more accessible and has engaged increasing number of people .
The low cost of virtual technology , as compared with that of other types of communications such as telephone , has also attracted numerous users .
As social environment changed , the initial virtual technology developed had become insufficient to meet increased social needs .
Virtual technology was hence refined to meet the evolving needs .
Factors such as the business environment , changing educational styles and new military demands have shaped the development of virtual technology and solutions made used of virtual technology were designed to address each specific need .
The development of virtual technology has been largely influenced by the world's booming economics since early 21st century .
New technologies had made people realize the underlying economic opportunities beyond geographic barriers and national boundaries .
People were looking for more convenient and cost effective methods for transactions and business cooperation .
Catering to this need , a series of solutions has been developed based on virtual technology .
One of them was E-commerce where a virtual interface was created for convenient and efficient transactions of goods and services .
Another example would be E-conferencing which allows a staff to attend live conferences during business trips and has made business process much more efficient .
Virtual technology has also been developed to meet educational needs .
This is especially applied to places where educational resources are limited due to geographic barriers .
E-learning has provided an alternative way to attending lessons conducted by teachers in classrooms .
It has not only made education in such areas possible but also made education more cost effective .
In addition , E-learning has developed a new style of education where self-initiated learning is advocated .
Another example of virtual technology being developed to meet educational needs would be business simulation games where the real business environment is simulated and students can learn from imitated real-life practice .
Such business simulation games have been largely used as innovative learning tools in world's business schools .
Apart from the demands from business and education , other factors have also shaped the development of virtual technology and solutions have been designed to meet the needs .
An example could be the virtual training used by the U .S . army where military demands have shaped the development of virtual technology .
To sum up , virtual technology , like other types of technologies , was determined socially and was evolved to meet changing needs of the society .
The development of virtual technology is shaped by social factors such as the business environment , educational needs and military demands .
This is because technologies are meant to serve people .
Hence , only those innovations and technologies that solve social problems and cater to social needs are considered to be meaningful .
The sustainable development of China's economy largely depends on the progress of science and technology .
Meanwhile , the level of development of science and technology is an important symbol on behalf of a country's strength .
"Innovation" is a popular word around the world these days , and there are myriad of facts to show the importance of scientific and technical innovation .
However , problems inevitably generate and affect the process of innovation due to the improper strategies or methods .
As far as I can concern , there are two major problems in China .
One is that some engineering designs do not meet the needs of market .
In other words , these designs are produced without adequate market survey , so they turn out to be unwelcomed among public .
Though the designs are products of fantastic conception , they become useless as rubbish once out of market .
After the policy of reform and opening-up , Chinese government has long been encouraging people to make varieties of innovations .
Nevertheless , it does not mean that whatever designs can be made .
The key is still the needs of market .
In addition , among all applicants of patents , individuals are the major part .
Individual has an obvious disadvantage compared with teamwork , and that is to say individual cannot handle everything well at the same time .
Without market survey and access to sale or adoption of the market , it is inadvisable to make deigns blindly by divorcing oneself from reality .
No amount of them is meaningful .
In conclusion , China is sparing no efforts to solve problems in order to make innovations real intellectual product .
The principles are establishing a perfect patent system based on the market need .
The emphasis should be put on the propaganda of intellectual rights protection , so that people can understand its importance and learn to protect their rights .
Problems hamper engineering design processes of innovations in China and the effects
Every country will encounter problems in their development .
As a developing country , now China is facing problems on many fields .
This essay discusses two problems which significantly hamper engineering design processes of innovations in China .
The two problems are the situation of education and public policy on industry .
The problems bring some effect on engineering design from two aspect , independent innovation and engineering application .
First , the situation of education in China is a problem for innovation .
It is accepted that Chinese student are good at science .
They have solid foundation on math and physics , they can solve complex and difficult problems in short time .
However , these are just results of long-term training .
China's education is typical exam-oriented education .
Now , this situation has become a problem for the nation that the generation at present age is lack of creativity and innovation ability .
In China's education system , students are only required to receive knowledge and repeat exercising to consolidate knowledge but neglect to explore .
Chinese students are taught to remember many formulas and {solution approach}[HYPERLINK: dict://key .0895DFE8DB67F9409DB285590D870EDD/solution%20approach]es rather than ask questions .
Under this mode of education for long time , people's thinking is limited and rigid .
The president of {Chinese University of Science and Technology}[HYPERLINK: dict://key .0895DFE8DB67F9409DB285590D870EDD/Chinese%20University%20of%20Science%20and%20Technology] pointed that students' lacking of innovation would become the bottleneck of development of China in the future CITATION You05 \l 2052 (You , 2005) .
Besides , there are still many inadequacies in the policy of science and industry .
In China , economic policy is very wide but policy on industry is strict .
For example , investment and concerns that the nation put on technology research and engineering are deficient (Xin , 2005) .
Engineering design is inventions-devices which need many support to gather technologies and solve problems in practice .
However , the policy of engineering and industry cannot meet the needs .
The state only put investment on specialized research institutes .
In the actual production and application , the support from government is not nearly enough .
The two problems would bring some effects on engineering design and innovation for China .
First , under the mode of education , most engineers and scientist are relatively weak at creativity .
This will directly affects the process on engineering design of innovation especially on raising solutions .
In the technological age , since independent innovation is very important to a nation's development , society needs the people with innovative talent .
Engineers need to generate multiple solutions based on different conditions instead of merely learning from other countries' research and findings .
If engineers do not come up with new ideas , they cannot find best solution for the problems .
Moreover , the policy on science and engineering also affects process of engineering application due to insufficient investment in research and engineering practice .
Engineers cannot use the most advanced equipment to do analysis and testing .
Many theories cannot be put into implement .
As a result , the engineering design would be in slow progress and there are still a lot of complex problems left unsolved .
In conclusion , the structure of education and policy on engineering and industry are two significant problems which hamper engineering design process of innovation in China .
If engineers are in defect of creativity and innovation , it is difficult for them to study new issues and make improvement .
At the same time , without enough support , development of engineering design would proceed slowly .
China , for decades , has been called "world factory" by the rest of the world .
Since the economic downturn spread all over the world , China has been regarded as the engine that will pull the world out of recession .
Although China is expected to prosper by a lot of people and countries , there are still problems that hamper its development .
This article will focus on two major problems that hamper innovational process of engineering in China and their impact on certain stage of the process .
In addition to China's low-end industrial structure , the bad situation of intellectual property protection also hampers engineering innovational process .
In China intellectual property right is not well-protected .
People can find pirate version of software in most cities .
There are some products which directly copy the design of foreign companies .
Due to certain reasons , this situation is not expected to improve a lot in the near future .
Since the right of inventors and innovators is not well-protected , people are unwilling to create new products .
Therefore , innovation is discouraged by lack of protection for intellectual property in society .
To sum up , China's low-end industrial structure and bad situation of intellectual property protection are the two major problems that hamper engineering design process in China .
Low-end production pattern makes companies focus on cutting cost , rather than making innovation , while lack of protection for innovation makes people unwilling to generate new ideas .
When China tries to promote engineering design process for innovations , these are the two problems China should tackle .
On September 4th , 2009 , a piece of startling news was popped up and quickly spread out all over the world .
After several years' effort , magnetic monopole was detected by the researchers from the Helmholtz- Zentrum Berlin fur Materialien und Energie have , in cooperation with colleagues from Dresden , St . Andrews , La Plata and Oxford (Magnetic Monopoles Detected In A Real Magnet For The First Time , 2009) .
Obviously , the discovery of magnetic monopole indicated a great progress in pyhsics field .
People may think about what led the success of the discovery of magnetic monopole .
Generally speaking , the development of technologies is always viewed as technologically determined or socially determined .
In this case , the discovery of magnetic monopole was most likely to be promoted by advanced technologies .
However , social determinist , which can be defined as technology is boosted by social factors , is also an important factor in the development of technologies .
To specify , social determinist can be further categorized into several distinguished factors , such as economic factors , military demands , and government policies .
Nowadays it is common to see a person carry a laptop everywhere , which was unimaginable thirty years ago .
While , the appearance of laptop was due to the working demands from workers in company .
During the old days , there was no laptop , but got only desktop that workers had to share one machine to do their mass work , which caused great inconvenience .
In order to solve this problem , a person called Mizoguchi in Toshiba Company came up with the idea of inventing laptop (Rogers , 2003) .
With the help of engineers , he finally invented the laptop that we use every day now , and undoubtedly , his achievement made a great success in computer marketing .
Till now , laptop is still a necessary tool in people's daily life .
One of the reasons for its success was that laptop catered to people's needs greatly .
Thus , after briefly viewing the development of laptop , we can conclude that , the appearance of this marvelous invention was initially driven by the demands of people , and then its development was supported by technologies .
For many years , people have always been trying to come up with some technical innovations to be environmentally beneficial .
Naturally , electric cars were invented .
Instead of using gasoline , electric cars used only battery power , which no more caused air pollution and reduced the cost as well (Rogers , 2003) .
However , in the consideration that electric cars could not travel far distance , and it was not convenient to get battery charged , electric cars finally lost out in the market , due to the restriction of usefulness .
Nevertheless , electric cars is still regarded as a great trial innovation , which still need further technology support to make improvement .
From the examples in the context above , we can conclude that generally , the development of technology is determined by both technological factors as well as social factors .
More precisely , the appearance of a new innovation is initially motivated by socially determinist , and then it needs technological support in the process of development .
Last but least , any technology must be well designed using advance technology skills , otherwise it will most likely to lose out in the market .
According to Khandani (2005) , inventions are actually accumulated on the basis of original technologies which aim to satisfy people's needs .
This is undoubtedly true because that inventions throughout history have greatly improved the quality of people's lives , and people's endless desires have stimulated development of new technologies .
In the 21st century , new desires , as well as new problems have emerged , such as environment pollution , bionics , exploration of outer-space and so on .
Among all of these needs , the most urgent and necessary technologies should be the ones that cope with the effect of global warming .
Indeed , the overwhelming effects of rising temperatures and average sea-levels have threatened the survival of humans possibly in the near future .
In recent years , numerous hypotheses and inventions have been raised .
Among the possible solutions to global warming , the prior technology that should be developed is solar cars , because it could not only effectively reduce the emission of greenhouse gases , but also take advantages of natural resources .
Moreover , solar cars take advantages of solar energy which is approachable .and cheap .
In this way , people no longer have to worry about the exhaust of gasoline resources .
Besides , using solar energy actually cost nothing , which ensures that solar cars could be affordable in the long run .
However , solar cars are still not popular in the market due to the high cost of production and low feasibility .
Thus , popularizing solar cars requires lowering the price and enlarging the capacity of solar battery .
Actually , it is not easy to lower the price of solar cars since currently the materials used to make solar cars are high-tech aero-materials which are quite expensive .
Therefore , in order to lower the cost of production of solar cars , development of new materials is crucial .
Besides , the current development of solar battery is not good enough to afford long-distance driving .
Though newly developed solar battery can support hundreds of miles , it requires a rather critical weather extremely sunny days .
In conclusion , replacing traditional cars by solar cars can effectively control the deterioration of global warming , but further improvements are needed to widely popularize the use of solar cars .
"Air pollution is responsible for 310 ,000 premature deaths in Europe each year ."
("Air pollution causes early death ," 2005) To many people , they may not think much about air pollution because they could hardly feel the effects of it .
However results have proven otherwise .
Which is why , better air quality is one of human need that should be given priority .
Air pollution is the main reason why the world is suffering from bad air quality thus we should look at ways to cut down on air pollutants emission .
There are some current solutions available such as; primary regulations , control devices , increased fuel efficiency .
However , air pollution still persists .
Hence we should look at other alternatives like engineering design processes that might provide a solution .
Engineering design processes such as; improve on battery technology for automobiles , and design better control devices can be the solution .
Air pollution has led to health issues like respiratory diseases and premature deaths .
According to the Environmental Protection Agency (2008) , "on average , each of us breathes over 3 ,000 gallons of air each day ."
This means if the air is polluted , everyone will be affected .
These air pollutants are transmitted through air thus the toxic air pollutants produced from one country would affect its neighbouring countries as well .
Health issues caused by air pollution not only affect the individual but also to the world economy because those who are affected will not be able to work .

Besides improving on the current battery technology , designing better control devices will be another engineering solution for industrial purposes .
Emissions from power plants contribute to over 2 ,800 lung cancer deaths and 38 ,200 heart attacks annually in the US ("Deadly power plants ? ," 2004) .
Air pollutants from industrial sources made up to more than half of man-made emission .
Some of the current control devices available are scrubbers and nitrogen oxide control devices .
For scrubbers , there are external and system parameters that are affecting the efficiency .
Thus , it is not available to maximise its capabilities .
As for nitrogen oxide control devices , the cost of effective devices like the Selective Catalytic Reduction is extremely high .
Therefore , coming up with scrubbers and nitrogen oxide control devices that are more cost and control efficient will definitely reduce a significant amount of pollutants emission .
In conclusion , even though there are many solutions for air pollution available , the world is still suffering from bad air quality which leads to many health issues .
Engineering design processes are able to provide the world with effective solutions like better battery technology and control devices that will improve the air quality of the world .
With the air quality improved , the world will be able to lead a clean and healthier life .

Title: Two factors that hamper China's design process for innovation and their impacts correspondingly .
In the article The Generation of Innovations , Rogers (2003) stressed that the engineering design process for innovation including "problem recognition , research , development , commercialization , diffusion and consequences" .
For my home country , China , although its design process for innovation has been improved a lot , there still remain several factors which hamper the innovation process significantly .
Based on this idea , this essay will focus on two factors and explain their corresponding effects on certain design stages .
The first factor is the loopholes in the system of state-owned enterprises .
According to "Wikipedia" (2009 , para .1) , a state-owned enterprise defined as "a legal entity created by a government to undertake commercial activities on behalf of an owner government , and are usually considered to be an element or part of the state" .
Since the major interest of a state-owned enterprise is controlled by government , a state-owned enterprise can receive long-term economic and resource support from government .
Employees of state-owned enterprises don't have to worry the financial matter and are free from pressure .
In addition , the line between the functions of the government and enterprises is not clear .
Due to the political interference in stated-owned enterprises , state-owned enterprises and other type of enterprises do not compete against each other on an equal basis .
With regard to the first factor above , there emerge two impacts .
Firstly , the directors and manager of the state-owned enterprises exploit their position and power in the company to advance their own private interests .
The phenomenon of corruption is very common as well .
Thus , the money which goes into operation is reduced largely .
Furthermore , the motivations for most employees working in state-owned enterprises are pursuing the impressive salary and welfare .
As a consequence , most of the managers and employees have no sense of professional dedication and responsibility .
They are lazy and not interested in discovering .
Even if employees encounter some precious ideas by chance , they may not want to put effort into doing research and converting the ideas into production .
Thus , the above two impacts will affect the design stage , development stage significantly .
Since stated-owned enterprises play important roles in controlling and leading other type of enterprises in China , this will hamper China's design process for innovation from macroscopic view .
Apart from the loopholes in the system of state-owned enterprises , economic shortage of China's private companies also hampers the innovation process .
Unlike state-owned enterprises , private companies have no steady economic support .
They have to prepare for competition and the possibilities of bankrupt .
Most of the private companies may also lack funding , equipment and materials for operation and production .
With regard to the second factor , another two impacts should be considered as well .
One is the undesirable production .
According to Rogers (2003) , technology requires software and hardware components .
Since most high quality and accurate equipment is very expensive , some private companies could not afford it .
The poor equipment in private companies may lead to large uncertainty in design stage .
This could further lead to undesirable productions .
In addition , due to the economic shortage , private companies may not be able to hire people with high-educated knowledge and rich experience .
Hence , the design stage , machining stage and commercialization will be affected .
In short , there are many factors that may hamper China's design process for innovation .
Among them , the loopholes in the system of state-owned enterprises and the economic shortage of private companies are the two main causes .
If the two factors from two types of enterprises can be improved , the whole design process for innovation in China can be enhanced significantly .
It is widely believed that there is not any strong connection between technology innovations and examinations which is based on MCQs .
However , it still does .
While students can choose either by reasoning or by luck to complete their exams , the same thing is surprisingly can also be applied in technology .
Some technologies can be created via scientific research whereas some are accidentally developed .
Comparing two typical examples of innovations of two kinds , penicillin and vaccine discovery , we will notice some similarities as well as differences in terms of three main fields: progress of research , financial inputs and overall impact .
Last but not least , it would be mistaken without mentioning the importance of two kinds of research on our society .
Both vaccine and penicillin can be considered a huge success because it provides better preparation for diseases .
However , their impacts on the whole society are still different in that: While vaccine discovery was initially carried to resolve a problem recognized before , the success of penicillin discovery is beyond our expectation .
In 2005 , Hisense Company solved the Core Technology problem which used to worry the color TV industry of China .
Now China as the first TV production country can produce 75 million color TVs with homemade chips .
(Hisense Achieves Significant Breakthrough for Core Technology through Independent Innovation , 2005)In order to praise Hisense Group's significant achievement and encourage more innovation in China industry , the chairman of Hisense Company was chosen as the economic figure of the year 2005 .
However , many companies in China are still puzzled with lack of innovative product and many enterprisers are looking forward revolutionary innovation to come .
This paper will point out two main problems which hamper engineering design process for innovation and state their respective impact on certain stages of the process .
Another problem hampering engineering design process is that proprietary intellectual property is not highly valued in China .
People can illegally download songs , software and games from websites without payment .
The inventors of the decoded product fail to gain benefit that they should get .
Since their Intellectual Property Rights are not protected , people are discouraged to put in effort in the engineering design process .
This problem also hampers engineering design process at the beginning since people are discouraged to enter this process .
Recently , the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China announced that Intellectual Property Rights are the power of the development of enterprises .
(Cabinet Approves Intellectual Property Rights Guidelines , 2008)The related regulation and law were also issued and implemented to ensure the rights of inventors are reserved .
The government believes that this will improve the engineering design process for innovation in the near future .
Nuclear technology refers to technology that "involves the reaction of atomic nuclei" (Wikipedia , n .d .) .
It may appear as a high-tech term but in fact it has been put into use in various areas: radiometric dating , food irradiation , x-ray and chemotherapy in medicine and so on .
Yet , as a powerful technology , many applications of this technology have been limited due to political , environmental and economical factors .
Like many other technologies , nuclear technology first came into use to meet military demands .
Since nuclear weapons are of mass destruction , policymakers of countries all over the world prohibit research of nuclear technology's application in military aspect and a non-proliferation treaty has been open for signature since 1968 (International Atomic Energy Agency , 1970) .
However , this act also hinders the investigation of nuclear technology since it restricts the enrichment of uranium .
American president Obama once said that highly enriched uranium around the world worried him most (Lafayette , 2008) .
Due to nuclear technology's special application in military aspect and the complex international situation , it may be difficult for some countries to master nuclear technology and this characteristic is described as proliferation resistance (International Atomic Energy Agency , 2004) .

To sum up , nuclear technology is greatly influenced by political , environmental and economical factors .
Nuclear technology's special function in military usage makes international cooperation in this technology extremely difficult; the radioactive character of this technology causes a lot of environmental issues and its cost in some applications is still high .
However , with increasing industrial demands , oil reserves are at depressed levels; so it's highly likely that we will have to seek solution in nuclear technology in the near future .

In an era which the scale of our industrial system is growing larger and larger , the consumption of resource becomes an incredible burden on the environment and people start to suffer the aftermath for the destruction and pollution we have done to the environment , a series of social issues concerning engineering and environment have been raised .
Among them , the paradox between the decreasing natural resource deposits and people's increasing energy consumption may be given a high priority .
Upon that , according to Khandani (2005) , engineering design of products and systems may provide us a way to solve the problem .
In this essay , how does engineering design processes cope with the energy crisis will be discussed in terms of gathering pertinent information and analysis and selection of an optimized solution .
Besides gathering information , doing a wise selection among all the options is yet another must-do in engineering design process .
Selecting the best solution will minimize the energy consumption and cut down the cost for producing the product or sustaining the system .
When going through this process , various factors will be considered such as function , ergonomics and liability and so on (Khandani , 2005) .
Therefore , the selected proposal can hopefully be expected to be environmentally friendly , less energy consuming and safe of using at the same time .
In a sentence , when dealing with energy crisis , doing analysis and selecting the best solution is of great importance .
Simply by scanning at the item you buy , the cashier can tell the price of the item .
This shows the power of bar code .
Bar code , being familiar as black lines with numbers , is a "method of automatic identification and data collection" (Bellis , n .d . , para 1) .
The first patent of bar code was created in 1952 by Bernard Silver and Norman Joseph Woodland (Seideman , n .d .) .
Through decades of development , bar code has been shaped by social factors to some extent .
The users , especially retailers and product manufacturers , play important roles in improving bar code .
Specifically , the demands of users , the economic concerns of users and the wide range of users are significant factors that shape the invention .
In addition to the demands and economic concerns , the wide range of users helps to improve bar code .
It promotes bar code to be developed into an internationally recognized and commonly readable system .
It is clear that globalization is inevitable which means bar code has to adjust itself to meet globalization .
Apparently , a standard system is needed otherwise it will be difficult to trade .
Bar code has been standardised since 1970s and it is being improved accordingly (Seideman , n .d .) .
Besides globalization , the various kinds of users shape it to an easily implemented technology .
This guarantees that most users are able to master use of devices quickly .
To sum up , bar code is an important technology .
Because of users' demands , financial capability of users and wide range of users , bar code is shaped to an innovation which is globally recognized and essential to the world .
Singapore is a small country , with a small population .
Here , we face problems of shortage of natural resources as well as lack of funding , when it comes to designing for our innovations .
These could greatly affect the engineering process for designing for our innovations .
The shortage of natural resources mean that all raw materials required for engineering design process for innovations would have to come from import .
This by itself poses problems such as greater cost incurred for innovations , shipment fees , as well as a delay in engineering design process .
The higher cost makes it expensive for engineering designing processes hence groups that do not have funding or sufficient funding will be held back .
This is because the designing process usually involves a lot of trial and error , using various materials for different parts of the innovation , in order to optimize the best working condition for the item of innovation .
The delay in shipment of raw materials causes a lapse of time before the materials can reach Singapore .
This results in a delay of the testing of the engineering design which slows down the whole engineering design process .
Professor Seah (2009) mentioned that the Formula Society of Automotive Engineers (FSAE) their first formula race car took 2 years instead of 1 to be produced , partly because of a lack of raw materials and funding .
The long shipping time and greater cost due to importing of raw materials delayed the engineering design process as they only have a plan of the race car but no chance to physically fabricate the parts and build the car , while the raw materials are still on their way to Singapore Another problem which could greatly affect the engineering process for designing is a lack of funding .
The designing process requires a large amount of raw materials for repeated fabrications of each part with different material in order to obtain the most suitable material to optimize the function of the product of innovation .
Even for the same kind of material , it might have to be used several times as the parts fabricated is not necessarily always in the expected condition when it is first made , resulting in a wastage and hence greater consumption of raw materials and therefore a greater cost incurred in the designing process .
Without funding , this step of designing would be impossible especially if the raw materials are required in large quantity .
Innovations which require expensive raw materials will be impossible to proceed if there is insufficient funding .
One innovation which went on very well in Singapore as a result of funding is the desalination of sea water .
Water supply has always been a key issue for consideration by Singapore government .
Singapore has been very reliant on neighboring countries such as Malaysia in supplying us with water .
This dependence on neighboring countries for water creates a need for Singapore to become more self-reliant on water supply .
Hence when idea of water desalination first came out , it was greatly funded by Singapore government for further improvements in Singapore .
Water-technology .net claims that tuas desalination plants produces water at 110000 cubic meters , enough to meet 10% of Singapore's daily water needs(At 110 ,000m3/day , n .d .) .
Therefore , availability of funding plays a great role in affecting the engineering process of designing .
With funding , there can be further research and development into improving the innovation even after it is created .
In conclusion , the engineering process for designing for innovations is greatly dependent on the availability of raw materials and funding .
The delay or shortage in either of them will lead to a lapse or even stoppage of the designing process .
Reference
At 110 ,000m3/day , the Tuas seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) plant has sufficient capacity to meet around 10% of the national demand - and at a price which challenges the notion that desalination is a high-cost option .

Innovations may be affected either by social determinism or technology determinism .
The UK Technology Education Centre states that "Social determinism refers to the hypothesis that social interactions and constructs alone determine individual behaviour (as opposed to biological or objective factors)" .
Nationmasters .com states "technology determinism is a theory which points to technology as being the force which shapes society ."
Social determinisms affect demands of products and thus the revenue and profit .
Toshiba laptop is largely affected by social determinists .
Its success is determined mainly by three factors: company's perception towards the product , economic factor and social factor .
Besides the company's perceptions , economic factor also play an important role .
Resources and funding are required in an innovation to help improve it .
One is not able to come out with successful innovations by dreaming of their achievements .
Coming out with new products requires support .
For Toshiba , the profits earned from the sales of the laptops were further invested to improve the quality of the later-produced laptops .
If a product has no financial support , it will not be successful as it not able to keep up with the challenges of the newly developed technology .
The most important factor that contributes to any innovation is the response of the public .
Consumers are important groups of people who will determine the success of the product .
At that time , the offices were cramped and there were no space available for workers to place their desktop .
The newly invented laptops were able to overcome these problems because of their small size and the ability to be carried around conveniently .
This convenience increases efficiency of workers as they are now able to work from anywhere in their offices besides their desk area .
As mentioned in the Rogers (2003) article , "By 1988 , Toshiba commanded a 38 percent market share for laptops in Europe and 21 percent in the United States; a year later , it commanded 46 percent market share in Japan , despite the quick reactions of its competitors ."
More technology savvy people demand for laptop and thus the company constantly innovated and improved in order to bring the invention to greater heights .
The Toshiba laptop was successful because of economic , social and the change in the company's perceptions of the product .
It is not possible to succeed with only one factor .
Therefore Toshiba needs to consider all factors during their innovations .
There were a lot of discoveries in history which resulted in the various products and technologies we use today .
Most of these discoveries are made due to normal research .
But there still existed a lot of discoveries that were made as a result of serendipitous result of normal research which always had some interesting stories behind them .
Although these two types of discoveries could both influence the society , there are two interesting differences between them in designing process .
(Rogers , 2003)
Living in a small country like Singapore has various limitations and thus more challenging for her to compete with larger nations .
Several of these limitations significantly affect the design process of new innovations .
A majority of these limitations would increases the cost of the innovation and hence require careful design .
One of these problems includes the city-state's lack of land space which would affect the structural design of the innovation particularly if it was on the large scale .
Another would be Singapore's dense population that affects the location and structural considerations of the design process .
Singapore currently has a land space 683 square kilometers , a country barely visible on the map .
A strategy adopted by the government to solve this problem is land reclamation , which currently accounts for about 10% of its land space .
To further maximize land space , Singapore's structures are mainly skyscrapers with strong and often costly foundations .
This issue particularly affects innovations that are on the larger scale , as large cost will be incurred in the construction of its foundations .
This increase in cost will hence hinder the market value and affect the economic analysis stage of the design process .
Take for example the housing in Singapore , which comprises mainly of Housing Development Board [HDB] flats .
In view of the collapse of Nicoll highway back in April 2004 , HDB has put up very strict requirements on the piling process and the materials used , like grade 30 concrete should be used in piling .
Similarly , the steel structure that forms the backbone of the buildings , require a minimum of 3mm steel gauge at least .
All these may drive up cost and hence affect the design process .
Aside from the problem of the lack of land space , there is also the consideration of its extremely dense population .
Contradictory to its limited land area as discussed earlier , it houses more than 4 million people .
During the peak hours , crowded trains and bus stations will be hard to miss .
New innovations thus have to consider its design rather seriously given the circumstances .
All these will seriously affect the functionality analysis stage of the design process , as more time and consideration will have to be channeled into this portion .
One example of a properly located and well-designed amenity would be the Mass Rail transit [MRT] stations .
Some stations are made connected to shopping malls while others to bus interchanges , thereby making transport in Singapore relatively convenient .
In addition to that , some of these stations like City Hall and Dhoby Ghaut station , not only play the role of an important hub in Singapore's transport system , but also an internal shopping center within itself .
City- link , which is connected to city hall station , is an underground network of shops that link itself to other larger shopping facilities .
Such an example shows how proper planning of the amenities lead to the success of the application .
In conclusion , being a small country , Singapore has several issues that may affect the design process of future innovations , particularly its limited land space and its extremely dense population .
Certain examples like the MRT and the HDB flats are evidence that even with limited resources , Singapore can still flourish .
With proper design and careful planning , perhaps these limitations would be a thing of the past .

In most people's opinion technology can only developed or created via research .
Such as the invention of new explosive , in order to find new explosive Nobel spent nearly all his time doing experiments in his library .
But there are still some technology is invented from a serendipitous discovery .
Such as guncotton , it is invented by Schoenbein by chance .
Difference between these two inventions is the ideas about how to invent them come out in different ways .
As we all know Nobel is a very hardworking and brave man .
He nearly used all his time to work for new explosive and his younger brother dead in a failing experiment at the same time his brother's death had an unbalancing affection on his father .
His father dead right after his younger brother (Nils .
R , N .d) .
But he never gave up and risked his life to go on his invention and his ideas came from his effort .
The story about how Schoenbein invented guncotton was quite an interesting story .
According to Yang(2007) , " when Schoenbein is doing experiments he overthrew a bottle of chemical solution , and the solution flowed on the table Schoenbein found nothing but his wife's apron to clean the table .
After he finished cleaning he thought that his wife will blame him after she saw what he had done .
So he wanted to use the stove to dry the apron .
When he walked near the stove the apron burned without any smoke and ashes left .
Then he felt very happy because he realized that he had found a new kind of explosive ."
Nobel can invent the explosive successfully because of his diligence and the attitude towards science which made him never give up .
Schoenbein came up with his idea accidentally and finally made an great invention for the word .
There are also some similarities between these two technologies .
First of all they are both invented by prudential chemists .
If Noble is not a prudential person and do not do his experiments and observe the phenomenon seriously though he is hardworking he may never invent the new explosive successfully .
From the story of how Schoenbein came up with the idea about the guncotton we can tell that he is really a lucky scientist .
But without the prudential attitude towards science he may miss his good luck and did not go on finding how can this phenomenon occur .
Secondly these two technologies both made great contribute to the industry and military affairs .
As both of them are explosive , people use them to exploit mines , tear down great buildings and provide a high temperature for many chemical experiments .
They are also widely used in battlefield .
Engineer use them to make all kinds of weapons .
Technology no matter it was developed via research or resulted from a serendipitous was scientist's greatest contribution to the word .
The 'Made in China' phenomenon has signaled China's endeavor to catch up with the advanced western countries .
However , the unprecedentedly rapid economic growth , driven by manufacturing and export industry , probably prevent people from discovering the problems that may impede engineering design process for innovation .
Two of these problems involve the special political environment and Chinese people's mindset , which already have negative influence on several stages of engineering design process for innovation in China .
Another problem refers to Chinese people's mindset .
As Michael Keane (2007) has noted , the common assumption existing long among the Chinese was that productivity directly equals to material production .
"In other word , a focus on production and performance indicators in China had impacted negatively on innovation" .
Therefore , even today in China , it is still reasonable to argue that the process for innovation may not be well understood , which means , in the respective of knowledge degree of technology transfer , the innovation-development does not seem capable to function well .
Moreover , according to what E . M . Rogers (2003) stated in 'The Generation of Innovation' , in the face of high degree of uncertainty , these social factors in innovation-development process determine what technology is actually available to the consumers .
To sum up , we are all witnessing the state's transformation from 'Made in China' to 'Created in China' .
In current stage , political environment and people's mindset are two of the problems that may hamper engineering design process for innovation .
Furthermore , these problems already have impact on several stages of the process .

Rogers' first stage is needs or problems , which indicates the initial target or request of the whole research and development process .
It is quite interesting that the initial researching target of the two products is the same: to create a more powerful and adhesive glue .
However , it turns out later that the serendipitous discovery actually has no real target in this stage , because the real use of post-it note seems totally different from what it has been expected at the beginning .
The next stage research is to use the scientific method to fulfill the previous target .
So we can find that the super glue's inventor successfully find what he needs while the post-it notes' inventor create a strange glue that is low adhesive but re-adherable .
In this stage , the difference between the two kinds of discoveries turns to be that the serendipitous discovery's inventor could not meet his initial needs like the normal inventor but accidently create a totally different product instead .
So we can conclude that , the serendipitous discovery and the normal one differ only in the first two stages of Rogers' innovation process .
And from the third stage onward , they seem to have no more obvious differences .
In the context of the innovation-development process , the development of technologies may be viewed from either a technologically determinist perspective or a socially determinist view , also referred to as the social construction of technology (Rogers , 2003) .
Identify one important technology which was socially determined or shaped by a specific group of users and discuss how specific factors (e .g . , economic factors , military demands , or government regulations/priorities) have shaped this technological innovation .
What is technology ?
According to Roger (2003) , technology is a design for instrumental action that reduces the uncertainty in the cause-effect relationships involved in achieving a desired outcome .
In the context of innovation-development process , the development of technologies may be viewed from either a technologically determinist perspective or a socially determinist view .
Technological determinism means the belief of a technology causes changes in society (Rogers , 2003) , while social determinism argues that technology is constructed by social factors .
One important technology which was shaped by a specific group of users is electric vehicles , which had been shaped by four different factors that are technical , economic factors , social , and political changes .
Technical factor is one of the four elements that determine the development of electric vehicle .
Compared to the structure of a conventional automobile , electric vehicle has a similar structure but different components .
Electric vehicle has a lighter weight as most of its parts are made up of aluminium .
In addition , electric vehicle is safe to drive around as it is solely using electricity , while most conventional vehicles require gasoline , which is inflammable .
On the other hand , electric vehicle utilizes electrical energy by using batteries , so the engine is relatively clean , emission-free and quiet .
However , there are less charging stations and electric vehicle requires a long recharge time .
Therefore , it has limited usage and driving range .
Economically , technology for electric vehicles had not widely met the need because less promotion was held and there was a mass production of gasoline type automobiles .
Fewer promotions on electric vehicles were organized and auto shows were not often organized , resulting in relatively discouraging sales .
Furthermore , electric vehicles were not advertised in precise manners .
Besides , declined cost in oil in the past encouraged people to buy gasoline cars .
At this point , there was a mass production of gasoline cars .
Insurance and financing were included in purchasing these vehicles .
In the end , gasoline vehicles controlled the monopoly on automobiles in market .
From these examples , we can see that various economic factors had a great influence on electric vehicles .
Compared to conventional vehicles that are available now , electric vehicles are socially determined in several reasons: limited range of electric vehicles , beliefs and values of the society today .
Because of limited choices of electric cars , people choose conventional automobiles which offer greater variety of choices .
Despite several advantages , their interests towards electric cars are fading .
Additionally , some have negative beliefs and values towards electric cars .
They believe that their status may be lowered by purchasing the cars .
They also feel that these cars are less attractive compared to conventional cars too .
In addition , political factors can affect how the sales of vehicles go , which include government's adherence to this technology .
People lose interests as government is not supportive .
Not only that government provides subsidies and incentives to users , who use gasoline cars , but also constructs and designs roads for conventional vehicles .
All in all , we can easily see that from these examples , many factors that specified by other group of users have led electric vehicles to a decline .
According to Sovacool (2009) , acceptance of a new technology depends not only on technical factors but also economic , political , and social ones .
These specific factors need to be analyzed to work out a better solution algorithmically and tackle the existing problems .

Recent data indicates that well-known Xiaonei .com to be the largest social networking site in China , open to the public , mainly university students .
According to Global Times , renren .com , the present name of Xiaonei .com , has attracted 70 million registered users since it was founded in 2005(Lin , 2009) .
Charging free , Xiaonei .com stands out with 63 .4% share of the social networking site market (Wang , 2008) .
No one can deny that Xiaonei .com is now a big success , leading in its field .
In my humble opinion , its success is owing to both social and economic factors .
On the social part , Xiaonei .com builds its success on the true networking environment it provides , well-rounded functions and convenience in looking for friends and classmates .
To begin with , Xiaonei .com requires the university email addresses and confirmation via this address when an application to sign up is being processed .
This action ensures the true identity of the users .
As mentioned before , undergraduate is predominant among groups of users .
Undergraduate students may probably feel secured , and thus free to share diaries , pictures and updates with friends , which may not be the case in other sites in the virtue Internet world .
Furthermore , Xiaonei .com incorporates all kinds of functions such as the instant communication of MSN , online games and other applications like daily forecast of fortune .
With Xiaonei .com there is no need to click on respective web links and to wait for a while before the wanted functions are ready .
Instead , what should be done is simply logging in Xiaonei .com and then almost all the expected functions are available .
Last but not least , users save time in looking for their friends and simply get things done in a second as long as the information on the school and class is obtained .
To sum up , social factors and economic factors work hand in hand with each other to push Xiaonei .com where it is now .
True identity of user of Xiaonei .com is indefinitely the outstanding social factor , which matches university students' expectation to share their true life in a secure way .
Meanwhile , investment drawn from reputation is the key economic drive for Xiaonei .com to develop .
As a perfect combination of social and economic factors , Xiaonei .com has come so far and there is still a long way to go to prevail globally .
All modern jet aircraft are powered by engines based on the first jet engine .
This was first developed by Frank Whittle in 1937 and installed in military aircrafts during the World War II .
After the war , this technology was transferred to commercial use and enabled faster and safer air travel .
In the context of the social construction of technology , I will discuss how various social factors have shaped this technological innovation .
Military priority during the World War II was an important factor in propelling the design and use of jet engine .
Frank Whittle , the inventor of jet propulsion , was a pilot in the Royal Air Force in the early 1920s .
When he first proposed the idea of turbo jet propulsion , it was met with skepticism by the Air Ministry and was denied assistance and funding from the country ("Biography: Sir Frank Whittle ," n .d .) .
Frank Whittle then continued to work on his engine but due to lack of funding , he made little progress .
Finally just a few months before the invasion of Poland by Germany and in the wake of possible threats , the Air ministry finally took Frank's work seriously and promised funding in Frank's research (Younossi et al . ,2003) .
As we can see , if there is no threat of war , the British Government may not provide any funding at all .
The jet engine will not be invented at all as people then do not see the need for plane to travel so fast .

The social setting of the invention also plays an interesting role in shaping the history of jet engine .
When Frank Whittle carried out his research for the British , a German physicist by the name of Hans Von Ohain had already successfully invented the jet engine and the first test flight was a whole two years earlier than Frank Whittle's (McTavish , 1993) .
However Frank's model was more recognized than Han's due to two reasons .
First , the first jet flight was unknown to the world due to military secrecy under the Nazi regime (Crandall , 2007) .
Second , the war ended with the Allies emerging victorious .
Therefore , Hans's engine was not developed while the U .K continued to improve on Frank Whittle's design , which would later be evolved to commercial uses .
In this case , the engine used was socially determined by the winning party of the war .
Two feasible engines had meet up with different fate due to the different social settings .
Last by not least , the increase in the trends of international tourism is the one factor that allows jet engines to be converted to civilian usage today .
After the war , peace returned and economy prospered due to reconstruction efforts .
People became more affluent and demand for foreign travel increased exponentially (Lyth , 1975) .
Planes in use then were slow; around 250 miles per hour  , and the airlines industry needed a better alternative .
This was when the jet engines were developed to fit into the commercial planes we travel on today .
As we can see , a change in society trend can completely revolutionize the usage of a technology .
This is a striking example of how social factors shaped the way people use a technology .
To conclude , the jet engine has come a long way .
From its initial usage in killing machines to its function in revolutionizing air travel , the jet engine in use today has been shaped by many social considerations and I certainly believe it will continue to be so in the many futures to come .

Since the reform and open policy was established in 1978 , China has enjoyed a booming development in economics and technology .
A large amount of foreign capitals as well as advanced foreign technologies have been introduced to China .
As a result , a lot of factories are built to provide the whole world with cheap and qualified products .
However , the technological innovation for engineering design is still a weak point for Chinese manufactories .
Many Chinese enterprises do not have their own technology and the technological innovation is mainly relied on the introduced foreign technology .
What exactly hamper the engineering design innovations in China ?
In my opinion , a serious plagiarism problem of Chinese institutes and the conservative consumption concept of Chinese people are two significant restrictions for the innovation of engineering design in China .
The plagiarism problem in both researching process and manufacturing process of engineering design is very serious in China .
In Chinese universities and other research organizations , plagiarism is rampant .
A Chinese study shows that "60 percent of PhD candidates admitted to plagiarism , bribery" (Marquand , 2006) .
University professors are also exposed of plagiarism .
For instance , Wang Mingming , a sociology professor in Peking University plagiarized 100 .000 words from an American anthropologist's work in the year 2002(Academic Circles , 2002) .
Plagiarism also exists in manufactories .
A notable number of Chinese factories make piratical products by copying foreign products .
For example , Meizu , a Chinese electrical manufactory famous for its pseudo "Apple inspired design" music players recently comes up with a new product M8 .
This new product is actually another copycat of Apple iphone (Ricker , 2007) .
Another example is the popular Chinese website " Xiaonei" .
It is exactly a fake "Facebook" .
Plagiarism can have strong negative effects on the innovation of engineering design .
By plagiarizing , engineers are not inclined to generate and analyze multiple solutions (Khandani , 2005) .
They tend to copy other engineers' work and become less creative , which in turn , significantly hamper the engineering design innovation of the whole nation .

The world is becoming more competitive .
Only creative countries with innovative engineers can lead the technology of the world .
Therefore , innovation in engineering design is of extreme importance .
China has to be aware of its problems in engineering design in order to be a leading nation in the 21st century .
By reducing the plagiarism rate of Chinese institutes and gradually converting the conservative consumption concept of Chinese people , China can really make a big difference .

Food shortage is much more serious than it used to be now .
According to an article published on the Internet , the impact of food crisis is historically spreading from developing world to developed world (Kate Smith and Rob Edwards , 2009) .
It is the critical time to make some substantial changes to solve this essential challenge .
Appropriate facilities , efficient technology support and proper use of food are required to increase the food production in order to solve the food shortage problem .
First and foremost , government should improve the facilities in the current agriculture system to satisfy the fundamental requirements .
To be more accurate , in the developing countries , government should make a good plan to build irrigation canal and bank based on the analysis of local climate and geography .
Government should provide stable surroundings for farmers to plant food .
Protecting plant away from droughts and floods is necessary to have a good harvest .
Besides the infrastructure construction , another advisable method to increase production is to mechanize the agriculture system .
Armed with machine , farmers can make the most of limited farmland and time .
Having made a good plan to help farmers to produce more food , government must use the food properly .
Otherwise , no matter how much food can be harvested , many people will still suffer starvation .
From the same article which was mentioned in the first paragraph , a surprising fact emerges from the sophisticated Internet .
"Last year a quarter of the US maize crop was turned into ethanol to fuel vehicles - and the US supplies more than 60% of the world's maize exports .
"(Kate Smith and Rob Edwards , 2009) .
It sounds very ridiculous that while 102 .1 million people received food from UN WFP (WFP in numbers , 2009) because they did not have enough food , an appreciable percentage of food was used to run cars .
It can never be called progress but ignorance .
It is an inhuman action to turn food into ethanol to feed cars instead of helping those starving people .
Government should not abuse food .
In conclusion , there are three advisable ways to solve the food shortage .
Infrastructure is the foundation of agriculture .
Upgrading the infrastructure is necessary for food production to increase .
Apart from infrastructure , high-tech technology also can do a big favor in this issue .
Last but not least , proper use of food must be highlighted .
Through these methods , a better situation will come soon .
During the last decade , Vietnam experienced significant changes .
In 1986 , the government of Vietnam introduced the "Doi moi" - reforming program to bring about improvements in the living of its people .
Although progress has been impressive by almost any standards: economy , education , health service . . . , Vietnam must face a lot of current challenges , especially in technology .
Among these challenges , the shortages of investment and skilled workers actually hamper engineering design processes for innovation .
At present , the lack of investment makes several projects in Vietnam progress tardily or incompletely .
Standard of living has become higher and higher .
As a result , the needs of energy , effective machine , modern communication service . . . ask for an innovation in engineering design processes that " often begins with recognition of a problem or need" (Rogers , 2003 , p . 136) .
Vietnamese engineers have knowledge and enthusiasm to start research and development .
However , at this stage , they must face a serious question: "Where do the investments come from ?"
Without money , engineers can't continue and improve their ideas .
In fact , most of those researches have only existed in paper and laboratories .
For instance , despite the assessment of substantial potential energy , wind energy in Vietnam is not developed and is only applied in researching phase .
According to Do (2008) , around 28 ,000 square kilometers of the country's land had an average wind speed of over seven meters per second (para .
2) .
The wind energy project requires a great investment that is too high for provinces; so , they are trying to attract foreign and private investors .
But there are still difficulties for foreigners and organizations seeking to invest in Vietnam .
One of these involves the form of pricing .
Do showed "State- owned monopoly power distributor Vietnam Electricity ( EVN) only pays 4 .5 cents for a kilowatt hour (kWh) of wind energy though the cost of generating it is not less than six cents ."
Thus , the Vietnamese laws would better be changed to reflect the needs of investors .
In addition to the investment , the force of skilled workers is also a difficult problem for Vietnam .
The condition of shortage of skilled workers has appeared for a long time , but recently , in speeding up production process , this condition becomes urgent .
In Binh Duong , a province of Vietnam , the real situation is "roughly 50 ,000 labors were needed to fill positions each year" ("Firms grapple with shortage" , 2009) .
So the engineering design process is short of efficient workers joining in the commercialization of an innovation .
However , in many training schools , there is still lack of facilities and equipment that can't help workers improve their practical skill .
Therefore , from now , Vietnamese government should find a solution to link factories and companies with schools in training workers .
With the investment from them , the school has abilities to modernize facilities so that training condition will be better .
The shortage of investment and skilled workers is a problem needing solutions rapidly as well as lastingly .
Undergoing this challenge , Vietnam will gain more power to catch up with the developed world .
Engineering design processes for innovations are very important to the industry of China .
However , some existing problems hamper the innovations .
Here , a make an example .
With the rapid development of the oil industry , the process and conveyance of oil is more and more advanced .
Just at this time , a new kind of material comes into being which is called new plastic material .
Compared with traditional metal conduit , plastic conduit has the advantages of lighter in weight , stronger ability to bear corrosion and smaller resistance .
In addition , plastic conduit saves sources , costs less and is easily fixed .
As a result , plastic conduit is very popular from engineers .
However , nowadays , there are some problems hamper the engineering design processes for innovations in China .
Two significant problems are about the raw material and the utilization .
In the board sweep of scientific history , scientists have made a lot of discoveries via research .
In contrast , a lot of serendipitous discoveries were made at the same time .
As a serendipitous discovery , the discovery of penicillin is very different from the discovery of the DNA's structure , because Alexander Fleming started to study penicillin by an accidental finding , but Watson and Crick started the research on the DNA's structure based on Franklin's previous study .
Furthermore , Fleming did not experience failure during the study on penicillin , but the discovery of DNA's structure did not seem to be that smooth .
The discovery of penicillin was started accidentally , but Watson and Crick started their research on the structure of DNA based on the previous research done by Franklin .
Douglas Allchin (n .d .) once put in his article saying that "Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin is one of the most celebrated cases of chance , or accident , in science (Allchin , n .d .) ."
Although Louis Pasteur once said that "chance favors only the prepared mind" , it was fortune that have done the most job to make Fleming the person who found penicillin .
Well , for Watson and Crick , it was another story .
"These two brash young scientists" ("The discovery of" , n .d .) spent more than one year discussing the result of Franklin's research and their assumptions before they really embarked on their own research .
Maybe it was just because that Fleming discovered the penicillin by chance , he did not experience any failure during the discovering process , while the discovery of the DNA's structure did not seem to be that easy and the process did not seem to be smooth , either .
After "Fleming noticed a halo of inhibition of bacterial growth around a contaminant blue-green mould on a Staphylococcus plate culture" ("Discovery of penicillin" , 2009) , he started his research and discovered penicillin .
Everything seems progressing normally .
When it comes to the DNA's structure , the situation was quite different .
In the 1950s , not only Watson and Crick , but also two other groups were working on the research wanting to determine the structure of DNA , but in the end , only Watson and Crick were able to produce good quality diffraction patterns and thus produce sufficient quantitative data about the structure ("History of molecular" , 2009) .
In conclusion , scientists made new discoveries by using different methods .
The discovering process of penicillin and the structure of DNA were totally different , but the scientists have made significant contribution to human beings by making both discoveries .
Furthermore , both of them are still playing an important role in the medical field in 21st century .

Over the years , man has come up with many marvelous ideas and technologies which helped to simplify our lives by a huge leap .
These great ideas were thanks to the hardwork and effort that researchers put in to make them happen .
However , some of the unthinkable ideas were not created through research .
These creations are called serendipitous discoveries .
Often than not , they are chanced upon when the researchers are researching on something else instead .
Let us take a closer look at two examples , the electric car as technology that was developed via research and warfarin which was a result of a serendipitous discovery , and find out what are some of their similarities and differences in terms of their popularity , usefulness , production cost , and other usages .
Both the electric car and warfarin gained in popularity from the moment they were developed .
The electric cars were heavily marketed when the prototype became available .
Advertisements were put up in each local newspaper , inviting interested individuals to apply for an opportunity to test-drive the new vehicle .
The response turned out to be overwhelming .
According to Rogers E .M .(2003) , in Sacramento , with a population of close to half a million , seven thousand applied .
And though they were given thrity minutes after the test-drive to ask questions , they find that it was not enough to ask all the questions that they have in mind .
Also , when asked to hand out wallet-sized cards containing information on the electric cars , the test-drivers did it with passion .
They even asked for more cards when they finished giving out what they have .
As for warfarin , it was a big hit too as it was a very effective antidote against pests like rats and mice .
However , to this date , it has been overtaken by another stronger poison called brodifacoum .
This is because many rat populations have developed resistance to warfarin .
Therefore , a poison of greater potency is needed .
Another similarity between the two different innovations is that they are both useful in their own way .
The electric car is created as it does not pollute the air unlike gasoline vehicles .
The electric car is also lightweight and very quiet , which does not produce noise pollution as well .
Therefore , the electric car serves its purpose of being a clean and pollution-free car .
The warfarin is useful as rats causes a lot of problems especially to farmers , and warfarin is very effective against them .
Besides , it is not dangerous to humans who might happen to consume it .
Thus , both creations are very useful in the role they play in making our life a better one .
One difference between the two innovations is the production cost of each product .
The electric car is a large scale project where large amount of money is pumped into doing research in order to improve the car .
Besides that , each individual part that make up the car is also expensive .
As compared to the electric car , warfarin is a cheap product which is easily available in the market .
Another consideration that separates the electric car from warfarin is that the electric car only has one usage whereas warfarin has other usages besides being used as a pesticide .
The electric car is a vehicle used for transportation and that is its sole purpose .
Warfarin , on the other hand , can be used as an anticoagulant .
It is prescribed to people with an increased tendency for thrombosis , the formation of blood clot inside the blood vessel .
Warfarin can also help to prevent formation of future blood clots .
In conclusion , although technology can be created by means of doing research or by chance , there are still some similarities and differences between them .
Right from the first Industrial Revolution , human's daily life is being enriched by exploding number of inventions .
Currently human beings require more varies and amount of inventions .
Some of the inventions are developed from the conventional generated technology while others may come from innovations which are created in a skunkworks environment .
Both of the two methods require tough jobs and their researchers must overcome the impacts of unpredictable market during the process .
On the surface , conventionally generated technology and innovation created in a skunkworks environment do not differ .
One similarity the two technologies share is that the process is tough .
Because of market demands , researchers have to work overloaded so as to come out the technology faster .
Besides , researchers have to repeat the same experiment hundreds of times until success .
For example , Edison decided to invent electric light after Ferrari invented electric motor .
After concluding previous experiences , Edison tried about 1600 different materials as filament with noting down each of their performances .
Besides , Edison also tried to vacuumize the lamp .
And finally all the efforts turned to be success that the first light in the world appeared in 1879 .
In addition , the two technology processes have another feature in common , that is researchers have to take all the uncertain consequences including a total failure during the process .
In other words , no matter the technology derives from a convention or it is definitely a new innovation , it has to be prepared for the worst outcome .
Sometimes the final product cannot reach what people have expected , or the new innovation cannot be accepted by public temporarily , then negative impacts may influence the continuing research .
Therefore , the two types of technologies are alike since tough jobs are required and researchers must be ready for any consequence given by the unpredicted market .
However , they also differ .
First of all , the length of the research process may differ .
As conventionally generated technology is always upgraded from a previous technology , in contrast , innovation is to come up with a total new technology which has fewer references .
Hence , developing a conventionally generated technology is always faster than coming up with an innovation .
Moreover , conventionally generated technology and innovation receive different attitudes from other people .
As conventionally generated technology obeys people's psychological inertia so that it can easily satisfy people .
In addition , the previous technology it is based on may have already gained reputations , hence the majority of people will support the R&D process and the process is always under observation .
But when it comes to innovation , the conditions are quite different .
The researchers of the innovation may receive poor feedbacks in the prior market research , or someone even regard the researchers as idiots .
Thus normally the innovation has to be developed in a skunkworks environment .
Take the birth of the first Toshiba laptop as an example , initially the idea of the laptop could not be accepted by the organizational hierarchy of Toshiba .
However the engineer Mizoguchi persisted to research the laptop in a skunkworks environment , and finally he got the triumph and nowadays laptop is becoming essential in our daily life .
To conclude , conventionally generated technology and innovation created in a skunkworks environment are alike , yet different .
Both of them require endless efforts although they may be neglected temporarily , but they should be appreciated since they contribute a lot to the development of technology .
In recently years , engineering design for innovation has aroused consideration from the public in China .
As a most important aspect to contribute to the development of science and technology of the nation as well as improve living standard of people , engineering design for innovations plays a significant role in the current Chinese society .
However , there are still many problems hampering engineering design process for innovations .
The exam-orientated education system and the undesirable climate in the academic circle are two of the most serious ones which affect engineers' motivation and capacities during the process .
The exam-orientated education system has existed in China for a long time .
It does have some advantages; however , it has more side effect on people's innovation and creation .
In the process of basic education , spoon-feeding education is the main teaching method in this system and it focuses on memorization .
Students are required to remember whatever books read and teaches teach without thinking about whether it is true or not .
Besides , high marks in exams are their goal of study .
They do a lot of exercise so as to be proficient at solving problems in the exam papers .
They gradually ignore thinking and doubting and lose the awareness and ability of creation and innovation .
In the phase of tertiary education in China , although students have more chance of self-study , most of them still focus on various kinds of exams in order to get certificates .
They pursue further study in purpose of getting a better job rather than do research .
Still , they achieve a master degree or PhD through exams .
In general , the exam-orientated education system has affected engineering design process of innovations .
In addition , the undesirable climate in the academic circle is hampering innovations even more seriously .
There are few engineers absorbed in creation and innovation .
Many are more concerned about self benefits , such as social status , reputation and money .
This phenomenon is partially a result of the social prejudice that the society respects those with power more than intelligentsias .
Academic demoralization and corruption are common nowadays .
Money for research is wasted on some vanity projects; cheating and plagiarism are carried out in order to win a reputation .
Paper , as the major measurement of one's achievement in academic circles , causes the situation to be even worse .
In order to issue more papers in some magazines , some engineers even use money to buy the opportunities of issuing their articles .
These problems in academic circle are impeding engineering design .
Having recognized the factors which are hampering the engineering design process of innovations , we must take action to change the serious situation .
Improving the education system and developing right academic atmosphere are essential and urgent .
Only removing the obstacles can engineers develop science and technology and design new things of innovations .
Technology is a material object which is used to increase the ability to adapt to one's environment ("Technology ," 2009) .
To produce technology , one has to make a project involving professionals .
Because the project usually spends a lot of money , one should have a backup , such as a company , to give financial support .
In conventional way , one should receive an approval from the corporate executives due to the company bureaucracy in order to do the project .
However , there are some projects which are not approved by the corporate executives .
Most people will just obey the decision .
Nonetheless , there are some people who are not satisfied with the decision made by the corporate executives , and these people dare to challenge the executives' decision by doing the project in a skunkworks environment .
Thus , technology can be derived from a project which is done either in a conventional way or in a skunkworks environment .
A conventionally generated technology and an innovation that was created in a skunkworks environment differ in organizational structure and time consumption , but similar in the doers and the purpose .
One obvious difference is the organizational structure .
People who do the project in a conventional way should receive an approval from the corporate executives before these people start the project .
These people have to submit a proposal of the project and wait for the executives' decision , which is based on the company situation .
In some cases , although the idea of the project was brilliant , the executives rejected the proposal due to the economic situation of the company .
For instance , Toshiba's corporate leaders denied Tetsuya Mizoguchi's request on the laptop project (Rogers , 2003) .
In contrast , a project which is done in a skunkworks environment does not undergo the company's bureaucracy .
In other words , the start of skunkworks does not depend on the executives' decision .
As a result of the difference in organizational structure , a conventionally generated technology and an innovation that was created in a skunkworks environment also differ in time consumption .
The project which is done in a conventional way needs more time due to the approval of the corporate executives .
Consequently , the project which is done in a skunkworks environment consumes less time than the conventional one .
This is why in 1943 , the Air Tactical Service Command (ATSC) of the Army Air Force gave Lockheed Aircraft Corporation a command to build a jet fighter due to the rapidly growing German jet ("Skunk Works ," n .d .) .
Despite these differences , a conventionally generated technology and an innovation that was created in a skunkworks environment have two similarities .
Firstly , both of them are handled by professionals .
Due to the complexity of the project , an unskilled person would not be able to do the project .
For instance , Ron Avitzur and Greg Robbins needed professional quality assurance people to test the project and professional writing software people to write the software in the graphing calculator project (Avitzur , 2004) .
Secondly , both innovations have the same purpose in general .
The purpose is to improve the welfare of society by increasing the ability to adapt to the environment .
For instance , hand phone is made in order to communicate with another person in the different place in an easier way .
A conventionally generated technology and an innovation that was created in a skunkworks environment are different but alike .
Though they are different in organizational structure and time consumption , but both still have similarities in the doers and the purpose .
Since a company still have to consider a number of factors when making a decision , bureaucracy in the company will not be gone .
However , by looking at the efficiency of the skunkworks , it is possible for a company to reduce the bureaucracy in order to come out with more innovations .
As science and technology develops faster and faster nowadays , more and more machines and instruments are created .
However , machines need energy which is always generated from coal , petrol and so forth .
As we all know , the resource mentioned above is non-renewable , and it is also limited .
Then a new problem comes out .
What if human use up the resource in the world ?
What can human live on ?
So , we need to create machines which consume less energy .
In addition , we also need to find new energy to replace old non renewable resources .
An energy crisis may break out because people cry for energy but the resources are limited now .
The step of industrialization becomes faster and faster , so numerous energies are needed .
As resources consumption increases rapidly and they are limited , there are fewer resources for people to use .
And the crisis of shortage of energies has come out to some extent .
Graham Smith and Hazel Rudge-Pickard(n .d .) reported that , "The UK currently has around sixty million people .
Without oil it could support maybe twenty million but probably less because there will be no oil to power farm machines , no fertilizer to grow strong crops and no herbicides or pesticides to keep the weeds and insects at bay .
We will be sent back to a pre-industrial revolution world with no hope of it ending ."
from this report , we can realize the significance of solving this crisis .
Innovation of new machines which consume less energy is a good way to solve the problem .
Since there is less energy , we should reduce consumption first .
We can save energy by improving new technology .
Engineers can design new kinds of machines and find new material which can be used to manufacture instruments so that less energy can be consumed .
In addition , finding some new energy is also a feasible solution to prevent the crisis .
There will be a day when we use up all the resources .
So for solving this problem , we should also look for new kinds of energy , such as bio energy , i .e .
eco energy , solar energy and so on .
Take the bio energy as an example .
The bio-energy is that energy obtained from bio-fuel (eco-fuel) .
Today , the well known bio-fuel (the biological one) are ethanol and biodiesel .
They are obtained from plants and used mostly in transportation .
(Emilian M . Dobrescu and Ciolacu C . B .C .
,2009) Since the fuel generates from plants , it means that new energy is renewable .
It can be produced and never limited .
We can implement sustainable development regardless of shortage of resources .
So engineers should do more research on new energy and take more fearless experiments to see if there are some plants can be used to produce energy .
In fact , the new energy is the key to prevent the crisis .
Human has faced a very serious problem , the crisis of shortage of energy .
Because the speed of industrial development increases so fast , more energy is needed .
This leads to the shortage of fuel or resources .
So what engineers should do is to invent new machines which can consume less energy and find new sorts of resources to replace the old non renewable one .
The crisis will almost be solved if we take these two solutions into action .
Furthermore , Engineers should take responsibility to make contribution to the solution , to produce products which can make human live better .
In recent years , Singapore has placed more and more emphasis on research and development , establishing her status of being home to innovations .
Annually , millions of funds are being pumped into the R&D sector to encourage innovations to offer solutions to the pressing challenges Singapore faces .
Indeed , great success has been achieved , for instance Singapore's clean water technology is widely recognized by the world .
The large scale research and development effort has placed Singapore as the leader in new water technologies especially in membrane applications .
Despite her huge success in many areas , Singapore does face problems which hamper engineering design processes for innovations .
One problem faced by engineering design in Singapore is the various restrictions due to socio-political system of the country .
Innovations are restricted by the many rules and regulations the country imposed , and sometimes the over emphasis of specific policies which causes development of ideas in an irrelevant area to be neglected .
Singapore is renowned for her strict implementation of rules , and in times it may be seen as too inflexible .
As such , innovations in the contentious areas are often restricted .
The ideas eventually accepted are shaped primarily by commercial interests and governmental policies .
In recent years , the core objectives of the country's research and development project have been directed in the area of clean energy and water technology .
Various programmes have been initiated to establish Singapore as the Global Clean Energy Hub , for instance the Clean Energy Research Programme , which is a competitive funding scheme to encourage innovations in this area .
However , the over exertion of her efforts may simply cause innovations in the other areas to be neglected .
As a result , innovation process is interrupted at the stage of research and development with the absence of supports and attention .
Aside from this , innovations that are radically different face even greater problems in being accepted .
This can be attributed to the inflexibility of the system causing rejection of innovations that is less relevant with the corporate or country's interest .
Another problem faced by engineers in Singapore is the limitations in resources .
Despite having the most advance infrastructure , the best institute for research , Singapore still lacks the resources for certain development .
Due to her limitations , innovations in some areas are restricted since the accessibility to resources would be too difficult and pose potential problems .
High cost may be incurred for certain research when scarce resource or externally imported resources involved .
Foreign experts may also be engaged to facilitate researches .
Hence the lack of resources adds hindrance to the process of innovation .
Aside from the lack of resources for the research and development stage , difficulties may be faced in finding suitable target group for the innovation result within the country .
The low population of the country disables experimentation on a large scale basic which eventually may cause inaccuracy in the result .
Indeed just earlier this year , a team of National University of Singapore researchers find themselves facing this problem .
The team came up with a chair that turns sound into vibrations , which can potentially help the deaf to experience sound better .
However , a problem was faced when they attempt to test out the chair .
They could not get access to enough deaf children locally for the test thus had to travel to Sri Lanka for the test out .
In the engineering of the eco-car , it is also evident that the lack of resources poses great deal of challenges to the team of NUS students , having to import the materials outside of Singapore .
Hence the process of engineering design is hampered by the lack of resource not only at stages of research and development , but also in the diffusion of the innovation .
In conclusion , despite Singapore's efforts in establishing herself as the Home for Innovations , engineer are compelled by several restrictions such as lack of resources and the inflexibility of the social system .
However , it does not mean engineering design in Singapore is not favorable .
In fact , great success has been achieved in some areas where it face less restrictions .
In the 21st century , everything develops in a very fast pace .
The needs of human beings increase .
In order to meet the people's needs , the engineers or scientists start to do research and design something for the people's sake .
They keep on trying and repeating the experiments , and eventually succeed to generate a new technology .
The serendipitous discovery of new ideas therefore , sometimes comes out during the trials .
No matter the technology was resulted from a long period of research or a serendipitous discovery , this technology must have been done by a group or an individual who has already acquired certain knowledge .
They are believed to have undergone many researches and discussions .
According to Rogers (2003) , six main stages are involved in the way to come out the technology , they are recognizing a problem , research , development , commercialization , diffusion and adoption and consequences .
This is not an easy works but requires times and efforts to deal with it .
Moreover , although the serendipitous idea is not the desirable outcome , it benefits the world .
The notable example that I want to discuss here is penicillin .
It was accidentally discovered by Alexander Fleming during his investigation about the properties of staphylococci .
This antibiotic is the first drug that is effective against the syphilis and staphylococcus infections .
It successfully saved the people who suffered from the diseases and gave them happiness to have the chance to live again .
In brief , the two products , laptop and penicillin , are either generated through a long period of research or a serendipitous discovery , they are both made out to meet the people's requirements .
Although they may not be the best outcome to fulfil the people's needs , they still lead the world to a technological innovation .
Topic: How electrical dictionary is shaped by students' need and the specific factors that have shaped its innovation .
I have been witnessed the development of electronic dictronary .
From the huge one with the simplest function to today's lovely and multi-functional one , electronic dictronary have been refined again and again .
By saying electronic dictronary , I refer to the small handheld computer which people commonly use to look up words .
The development of electronic dictronary is deeply shaped by the need of students , who are the majority of their customers .
In the latter paragraphs , i will talk about how students' need determine the development of electronic dictronary .
The most obevious change is that the function of electronic dictronary has greatly improved due to the change in students demand .
At the very beginning , it can do nothing but look up words .
In comparision , nowadays electronic dictronary are much more multi-functional .
For example , it can not only look up words in Chinese and English as the old one does , but also many other languages , like Japanese and Franch as well .
It is intellectualized , which enables the users to enrich their electronic dictronary as they like .
And what they need to do is simply downloading programms and install them in the electronic dictronary .
Moreover , as students are not content with a boring study tool , electronic dictronary today can act as good company during leisure time because it possesses the function of MP3/MP4 player and even PSP !
Another significant improvement is the appearance of electronic dictronary .
Instead of the hand-size one , it is only lemon-size big now with a much lighter weight .
As a direct result , it is convience to carry and win students' regards .
As English is a complusary course to learn in China , electronic dictronary has almost become a necessity to students .
And nearly everyone has one .
Thus it is not simply a tool , but a personal belonging to reprsent their appitite and modernise .
The electronic dictronary with an outstanding look allows students to show off around their fellows .
So the surface becomes bright-colored and beautifully decorated .
All these changes are aimed to cater for students taste and finally attract their attention .
Last but not least , the price of electronic dictronary is also influenced by students .
As students do not have job , they have to ask their parents for money .
Hence they can not spend too much on an electronic dictronary .
In addition , the limitation of electronic dictronary , such as no access to the the Internet , also determines that the price of electronic dictronary can not be too high .
It can not be as expensive as a computer .
In conclusion , electronic dictronary plays an importance role in students' study , and students in return shape and decide the development of electronic dictronary in many aspects , like price , appearance and function .
It can be seen that as technology develops , electronic dictronary will be more and more helpful to students .
Before a technology innovation is developed and patented , scientists have to go through a tedious research process most of the time .
However , there are also occasional chances that R&D workers fortuitously discover an invention when they were actually pursuing something else .
Whichever way an invention is created , it helps satisfy human needs and solve existing problems .
However , there are still differences between a technology developed with via research such as the electric car and one serendipitously discovered like penicillin .
All technological innovations , regardless of their developing process , help solve world problems .
In view of the increasing emphasis of eco friendliness , the US General Motor R&D unit developed the electric car IMPACT during the early 1990s .
This development received great responses from people throughout the US as it signifies one big step towards solving existing environmental problems such as the global warming .
Similarly , Alexander Fleming's discovery of Penicillin made many deadly diseases such as Tuberculosis curable .
This groundbreaking discovery also won Fleming a Nobel Prize .
Therefore , the common factor of all technological developments is that they address existing social problems , in one way or another .
However , there are still differences between an innovation that is developed via continuous research and one that is serendipitously discovered .
These discrepancies can be further categorized in terms of their purpose , procedure and effect .
The conventional innovation process requires the engineers to first identify a human need before the research officially begin .
This ensures that the research has a proper target .
Take the development of electric cars as an example , engineers recognized the increasing emphasis on eco friendliness , and therefore developed the vehicle without fuel powered engine to ease global warming .
On the other hand , a serendipitously discovered product is not the preset goal that the researchers want to achieve .
Its application is realized after the product has already been created .
Alexander Fleming did not expect to discover penicillin mould when he left the petri dish containing Staphylococcus plate culture open .
Therefore , an innovation involving continuous research and development differs from an accidental discovery as the former is a rational problem solving process while the latter is more of a lucky surprise .
Apart from the difference in purpose , the conventional innovation products and the one serendipitously discovered also undergo different research and development procedures .
The conventional products usually go through careful planning stages , making the whole development process well prepared .
These innovations are usually backed by solid technological background , expertise and sufficient funds .
GM allocated $2 billion for designing , manufacturing and marketing of their electric car IMPACT , after which expert diffusion scholars helped in campaigning for the product throughout the United States .
Within one year , the first tier of cars was put into mass production .
On the contrary , when Fleming discovered penicillin mould , he then had to refer his discovery to Charles Thom , an American specialist for further research .
It took more than 10 years for penicillin to be eventually purified and applied to medical use .
Lastly , the immediate effectiveness of a conventional innovation may be more conspicuous than that of a fortuitous discovery .
The centralized research procedure gives engineers more careful thoughts in the development of a conventional innovation .
The technological product created is thus more sophiscated and addresses human need more directly .
On the other hand , accidental discovery may be too crude for actual application immediately .
After Fleming had discovered penicillin , a series of specialists , including himself , had to carry out tedious research trials to further improve penicillin to ensure stable reaction on human bodies .
In conclusion , technological products developed via research do differ from those serendipitous discoveries in terms of their purposes , research procedures and immediate effects .
Despite of this fact , these products all serve to solve existing problems .
Yet technological innovation is not like a lottery game .
Instead , it should be a conscientious and exact pursuit of solutions .
Although there are occasional lucky winners , engineers should still put in every endeavour in all research processes .
Technological innovations shaped the modern lifestyle .
We use electricity , watch television , surfing around the billions of website every day .
Some of those inventions have become an essential part of our life and we cannot live without these inventions .
However , it is clear that these inventions are not produced overnight and human beings had put in a lot of time and efforts to develop and generate them .
Generally , innovations can be generated in two ways -- conventional research or skunkwork .
There are some differences and similarities between the technologies created in the two different backgrounds .
One of the main differences between conventionally generated technology and skunkwork product is the speed of generating the product .
According to Rogers (2003) , skunkwork refers to a small group of highly selected people designated to do research for an innovation without carry out tedious organization procedures .
While conventional research requires the researchers to do large amount of reports , discussions and management procedures , skunkwork provides pathway to develop an invention quickly without being constrained by bureaucratic processes .
Therefore , innovations that were created in a skunkwork environment are usually created faster than those inventions created by conventional research .
For example , Roger (2003) states that the skunkwork of producing laptop , lead by Mizoguchi , involves 10 engineers from military projects and takes only 24 months to complete .
In contrast , a conventionally generated technology may not have move that fast .
Conventional research involves a lot of management procedures .
The research must be approved by the corporate leaders before it can be carried out .
Therefore , conventionally generated technology usually moves slower than that of the skunkwork production .
To sum up , conventionally generated technology and skunkwork invention bear some differences and shares some common points .
Although they differs in the procedure throughout the development of a technology , the 2 ways are heading towards a common goalto produce a better environment for human beings .
Engineering design process is a suitable method that allows engineers to analyze the problems and developing solutions to it .
It breaks down those critical sections and allows the project to proceed in an orderly manner with proper guidelines .
The following is an example of using engineering design process as an approach to solve the problem .
The topic that is catching most attention nowadays would be on global warming or climatic change .
Many engineers and scientists are brainstorming for new ideas to prevent global warming from worsening .
According to National Geographic (August , 2009) , the 'Big Idea' is to launch millions of reflective particles or tiny 'sun shades' into space (between the Earth and the Sun) .
These ideas may sound ludicrous , however it is the easiest method that enables us to store more time while we change our lifestyle and prepares for global warming .
Launching a few huge sunshades at the altitude , especially at the poles and oceans , this allows some of the heat to be reflected away from them , thus reducing the temperature and melting of glaciers .
Our oceans absorb tremendous quantities of heat that was emitted by the Sun due to the high heat capacity of water .
A relationship is established between the rising sea level and the rise in temperature (or carbon dioxide concentration) , the graph below is taken from a scientific journal 'Climatic Dynamics' which shows us the relationship .
[pic]
Launching of sunshades has two advantages , firstly to store enough time to change our lifestyle permanently , example reduce in poultry consumption , reducing the usage of non-environmental friendly materials .
Secondly , to develop more advance technologies such as clean fuel and energy conserving systems .
However , this is not a permanent solution to solve the problem , it is a mitigation step that slows down the crisis from occurring .
It is necessary for us to remove those "sunshades" when Earth starts to cool down , glaciers reform and most importantly , when we (humans) are ready .
Ergonomics , Product Safety and Liability and Mechanical/Strength Analysis
Locating the sunshades at remote areas , reduce the probability of injuries in case of any accident .
The material use for the sunshades will mainly be some reflective materials , example sulfate .
It is important that the sunshades are able to stay within the designated area when the Earth orbits around the Sun .
Sunshades switch over would be carry out periodically , as maintenance work could be quite tedious as changing of parts will requires the sun shades to ascend down .
High durability , battery life and able to function at low temperatures must be considered during the design phase .
Economic and Market Analysis
This method allows us to combat global warming easily and fastest compared to many other solutions .
Ken Caldeira , a climate expert at the Carnegie Institution said , "If a country starts thinking it's in their vital interests to do this , and they have the power , I find it hard to imagine them not doing it ."
Identify and Establish the Need , Develop a Problem Statement
In brief , geoengineering solution allows us to fight global warming temporary , it is just a mitigation approach and not a preventive one .
It is still dependent on us to start changing our lifestyle and cut down on carbon emissions , just in case the sunshades fail , the crisis that we have been masking would soon rush towards us at once .
There are many different views and stands about global warming , discussions are still carrying out between the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and delegates from oil and gas industry .
Regardless of the conclusion , at the end of the day , we are still required to prepare for the worst situation .
How can planet Earth and the entire human species escape from this impending crisis ?
Many people have been trying tremendously hard in reducing the carbon emission by using clean energy or going into a vegetarian diet .
These methods do work , but only minority of the population is doing it , and results could only be seen after many years of efforts .
Establish Criteria for Success
Earth is heated up by the Sun's energy and many believe that the increasing amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere worsen global warming by retaining more heat .
Instead of reducing the carbon emission , we can solve this impending crisis by finding some methods that reduces the heat source or able to manipulate the heat input onto Earth .
2 .
Gather pertinent information
Search for Information Resources
Research has shown that whenever a volcano erupts , it releases large amount of dust and gaseous chemicals causing a thick layer of haze to form around the planet , thus reducing the average temperature of Earth by almost one degree Fahrenheit .
3 .
Generate multiple solutions
Engineering designing plays a key role in technological innovation .
According to Seyyed Khandani (2005) , engineering design includes creating technological products which have never existed before and improving the existing devices or systems .
There are five basic steps for solving a design problem: define the problem , gather pertinent information , generate multiple solutions , analyze and select a solution , and test and implement the solution .
Although the description of the designing process is simple and clear , the implement of engineering design is rather complicated and requires several crucial qualities .
Two of the most important qualities are creative thinking skills and intensive working habbit .
However , two problems in China deprived them of these two qualities .
First of all , Chinese education system largely destroyed students' creative thinking skills .
Inovative thinking contains natural curiosity and bold imagination whereas analytical thinking is comprised of experiences .
The schools in China usually aim at cultivating students' analytical skills by teaching them knowledge and testing them on the knowledge been taught .
But the education system doesn't encourage students to think out of the box to give their own answers or to explore the mysterious world .
This "education for examination" strategy have two negative impact on engineering design .
First , it prevents students from detecting real problems by themselves which is essential in the first step of engineering design .
As the experiences filling up students' minds , their curiosity is fading day by day until they don't even bother to take notice the world surrounding them .
In addition , it limits the possible solutions students could come up with , therefore hampers the third step .
Examination often denies imagination .
Hence students gradually lose the ability to conceive fresh ideas .
However , the best way to solve a problem may not be taught by lecturers and books .
Sometimes , we need to use our own brain to find it out .
Secondly , Chinese society destracted engineers from devoting into innovative work .
In scientific world , most of the greatest contributers are from western countires; the only two Chinese scientist who won Nobel Prize developed their theories in America .
Similarly , in technological area , Chinese engineers seldom have breakthroughs .
These phenomena can be largely subscribed to the impulsive atmosphere of Chinese society .
As a result of the impulsive atmosphere , Chinese government focused too much on economic development but input too little on technological research .
Compared with the developed countries , China stressed more on implement rather than generation of engineering design .
Besides the indifference from government , engineers also didn't attach much importance to engineering design .
Engineering design is a meaningful work but requires lots of sacrifice and devotion since it couldn't generate benefits promplty and directly .
Hence , this impulsive atmosphere seriously impacts the whole engineering design .
The lack of innovative thinking skills and the indifference to the creative work have already hampered Chinese engineering design .
To promote creative-centered research and design , China have to transform greatly in these two dimensions .
In Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs , health clinches the second platform of the pyramid under the classification of safety needs .
Health , good health in particular , is an important part of our lives .
The Prime Minister in his National Day Rally speech gave immense significance to healthcare .
With health being the subject of conversation in most places , it would not be wrong to classify good health as a need in today's world .
The measures taken to improve the healthcare system worldwide ranges from the fundamental implementation of affordable healthcare in poor countries to the more advanced introduction of stem cell research .
With one notion of improving the healthcare system , man has even delved into surgery assisted by robots .
Some might find this assisted surgery difficult to fathom while others might argue about the competency of such a system .
Amidst all these opposition , the Da Vinci surgical system rose prominently from the California company intuitive surgical .
This Da Vinci surgical system would not have been made possible without the engineering design process as described by Khandani .
The engineering design process gears up with , first , defining and understanding a problem , The brainchild of the Da Vinci surgical system was the primary need to make the surgical process a less invasive one .
To put it in better words , it was to reduce the size of incisions and to forego the need to crack bones or rib cages .
The problem in this case is the intrusiveness of the surgical procedure on the human body .
With the problem reinstated , it then becomes crucial to mark down the requirements towards accomplishing the design .
However , as mentioned by Khandani , following the development of the design solution , these requirements will have to reviewed later .
Initially , the requirements for this design to kick start were its effectiveness in performing surgery , its ability to be user-friendly and the capacity of it to work without posing potential danger to the patient .
Overall , with the base of the design process carefully established , it would be easier to get to the imminent task .
Following the defining of the problem was the task of gathering sufficient information .
Lack of information would turn out to be potentially lethal to any design process and the Da Vinci surgical system was no exception to this .
The spectrum of information was spread out in all ways , from the need to understand possible fallbacks in the design process to previous attempts at creating the surgical system .
Khandani in his viewpoint mentioned various sources of information like the internet and library .
Information , being a liabilty , will first have to be sourced out and then scrutinized to the minute details .
With information as a good layback , the design can grace the next stage which is the formulation of many solutions to the problem .
With concised understanding of the problem and important information , the design will move to the next stage of creating solutions .
A single solution alone will not be able to suffice in making the design a roaring success .
A good engineer will have to contemplate on various solutions and from various angles .
After gathering various solutions to the problem at hand , Khandhani suggested narrowing down to one solution after considering the pros and cons of each solution .
Making surgery less invasive could mean inventing other instruments but the reason a robot was chosen signifies the importance of surgery .
The lives of patients cannot be placed in jeopardy and inventing a design that comprises on safety of the patient was an absolute no .
In the case of the Da Vinci surgical system , it will not be able to function unless it detects the presence of the surgeon's head in the viewer .
This was indication that the surgery was still in safe hands and was the best solution to making surgery less invasive .
Therefore the solution was specified and the design process was nearing completion .
Having a solution to the problem did not indicate a successful design process until the design was tested and implemented .
This stage depicts the take off of the design for the first time after many trial attempts and failures .
Khandani in his article mentioned four sub categories in the take off which are namely prototyping , concurrent engineering , documentation and applying for patents .
A good engineer will have to consider these sub categories before his creation takes place .
In context to the Da Vinci surgical system , take off of the system also meant clearance by the FDA .
The FDA's approval formed another sub category other than those mentioned by Khadhani in his article .
July 2000 was a significant date in the history of the Da Vinci surgical system and was a mark that the world was taking the first step towards digital surgery .
July 2000 was the date the surgical system could perform advanced surgical techniques .
The opportunity to test and implement meant that the surgical system was ready to start its race in addressing health concerns .
In conclusion , the need of the world and the attempts to address the need required one to go through an engineering design process .
Health was the need in this case and the Da Vinci surgical system went through the design process .
It is worthwhile to note how the healthcare system as a problem metamorphosized into the generation of solution in the name of the Da Vinci surgical system .
The engineering design process as Khandhani clearly paints in his article is the guiding tool for various important inventions .
Overall , the system is an effective design that has addressed the health concern of the world .
In ancient China , there were four great inventions , the gunpowder , printing , the compass and paper making .
However in modern times , the engineering design developed very slowly .
Why did this happen ?
I think there are many reasons .
In the Qing dynasty , the governing class implemented closed door policy , which made the society stagnated for a long time .
Then the Cultural Revolution made a deep effect on Chinese society which needed another long time for China to recovery .
Even nowadays there are still some problems existed which hamper the engineering design process .
Here we are going to talk about two problems , the examination-oriented education system and the worship of authorities .
The examination-oriented education , as the name implies , is the education whose purpose is getting high grades in the exam .
Teachers teach for the exam .
Students study for the exam .
This results that students have high scores but low abilities .
In the first stage of the engineering design process--define the problem , people need an active mind to design problem , but many students under the examination-oriented education system only know how to use their knowledge to answer the question on the examination paper , they do not know how to use knowledge to solve the real problems .
In the third step of the design processgenerate multiple solutions , this needs divergent thinking and analytical skills , whereas the examinationoriented education do not emphasis the importance of thinking and skills .
Its only purpose is high score in the exam .
The skills which needed in the design process cannot be gain from such an education system .
Chinese educationalists have noticed this problem .
They have implemented another education system , education for allrounded development , which emphasis that developing students' abilities is the most important thing .
These problems hampered the process of engineering design for innovation .
When there are problems , there also must be some ways to solve the problems .
China has already find ways to solve these problems , but solving these problems needs time .
I believe that one day there is no problem in the way to innovation in China .
In view of the rising fuel prices in the recent decade , car manufacturers have addressed the need to reduce costs in production , so as to be able to pass on minimal costs to the consumers , yet still remain competitive and appealing in the market .
To invest , research and produce the electric car is a good deal in the long run , mainly because the car runs on electricity that is of a much lower cost than fuel .
Furthermore , this would reduce the dependency on fuel in the future for cars , should one day the world has run out of fuel .
With this in mind , the car manufacturer General Motors embarked on a $2 billion project on designing , manufacturing and marketing the electric vehicles in the early 1990s (Rogers , 2003) .
They had received an overwhelming response from the masses to test-drive the new car when they launched their test-drive campaign .
Mavens , who were specialists and consultants in their own field of expertise , were selected .
They provided opinions and disseminating the information of the electric car to the larger market , which eventually boosted the total car sales of GM when they officially launched their first electric car into the market in the late 1990s (Rogers , 2003) .
From the economic viewpoint , the technology of the electric car would benefit the manufacturers from the reductions of their production costs in the long run , and this would spur them on to increase their production with improved technology .
One of the more outstanding features of an electric car is its non-polluting factor .
With increased global warming and rapid emissions of greenhouse gases from factories and fuel-powered vehicles , there is an urgent need to reduce these emissions and the clean technology of the electric car is one of the solutions to address the environmental concerns .
To invest in the green technology would therefore require a significant amount of financial resources , and to encourage continuation in this area of research , the government plays a role as a banker to grant incentives to these companies .
In early August this year , US President Obama had announced that incentives of $2 .4 billion are to be pumped into the development of the eco-friendly technology (CNN .com , 2009) .
With the financial aid from the government and the promising potential sales of the electric cars in the market , the car manufacturers are much complied to design , improve and thus , market these cars while the heat is still on .
Even back in the 1990s , the government had already taken action to encourage the innovation of electric cars .
The California and Arizona state governments had announced and made compulsory for 10 per cent of the total car sales in the market to be environmentally-friendly , so as to reduce the pollution levels in their states (Rogers , 2003) .
Social construction of technology is also what called as the social determinist technology .
The electric car is clearly an example of such technology because as early as 1990s , the environmental issues were already present such that the government had to take action to mitigate the situation .
It was only due to economic reasons recently that the production of electric cars is stepped up .
Behind the scenes , the birth of the technology of the electric car is primarily due to the society reasons then , and even till today , the electric car is constantly being re-designed and improvised with better technology so as to remain competitive in the market and most importantly , eco-friendly on the roads .
There is a legend that has been fascinating people from some one thousand year ago: God was going to send a deluge to destroy the earth and almost all the living things on earth which had become corrupt .
However , taking pity on what he had created , he instructed Noah to build a big vessel to save some species of the creatures .
Ultimately , the great flood wiped out all the beings except those Noah have conserved on the ark .
This Bible version of saving the dying out creatures inspired scientists to work on a new "Noah Ark" , or a "doomsday" conservancy , to store genetic materials in case of future use for both scientific purpose and biological diversity .
However , this time , the one who destroys the earth is no more the god but human beings themselves .
As a matter of fact , the Earth's population is currently increasing , coupled with pollution , urban sprawl , deforestation , and climate warming which caused serious damages to the habitats of the plants and animals .
These series of human activities with their negative effects on the environment directly lead to an inevitable consequence: species extinction .
Dr . Donald A . Levin , Professor of Biology , University of Texas , Austin once claimed in the January-February issue of American Scientist magazine , "Although the extinction of various species is a natural phenomenon , the rate of extinction occurring in today's world is exceptional -- as many as 100 to1 ,000 times greater than normal ."
The alarm-bells have been rung , which draws worldwide attention .
Both scientists and environmentalists are endeavoring to change the situation , and fortunately there is good news for those who really care about the endangered creatures .
Besides the set up biological laboratories , various kinds of DNA repositories have been built while more plans are under way .
So far , there are already more than 1 ,400 seed banks in the world , in addition to those are intended for both plants and animal DNA storage .
A technical question may be raised from the public: how to store DNA ?
Newspapers revealed some information on this issue .
Genetic material Samples are placed inside tiny vials , which then were put into numbered boxes with special code respectively .
The temperatures of vats storing the species are normally adjusted to -160 to -18 degrees Celsius depending on different species .
In the vats there is liquid nitrogen , but samples are perched above 20 centimeters of it to let the vapor , instead of the liquid itself cool and preserve the genetic information .
As such , specimens can be perfectly stored for some 1000 years .
However , can the problem of species extinction really be solved by this technology ?
Since this particular technology came into being under the influence of human activities , it will definitely continue changing .
In other words , when the technology becomes more mature and more profitable in the future (which is very possible) , it is very hard to guarantee that it will only be put into good use .
What if the issue involves crime , disease or simply moral controversy like cloning ?
The outcome remains to be seen .
Anyway , social requirement created it and it is meeting the allowable needs for the time being .

Technologies have the capabilities of solving problems and improving on our daily life .
In order to come out with useful technologies , Rogers (2003) states that the process involves research for more in depth understanding of scientific knowledge , followed by research to solve specific problem and finally , development of the technologies .
However , in the mist of researching on a particular technology , discovery of new technologies may appear unexpectedly .
There are both similarities and differences between technologies developed via research and technologies resulted from a serendipitous discovery .
For example , the invention of laptops and the discovery of 3M Post-it pads respectively .
Laptops and Post-it pads are both favorable to us in one way or another .
In the case where space constraint is of concern , laptops will be the solution .
This is due to the fact that the size of laptops is much smaller than desktop computers as the latter consist of monitors as well as central processing units (CPU) .
According to Rogers (2003) , "the laptop made particular sense in Japan , due to crowded offices and small homes" .
Similarly , the 3M Post-it pads are useful to us in our daily life .
With Post-its , any notes , instructions or reminders can be written on it and attached to "a letter or other document" (Rogers , 2003) .
Hence , both inventions are beneficial to us .
The two technologies also possess another similarity , that is , they are both profitable .
According to Rogers (2003) , laptops demand increased from 5 ,000 units per month in 1986 to 100 ,000 in 1989 .
Nowadays , laptops are still widely used all over the world by students as well as businessmen .
This infers that laptops are doing well in the market .
Likewise , Post-it pads are "one of the 3M's most profitable products" (Rogers , 2003) .
Thus , both the laptops and the Post-it pads are profitable .
However , between these two technologies , one of their differences is how the idea came about .
For invention of laptops , idea came about when there was a problem to be solved , which is , "due to crowded offices and small homes" (Rogers , 2003) in Japan .
On the other hand , for the 3M Post-it pads , the unexpected discovery came about when 3M researchers are investigating on a new adhesive (Rogers , 2003) .
Therefore , the creation of Post-it pads is unintentional while creation of laptop is with intended purposes .
Another difference between the two technologies is regarding the room for further development .
For laptops , advancements are constantly introduced to attract the market .
For example , there are faster processors and more internal memory space being incorporated .
In addition to that , shrinking of laptops sizes and the variations of designs makes them even more attractive than before .
There will surely be more enhancements to come in the near future .
However , for Post-it pads , the developments are probably limited to colors , shapes , size and the extent of how sticky it is .
Hence , in terms of future developments , laptops may have a better prospect as compared to Post- it pads .
In conclusion , both technologies , which were either developed by research or by chance , have its similarities as well as differences .
Although there are certain differences between them , the characteristics that both are profitable and useful in our daily life operation in one way or the other are important elements when developing a technology .
Therefore , no matter whether the creation is based on research or luck , as long as it benefits us in one way or the other , it is a great invention .
According to Rogers (2003) , the development of technologies can be examined from a technologically determinist perspective , that is to create a revolution in the society .
However , for technologies to be widely adopted and successful , inputs from the society must never be neglected .
In fact , innovations are more often shaped by social aspects .
One example of such technology is the 3-D printer .
The 3-D printer currently available has the ability to produce complex model of differing shapes and sizes in a short duration .
In addition , it can print on various materials ranging from rubber to plastic .
These properties of the 3-D printer are consequences of psychological and economic factors .
Present technology is insufficient to convince investors to finance proposals , especially in the manufacturing or construction sector .
While computer-aided designing software is available to produce 3-D simulation , it lacks realism .
Since such project involves huge amount of money , investors must be ascertained that their commitment will bring them profit .
One way of convincing them is to produce physical prototypes where that can feel and scrutinize .
Secondly , creating models with traditional means is time consuming , which does not make economical sense to businesses .
Companies are often engaged in a race to unveil their product ahead of their competitors , so as to seize a major share of the marketplace .
In such situation , time is of essence .
In consideration of these factors , designers have conceived the 3-D printer , which is capable of speeding up designing process .
Based on a report in The Economist (2009) , it now takes Timberland merely ninety minutes to turn a design of a new sole into a model using the 3-D printer , a significant decrease from a week that the process requires in the past .
The factors that shaped the technological innovation of the 3-D printer discuss thus far are coming from the end-user perspective .
However , factors from the manufacture's viewpoint are also considered to ensure the commercial success of the 3-D printer .
These factors have also influenced the design of the 3-D printer .
The designing of the 3-D printer is also influenced by the potential profitability of it .
The development of the technical aspects of a technology involves the devotion of large amount of resources , which will results in increased cost .
As with all business operators , corporate manufacturers must ensure that their product is profitable , or at the basic able to recuperate the financial resources poured into research and development .
The designers of the 3-D printer had ensured that their product appeal to a large consumer group by boosting its functionality .
As mentioned in The Economist (2009) , the "machine can not only produce things out-of plastic , but also complex ones with moving parts ."
In conclusion , the technological innovation of the 3-D printer is shaped by the demand for realistic model that can be produced in a short time .
Besides , it is also influenced by the potential profitability of the corporate manufacturer .
The engineering design processes as described by Khandani(2005) provides a well-rounded methodology to come up with solutions to a need .
The process starts with identifying the underlying cause of the need to effectively solve the problem at hand , followed by research on the topic for better understanding .
Brainstorming for solutions comes next and the engineer lists out all the possible solutions for self-critique later .
Armed with more information on the problem , the engineer would be able to make better decisions on the final solution to optimise on and adaptation as a prototype .
The focus of this essay is; however , on the ways the engineering design processes help fulfil a particular need .
Therefore the final step of implementing the solution will not be discussed .
In 1997 , a group of countries agreed to commit to the Kyoto Protocol , which aims towards a reduction of greenhouse gases emitted in view of the potential climatic changes to come should the situation be left unattended to .
Today , even as many other countries have taken small steps towards the control of greenhouse emissions , the fact remains that a large portion of the energy we generate for human consumption still comes from the burning of fossil fuels .
There is therefore a need for a more environmentally friendly way to generate the energy for our use .
The development of a problem statement gives the engineer a chance to look into the elements which the need is comprised of .
In this case , to reduce the undesirable emissions of mainly carbon dioxide , sulphur dioxide and the oxides of nitrogen in order to provide environmentally friendlier energy .
With the aid of a clear problem statement , the engineer is able to tackle the problem at its core by following through with an objective-specific statement .
In the last step of our discussion , the analysis and therefore selection of a single solution for adaptation , falls back heavily upon previous research .
The engineer must be mindful of various factors and make a choice towards one solution which balances the criterion he deems necessary for his product to meet the need .
I defined the more important requirements of the final solution to be its ease of acceptance by users , the extent of reduction of undesirable emissions and the time taken for implementation and effect .
Comparing the two solutions , alternate sources of energy like wind energy , hydroelectric energy or nuclear energy significantly reduces the amount of greenhouse gas produced .
However , it is not likely that they will be able to replace the current infrastructures of fossil fuel generators at a quick rate due to high start-up costs , and in some cases geographical constraints .
Hence , despite being an ideal solution in the long run , alternate energy sources are unable to curb the problem now .
On the other hand , increasing efficiency of current generators allow for optimisation tune-ups , which are less costly and more likely to be welcomed and readily adopted by the energy business .
Furthermore , there is much room for improvements in fuel to energy efficiency; with innovation towards developing upgrades for conventional generators to better utilise the usual energy lost as heat , the amount of fuel needed and therefore greenhouse gas emissions could see a decrease of upwards of 20 percent .
The solution to the need of an environmentally friendlier way to generate energy based on my particular set of factors is therefore to innovate for an add-on to existing power generators to provide greater efficiency of fuel to energy conversion .
This will reduce the greenhouse emissions as smaller amounts of fuel would be needed to generate the same amount of energy , thus meeting our need .
The ubiquitous gasoline cars we have around the world nowadays are being slowly replaced by the electric-powered cars .
In fact , U .S President Barack Obama is aiming to put a million electric vehicles on the roads by 2015 (Peter , 2009) and with the world's number one superpower taking the lead , it is almost as sure that the rest of the world will jump on the bandwagon .
These battery-powered cars were previously a costly mode of transport limited to a niche market but they have since been reborn and are creating a new wave in the automobile market .
The rebirth of the electric vehicle technology can be attributed to the revived interest by the automobile giants , government regulations on greenhouse gas emission and also the improvement in the technicalities previously assosciated with electric cars .
This year , the US Department of Energy , after a highly competitive application process , handed out US$400 million in grants to the 'Big Three' - Chrysler , Ford and General Motors to develop next-generation technologies for electric vehicles (Elie , 2009) .
The vote of trust as shown by the Big Three's initiative in developing this technology has provided a huge boost to the viability of electric cars replacing gasoline vehicles as the main mode of transport on the roads .
Together with the strong backing of the government , it is exactly the type of stimulus that the electric vehicles require in order to make a strong and sustained headway into the automobile industry .
The global push towards the adoption of the electric vehicle technology is increasing in tempo .
However , for it to replace the gasoline vehicles will be an uphill task that requires a concerted effort from both the industry and governments .
Hybrid vehicles available on the roads nowadays are a good start , and hopefully in years to come , gasoline cars will be a thing of the past .
In Singapore , moving on to the commercialization stage of the design process is not easily achieved without going through tough brain storming .
There are many factors to consider in order for decisions to be made .
Thus , problems (may) arise and hinder the commercialization stage of the design process .
First of all , for the NUS eco-car innovation process , it is true that the development of eco-car is indeed environmental friendly .
It does save the Earth with its advanced technology of bringing upon "green" effects , which will be welcomed by everyone .
However , if eco-car is to proceed on with the commercialization stage in the engineering design process , the problem encountered by my home country is the capital cost .
This is because most of the parts contributed to the assembly of the eco car are bought from overseas and these better grade materials can be rare source and hard to acquire .
Furthermore , hiring skilled workers and buying machine to assemble car are costly as well .
Hence , for the eco-car to be launched in Singapore in its commercialization stage of the design process , the production of car will result in significantly increased in cost of retail price due to the high prices of raw materials in constructing of car .
The high retail price of car will significantly affect the decision of committee to commercialize the product as consumer would not pay much for it .
On the other hand , for the NUS Haptic Chair innovation process , the researchers had successfully developed the chair for the convenience of the deaf people in Singapore .
The problem that hampers the design process is the shortage of testers to test on the product , for which according to the article3 that there were not enough deaf children in Singapore to test this product .
Therefore , there will be no guarantee to the effectiveness to see how the product can be utilized and researcher will not be able to do modification and optimization to the chair for better performance .
Research is no doubt one of the key factors that contribute to the success of an innovation .
In Singapore , the research sector is one of the best funded field , besides education and defense .
With a population of only about 4 million , coupled with lack of natural resources , Singapore has no choice but to make the most of what resources are available .
Hence the significance and importance of research in Singapore .
Examples of common problems in the research sector are lack of skilled labour , time constraint and budget .
Take the NUS eco-car project for example which was engineered by NUS and still in the research stage .
It is not fully developed and commercialized yet because of its low market value .
To build an effective eco-car , a pool of skilled labour is needed .
However , in NUS , the project is of student level only .
With additional guidance from experienced engineers , the eco- car could have been better designed at probably have a better chance to be marketed .
The lack of skilled labour in the project caused it to be somewhat stuck at the research stage of the innovation process .
Hence the development of the eco-car was not consumer friendly and it was unable to move on to the commercialization stage .
Maybe it would be take a few more years before the eco-car have a potential to be marketed .
For this NUS FSAE race car , the innovation stops at the development stage as this is a NUS student project .
It will not be taken to the market level .
The success of the design will be based on the yearly race competition held on an international level .
To sum up , lack of skilled labour and inability to re-create computer simulation in real life are not the only 2 problems commonly faced in engineering design process in Singapore .
However , these 2 problems are enough to cause the downfall and failure of the product when placed in the market .
Engineering design processes consists of five different stages starting with defining the problem , followed by gathering pertinent information , generating multiple solutions , analyzing and selecting a solution and finally testing and implementing the solutions .
When solving a design problem , one may encounter problems that will hamper the design process .
In engineering design processes , two of the problems that will hamper the design process would be the lack of funds and resources .
Fund is an important factor that determines whether the design process can be carry on or otherwise .
To begin with the design process , there is a need to have a team of experts and researchers to sphere head the project which requires hiring cost .
Therefore , the lack of fund will result in the inability to hire professionals to accomplish the task .
Fund also plays an important role in purchasing materials to manufacture the product .
Most of the time , products are made over and over again to improve its weaknesses and strengthen its strengths .
Therefore , purchasing of materials can be quite costly as plenty of them will go to waste .
As a result , the lack of fund will hamper the progress of the design process as there is no material to manufacture a physical product to test its usefulness .
The design process does not stop after coming out with a final product .
This is because the product may not be perfect , and minor yet important changes need to be done to improve the product .
Therefore , further research needs to be done and money will be involved .
Without sufficient funds , research to further improve the product cannot be done and this may hamper the design process .
Another main problem that will hamper the engineering design process will be the lack of resources in terms of knowledge , raw material and technology .
Knowledge is very important in engineering design processes .
Without knowledge , one will not be able to make wise decisions during the design process .
For example in the aero plane design process , one needs to determine the material to be use as the body of the aircraft .
Without the knowledge of the characteristics of different materials , one will not be able to choose the best material , which must be strong yet light in weight , to be use .
Knowledge from past experiences will also help in ensuring a smoother design process .
In NUS , a team of students from the engineering faculty took part in Formula SAE Race Car Project in 2001 .
That was the first time engineering students from NUS took part in it .
Due to the fact that it was their first attempt , they realized that the lack of race car knowledge had hampered their design process , which they did not do well for the competition .
However , the engineering faculty has built up the race car knowledge after taking part in several annual competitions , and in the recent competition it came in 19th place .
Therefore , knowledge plays a crucial role in the design process and the lack of it will hamper the design process .
In summary , the flow of the design process can be hampered by the lack of funds and knowledge .
In the case of lacking of funds , companies need to find sponsorships to fund the cost of their design process .
However , knowledge is something that cannot be achieve overnight .
Having past experiences and studies will be the key to gain greater knowledge .
As a living being , maintaining a welfare life is of vital importance .
In fact , whether one can keep leading a high quality life largely depends on a reliable energy supply .
To illustrate it simply , one current need of modern people is the demand for a consistent energy source .
Therefore , engineering design process aims to invent a technology approach to meet people's need .
By identifying the problem and listing all the possible resolutions , it will figure out the best energy source and try to utilize it to supply energy .
After that , gradual improvements will make it more practical , which subsequently serve the public better .
It is known that we all live in a new era where every social activity or industry production activity we do is closely relevant to energy utilization .
Sometimes when the electricity power is cut off temporarily , or the price of petrol is raised rapidly , we will find that our lives are severely affected .
Hence , demand for effective energy supply is the major need of modern people .
The following step is to consider all possible new energy supply source and selecting the best one .
According to reliable research , the new energy supplies include nuclear energy , solar energy , and geothermal energy (Wikipedia) .
Their advantage mainly embodies in respect that they are all renewable energy source .
Among them , solar energy is the best choice because it is safer than nuclear energy and easier to be obtained than geothermal energy .
Hence , solar energy comes into our sights as an ideal energy source .
After that , engineering design process applies the engineering theorem and latest technology to practice , which amounts to effectively use solar energy .
For example , solar energy can be used to heat the bath water .
The whole process is like installing a solar penal containing many tubes on the roof of the house where the penal can be maximally exposes to the sunlight .
Then let the bath water flows through the tubes and absorbs the heat collected by the tubes .
Through heat transfer from tube to the water , bath water is heated .
Another application of solar energy is relevant to the energy generation .
Wind and falling water are actually different forms of solar energy (Harnessing direct solar energy a progress report , 2006) .
By releasing the energy stored in them , large amount of electricity is generated which can solve the electricity shortage in some regions of the world and give great support to the normal living and production activities .
Last but not least , the engineering design process still needs gradual improvements to truly meet people's need .
The production cost of solar energy is higher than that of fossil fuel energy , which therefore impedes its popularization .
Hence , how to cut the cost is what engineering designer should consider about in the future , in order to let solar energy be utilized more successfully .
Nowadays , people have been more health conscious than before .
The need can be seen when they are willing to spend hundreds to thousands of dollars on medical bills .
Challenges have been faced by doctors , drug researches and biomedical engineers to collaborate in this matter in order to come out with the best solution to address current health problems .
Example of it is the latest medical device called the IVDD machine (Intervetebral Disc Decompression Therapy) .
It is a device that addresses the problem of lower back pain .
This idea is discover when researchers realize that space travelers were relieved of low back pain and their disc height were actually increased .
This valuable information were used by engineers to develop IVDD to reproduce the same effects on earth .
A design idea can spark out elsewhere .
Other challenge face by design engineers is the availability of technology .
Technology is often the limiting factor when it come to design a sophisticated medical device .
Example of this is the electrosurgical device .
Electrosurgical device was not invented until it was realized that very high frequency of current can actually burn a tissue when the contact point is relatively small .
This idea and discovery has led to the invention of the CUSA Excel System , a device that performs bloodless tissue cutting which is used now in every hospital in Singapore .
Design can also come from the need and request of people .
Social need often has to be addressed by engineers to fulfill the market requirements .
To show an example , in this advancing and fast changing society , many working adult especially women has found extremely difficult to achieve a balanced between their family and work .
Engineers have addressed this problem with an effective solution by designing the milk pump .
The milk pump allows milk storage and feeding without the present of the mother allowing them to go to work without worrying to breast feed their baby .
It is very interesting to see that how engineering ideas can come about .
There is hundred of ways that an idea can originate from .
A design can come out in order to improve the older design such as the MRI machine , to address psychological problem of patient such as the fear of going through surgical operation or to assist medical personnel such as doctors to deliver better health service .
Other challenges face by engineers including patenting their designs , devices testing , performance benchmarking , training of medical personnel , custom modification of devices , law's requirements , safety concerns , compatibility with other medical devices  ,durability and usability  .
The challenges face is never ending for an engineer in order to come out with a state-of-the-art medical devices currently and also in the future .
When you are enjoying ice-cream in a sweltering summer , have you ever thought about that you are enjoying the privilege for rich people roughly 100 years ago ?
For your information , refrigerator is a rather new invention , and it is not widely used among common household until 1930s (Bowden & Offer , 1994) .
Then how does refrigerator come into being ?
Some factors such as the demand of lead user , economic factors , and environmental concern actually play important roles in shaping refrigerator into its shape today .
In the first place , the lead user of refrigerator is the first and most important factor that drives the development of refrigerator .
Lead user can be defined as a group of people that have the greatest need towards a potential invention .
According to Hippel (cited by Rogers , 2003) , lead user plays an important role in most of the innovation-designing process , because they usually have the needs of innovations that are "well ahead of the general market" .
In the case of refrigerator , lead user can be regarded as the food businessmen in 20th century , mainly because most food would perish very fast under normal temperature .
In addition , long distance transportation of food also requires low temperature to preserve the food .
Since the lead user has such a great need on a product that could help them keep the food cool easily , refrigerator was first commercially introduced to long distance food transportation in 1900s (Bowden & Offer , 1994) .
Lead user therefore started the application of refrigerator on business .
Last but not least , the environmental concern also helps to shape the refrigerator during its innovation-development process .
For example , one of the reasons why refrigerator was not widely used by common household before 1930s is because the refrigerator at that time was using toxic-gas system , which would destroy the environment and be unsafe for home use .
What is more , the environmental concern has become more and more important in the development of refrigerator in the past decades .
One of the most popular refrigerants for refrigerator , Tetrafluoroethane , has been banned by the governments in a lot of countries , taking its depletion to the ozone layer into concern .
The environmental concern therefore leads the refrigerator develop in a more environmental-friendly direction .
In conclusion , in its innovation-development process , refrigerator is mainly shaped by the demand of food businessmen , as well as the economic factors and environmental concern .
Due to the number of words limited , this essay only scratches the surface of what leads to the invention and diffusion of the refrigerator , and picks out the three most obvious factors to discuss .
If you want to do more in-depth research on it , please go through the related journals and websites .
As the global economy continues its search for growth , its insatiable appetite for energy has greatly diminished our non-renewable resources .
Scientists have estimated that given the current global energy consumption , we only have sufficient oil reserves to last us for another 50 years .
Furthermore , greenhouse emissions produced from the burning of fossil fuels have lead to global warming , with its impact visible from the shrinkage of polar ice caps at the Arctic region as well as the rise in global temperature .
This could eventually cause flooding of low lying areas as well as food shortages and it paints a bleak picture for our future generation .
Therefore , the world is turning its head towards 'green' technology as a solution to the above crisis .
Research on the 'green' technology field has started way back in early 1950s , however it has only started to gain momentum recently as its economic and social benefits become more recognised .
With oil prices steadily climbing towards US$100 per barrel , business cost also rises with rising energy cost .
This would lead to price inflation and could cause an economic slowdown as affordability would be a concern .
Furthermore , if no other alternative energy sources are discovered , we could face severe economic problems when we eventually run out of oil , since we need energy to run our economy .
Investing in 'green' technology would not only ensure that we will have a steady supply of energy to develop our economy but it could also be another source of revenue for countries developing such technologies and some analysts has estimated that this industry could potentially be worth up to US$4 trillion .
Therefore , governments are pouring funds into research on this field to benefit from its economic advantages .
Next , there is a general consensus that global warming has been greatly attributed by the rise of greenhouse emission from the burning of fossil fuels , which could have devastating and irreversible impacts .
Recently , rising temperature has been causing frequent heat waves across Europe which has killed a number of people .
The rising temperature also gave rise to an increase in the number of heat stroke cases and could cause a potential health issue .
Furthermore , rising temperature also resulted in frequent droughts which caused food shortages and aggravate the world 'hunger' problem .
More significantly , the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers could endanger low lying areas and the rise in temperature could also cause severe imbalances in our delicate ecosystem .
This will impact all walks of life , including us , humans .
The world environmental system is now balanced on a crucial tipping point beyond which costly , devastating and irreversible impacts will be inevitable .
Therefore , the future of our planet lies in our hands and we must be socially responsible for our future generation .
Thus , environmental groups have been pressuring businesses and governments for 'green' energy solutions as we thread our economic progress with sustainability .
On top of that , governments have also been pushing for the 'green' agenda .
This is evident from the carbon tax law that has been imposed by European Union on businesses , which tax businesses on the amount of carbon they produced .
Furthermore , government are also awarding incentives for companies to go 'green' and more research funds have been allocated to this new field to develop 'green' products .
This is evident from President Obama's economic plan , which includes a US$ 1 trillion package invested into the 'green' industry so that 'greener' products can be developed to ensure economic sustainability .
'Green' technology maybe the main focus in this century , however it must be noted that investing in this technology is costly and not many businesses are willing to venture into it on its own .
Therefore , scientists , businessmen and governments must work together to find a feasible solution in balancing economic growth with sustainability .
In the age of information technology and globalization , the world we live today have progressed beyond our imagination by the aid of constant improvement in technology by research and development (R&D) as well as innovation .
In one of the Rogers's article in 'Diffusion of Innovations' (2003) , he has mentioned about the introduction of battery technology in the electric vehicle by General Motors (GM) in the early 1990s .
Interestedly , this significant technology was initially determined by the California and Arizona state governments inadvertently so as to tackle the issue of smog levels in Los Angeles and Phoenix at that period of time .
(Rogers , 2003) 'IMPACT' , which was renamed as EV , was the pioneer name of the electric car produced by GM (Rogers , 2003) .
With the development of the electric car , the technological innovation has been continuously influenced by several factors primarily in the aspect of environmental and human factor .
Issues pertaining to environmental degradation have already begun to dominate discussions among the world leaders as well as the general population since the early 1990s .
As mentioned by Rogers (2003) , environmental factor is one of the primary issues that led to the production of the electric cars .
Electric cars were created to eradicate the ramifications caused by emissions of carbon dioxide and the smog level in the world .
According to Tyler (2009) , the Ontario Medical Association announced that smog is responsible for an estimated 9 ,500 premature deaths in the province each year .
Hence , it will be beneficial for the creation of the electric cars in the hope of reducing the number of deaths caused by smog .
Furthermore , leaded petrol has been commonly used by the cars consumers in the past .
Depending on the methods used for generating of electricity in electric cars , they have the capability of producing very low emission of carbon dioxide .
It will be possible when more nature energy such as wind and water is used to generate electricity by the turbines compared to the burning of fossil fuels by the power plants .
Thus , with the creation of battery technology generated by electricity , mankind can place greater confidence in new technology to combat environmental issues .
Furthermore , we can not deny the fact that human factor has played a major role in changing the technological innovation of electric car .
Rogers (2003) has pointed out the power in buying interest of test drivers of the electric cars and marketing strategy by GM to create a greater attention on their electric vehicles .
In the article 'Electric cars: On the road to greener transport ?'
(2009) , it discussed about the growing appreciation of the impact that city and regional authorities can have in making practical preparations for an electrified road transport system .
Clearly , the need of the consumers and the government actions are factors that will influence the success and improvement for those technological companies in terms of capital and avenues as well as confidence and morale of the products they sold .
Without the hunger of the unlimited needs in consumers today , technology will not be moving in such a fast pace and may be hampered by the lack of innovation from a lower demand in researchers and engineers .
The process of engineering and designing a new innovation is normally a long and difficult one .
During the process , creative ideas and inventions are brought up and developed upon .
The final product of such a process is usually something that meets the human needs that were first identified and helps make life easier for us .
However , during such a tedious process , there are bound to be problems that may hamper the whole engineering design process .
In Singapore , our small population and education system are two of the main reasons for delays in the process .
Singapore is the smallest nation in Southeast Asia , covering just over 270 square miles and with a population of roughly 4 .7million .
As compared with other innovation powerhouses , for example Japan; which has about 128 million people , Singapore has a very small population .
This lead to factors such as , a limited pool of local talents , a small local market and a lack of volunteers willing to try out new innovations; all of which will affect the engineering design process .
Researching and developing a new product requires a dedicated team of talented researchers with different expertises .
Therefore , in Singapore , it is often difficult to gather such a team due to our small population , which means a smaller group of local talents .
As a result , smaller teams are formed and it inevitably increases the time spent on the whole process .
Furthermore , there could also be a lack of design ideas .
The Singapore government is well aware of this problem and has been trying to attract foreign talents to fill the void .
According to Khandani (2005) , "The net result or purpose of most engineering designs is to produce a product that generates a profit for the company ."
Thus , if there is only a small local market to sell the product , a lot of extra effort will have to be placed to ensure that the final product sells .
The engineering design process will be further delayed because of this extra effort required .
The final effect of having a small population in Singapore is the lack of volunteers willing to try out new innovations .
This is further pointed out in the case of the Haptic Chair (Chua 2009) developed by Suranga Nanayakkara , a PhD student from National University of Singapore .
Mr Nanayakkara had to bring the Haptic Chair back to Sri Lanka for testing because he could not get access to enough deaf children in Singapore .
The lack of testers in Singapore will hamper the fifth step of the engineering design process stated by Khandani , which is the testing and implementation of the solution .
The second problem that affects the process is the education system in Singapore .
The system is successful in educating the masses and is highly regarded by many other countries .
It emphasis mainly on academic performances and students are graded based on their exams .
As a result , there is usually lack of creativity in the students produced through this system .
The impact of having a lack of creativity during the engineering design process is severe as the process requires the generation of multiple solutions .
A workforce that is educated in Singapore will probably suffer as they are not used to answering design questions while they are studying .
Therefore , the process will most likely be hampered due to the lack of creativity in our workforce .
In conclusion , the Singapore government should continue their efforts to bring in more foreign talents and improve the current education system .
Companies should try and promote their local products to other markets and Singaporeans should be more accepting towards new innovations .
All this will lead to Singapore having a greater success in creating new innovations .
In order to handle the energy crisis , the research and development of hydrogen energy is an important section .
How to store hydrogen safely is one of the difficult points among this section , so it should be given priority .
Engineers' innovative design makes contribution to solving such storage issue .
According to Khandani(2005) , engineering design process play an important role .
Because of hydrogen's unique physical property , there are three main problems need to work out .
First , it takes up too much more space for its lightweight .
Second , it escapes too fast .
Third , it is too dangerous for it's inflammably and explosively .
On the one hand , to storage hydrogen under pressure is a rather well-known technique .
However , the use of hydrogen tanks in vehicles , and in particular the challenge of using very high pressures , require advanced technology .
It needs to overcome permeation problem and pass cycling tests .
On the other hand , for solid-state hydrogen storage , it requires materials that can absorb hydrogen quickly and massively .
Furthermore , there are also certain requirements for their reaction .
Overall , these two solutions have their own advantages in different aspects; at the same time , they also have difficulties respectively .
So as to make these two hydrogen storage schemes feasible , a lot of experiments and tests have been done .
For the compressed hydrogen storage , many numerical modeling has been done through computational fluid dynamics tools .
It helps to better under the safety implications of potential accident situations .
And the experiment results came out as well .
For the cycling tests , the filling time is less than 3 minutes and the maximum pressure is 350 bar (will be increased to 700 bar in the near future) .
For the permeation tests , tanks are filled up to 700 bar and the temperatures of ambient and tanks can be controlled up to at least 85c .
For the solid-state hydrogen storage , many testing and performance assessment of potential hydrogen storage materials have been done in laboratory .
Big progress has been made in this field , some new materials have been found and more waiting to be found .
Certain laboratory in European also offers services for research centers and university groups , so as to training and aspiring young .
To sum up , the research and development of the storage of hydrogen will meet human's need and make great contribution for human's getting forward; and the engineering design progress plays important part in it .
Technology is the design or creation of an instrument or an action that lowers the uncertainty in the relationship of cause-effect in achieving a desired outcome .
Many technological innovations were created from scientific researches to solve problems but some were serendipitously invented .
Technological innovations created from scientific researching are created to satisfy a need of to solve a problem affecting people .
Serendipitously created innovations are actually spin-offs from the original plan of research .
Thus an innovation that does not solve the initial targeted problem but solved an unintended problem or need .
Although they had very different outcome , they were triggered by the same motivation to make a better world .
Birth of these two types of innovations had very similar causes , such as pressure from the society or government to cater to certain needs .
Two pieces of technology , for instance , eco-cars and warfarin were products of research and serendipity respectively .
The creation of eco-cars was to address to environmental issues such as global warming and air pollution .
In the early 1990s , the California and Arizona state government demanded that at least ten percent of the total sales of automobile would have to be environmentally friendly .
This resulted in an automobile giant , General Motors (GM) , dedicating $2billion into producing electric cars .
(E .M .Rogers , 2003) This is a case where an innovation is created to cater to the needs by scientific research .
Innovations , regardless serendipity or not , have a common motivation which is to solve surfacing problems in the world .
Electric cars and warfarin alike , they need to be marketed and diffused for potential users to adapt .
Electric cars were marketed extensively through a word-of-mouth process (E .M .Rogers , 2003) arousing a great interest in electric cars .
Also , warfarin was liscenced by Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF) to commercial manufacturer and then used by farmers to eradicate rats where its effectiveness is readily observed .
Both these innovations need to be well marketed and diffused before it can actually solve any problems .
However , the fate of dedicated researched innovations and serendipitous innovations can differ greatly .
One can be almost certain that a serendipitous product will be put into use without much delay as this product is often discovered by another needy party to solve their problems in the process of the initial research .
On the other hand , products through dedicated researching were monitored by a parent organization .
For example , further development of electric cars was dismissed due to the shift of taste of the market towards the "hybrid" gas- and-electric-powered vehicles .
If this product does not provide a satisfactory amount of benefits to the parent organization , it may be dismissed despite its potential usefulness .
In conclusion , innovations are to make life of its user to improve .
No matter how the innovations come about , they have a common sense of motivation .
Through investigation of needs and problems , innovations are made accordingly but unexpected discovery of ideas will lead to innovations of a different kind .
These different kinds will face different circumstances thus a different fate .
Innovations however profitable should not be dismissed but sell to a higher platform where it could spark other ideas or satisfy needs that are not foreseen by the parent organization .
Technology has played a significant role in moulding our lives .
As long as we seek to improve our lives , technology will always exist .
However , this is a period of time where technology will be important in helping mankind to survive on this planet .
Global warming has been identified as one of the greatest threat to our survival , and engineers have tried to solve this issue by coming up with green technology such as solar panels , windmills and dams .
This is a case of technology being socially determined , but modifications in the form of economic factors , military demands and government regulations have occurred , which prevents this technology from being utilised fully .
One of the top priorities of every country on this planet is to ensure the stability of their economy .
For that matter , the use of green technology is not feasible in every country .
Take for example , a country like Singapore , where there are no natural resources available and land-space constraints are always a problem .
Imagine using solar panels to provide electricity for every household .
Given the fact that most households in Singapore share a common block , if the solar panels are fixed on the top of the buildings , will there be enough to provide sufficient electricity for the whole block , which may consists of up to eighty household users .
Given the land constraints , it is definitely a costly as well as non-feasible innovation and only time will tell if this technology can be upgraded into something that can be fitted into a society like Singapore .
Economic factors and government regulations are closely related .
Based on the Madrid article , (Madrid (1995) Diagnosing climate change) John Houghton joked with the leader of Saudi Arabia's delegate party that what he was proposing was against his country's interest , and that he should not be raising it instead .
As we all know , Saudi Arabia's source of income is mainly from the oil industry .
If households all over the world started converting to green technology , there will be a decrease in demand for fuel(since it runs the electricity needed for each household) and as a result a decrease in their countries economy .
This is a case where a country is willing to put aside government priorities for the greater issue on hand , by supporting the use of green technology .
In a bid to counter the issue of global warming , solutions that are socially determined such as solar panels , windmills and dams were created .
Yet the use of it has been restricted by economic factors , military demands as well as government regulations .
Should the day arrive when innovations can be clear of such restriction , only then will the full benefits of it be felt .
In the recent few decades , adverse climate changes and increase numbers of natural disasters have finally made humans realize the impact of human activities on earth .
This ignited a chain of campaigns , activist groups and policies in support of reducing pollutions and wastes to save our planet .
This current situation may seems favorable theoretically for innovations such as the electric car industries to flourish .
However , in reality , the development process of environmental friendly electric cars depends mainly on government policies , social acceptance and cooperation with other related industries .
Decisions made by any industries or citizens in a country is heavily influenced by the policies made by the government .
In the early 1990 , the support given by the California and Arizona state governments on electric cars manages to boost sales of electric cars made by General Motors (Rogers , 2003) .
Besides giving financial aid to R&D departments which helps to initiate the start of the project on electric cars , subsides and incentive may also be given to citizens who use electric cars which would increase the demand for more electric cars .
Such increase in demand would result in companies to increase the supply of electric cars and probably trigger new companies to enter the electric car market .
Thus this increases the rate of development in electric cars .
In conjunction with incentives for electric cars , taxes on pollution inducing cars can also be increased which will motivate people to choose electric cars over petrol cars .
These factors induced by governments decisions truly showed the instigation it has on industries and consumers alike .
Besides government influence , the survival of a new technology also depends on social acceptance of the new product .
In the case of the IMPACT electric cars , the opinion leaders were the ones who stimulated the sales and awareness of these cars (Rogers , 2003) .
Many scientific articles also states that social acceptance is increasingly being recognized as a constraining factor in innovations based on renewable energy sources (Rolf , 2006) .
Without the accession from the society , it would be difficult for the emergent of any new innovations .
This is one of the reasons why marketing strategies such as the use of promotions and advertisements is extremely important in rising the awareness and creating a need for new technologies , thus allowing a new technology to survive .
On the contrary , cooperation between other industries can be equally as important .
For example , if no power supply company is willing to build charging stations for electric cars , it would be impossible for electric cars to exist .
Similarly , if all current gas stations are installed with fast battery charging equipment , electric cars would be more practical and be allowed to travel freely .
Besides the need for electric car companies to work well with their power suppliers , it would be practical for them to work hand in hand with banks and insurance sectors .
An attractive loan and insurance scheme is substantial as it will allow potential customers to buy an electric car , which can have a hefty price tag .
These examples clearly show the significance of the benefits that cooperation between related industries can have on an emerging technology like the electric car .
Ultimately , it is clearly shown to us that there are many factors that can deduce the rate of development of the electric car .
It is thus important for innovators to gain their government's support , get socially accepted and collaborate well with different industries .
In order for electric cars to substitute the current petrol cars , much more have to be done in the mentioned three aspects .
If these factors are not fulfilled , electric cars would still probably ends up as a failed dream .
Engineering design process is the process of coming out with a system to fulfill requirements .
It is a decision-making process , in which the basic sciences , {mathematics}[HYPERLINK: http://en .wikipedia .org/wiki/Mathematics] , and engineering sciences are applied to convert resources optimally to meet a stated objective .
Such engineering designs bring technology together to meet human needs .
One of the many human needs is the security aspect .
Being secure would generally mean the condition of how one feels protected against harm of any sort .
Some examples will be the physical , financial and emotional damage from an event .
The design process comprises the process of defining problems , generating solutions and selecting analyzed solutions , which helps in meeting the need of safety in technology .
In the initial stage , the process allows engineer to identify the needs and subsequently , define the problems involved .
Thereafter , a clear definition of the problem will be reached through the many experiments and data collection done .
For example , in the development of the automobile airbag , potential safety factors contributing to the failure for the inflation of the bags were considered and re-examined throughout the design process .
Also , this is the stage whereby the criteria for the success of the products are considered .
Further emphasis is now placed in meeting the needs initially decided upon , and in this case , the security aspects .
As the stage progresses , multiple solutions are generated to solve the problems defined earlier .
Gathering important information regarding the problem is done initially .
Then , existing solutions to the problems are assessed and combined with other possible solutions to produce better solutions .
This process of tearing and combining is called synthesis .
In relation to the safety aspect , it is through such synthesis that safety will always be improving because better solutions to safety problems are generated .
Finally , it comes down to the decision process of selecting the analyzed solutions .
Selecting of solutions to any of the problems will probably the most difficult stage in the design process .
It starts off with the analysis of every solution generated .
Product safety and liability is one of the analysis factors in determining if the solution is feasible .
This factor is to confirm that using of the design will not cause harm to the users .
For example , one of the questions you will ask yourself frequently is "What are the chances of getting injured during normal use and during the failure of the design ?"
Also , warning labels are introduced to describe the safety guidelines of the design .
Although having warning labels will not keep consumers away from getting injured from the design , it helps in informing them of the potential dangers .
However , there are limitations in the design process in meeting the need of safety .
Firstly , the safety issues discovered were done over the period of century , in the work of thousand of practitioners .
Most of the time , an individual cannot think of all of the safety aspect of a design over few years .
Secondly , generating good solutions to safety issues require creativity and , often , risking safety in the first place to better understand it .
An instance will be the use of animals in the car crash testing before crash dummies were introduced .
Lastly , determining which safety solution is feasible comes with experiences instead of being able to learn it of a book .
Moreover , different teams of engineer may have different point of approach regarding safety issues .
The design process has been the core behind how engineers go about handling new and upcoming problems humanity will face .
It met the many challenges once faced by people and safety is one of the challenges faced .
With better technology and science in the near future , we can definitely expect more from this process in meeting our needs in time to come .
Engineering design is a particular kind of skill that requires an engineer's knowledge and experience .
It is a most effective method to solve the problems we are facing and improve the quality of life .
Engineering design has provided us many conveniences , as tiny as micro-chips in our laptops which have faster processing speed and lower cost , as large as the international transportation .
After we entering the 21st century , our society has come into a new stage with higher productivity and efficiency , which also means that we have more energy requirement at the same time .
For centuries , our major energy came from burning the fossil fuel such as coal , oil and gas .
They have higher quantity of combustion , but they are not reproducible and the resource is limited .
Wood is another energy resource which is reproducible , however , it cannot generate as much heat as fossil fuel , and we destroy the nature also .
According to the Engineering design written by Khandani in 2005 , we can separate the design process into 5 steps .
The first step is to define the problem .
Our problem is very simple----we need more efficient resource to generate enough power for us and last for long time .
At the same time , it must be easy to get and clean , we cannot sacrifice any more .
The second step is to gather the related information .
In a recent research , it shows that traditional resource cannot provide energy for more than 100 years , green house phenomena
becomes more serious .
The new technology gives us many ways to find new source----wave energy , wind energy , solar energy and nuclear energy .
However , in terms of all these sources , they can only provide less than 4% of our power .
That requires engineers to find ways to maximize the efficiency of power generation .
We come to the third step , coming up with multi-solution to the problems .
As we mentioned , they are kinds of new resources to use , solar , wave and nuclear .
We must think about which one is beyond our control and which is better .
We need to follow the step two , analyze all the factors and decide which one we want to choose .
Use nature energy it really good , it is free , it can be found everywhere , such as solar and wind , the bad thing is we don't have the ability to control them .
On sunny day , we have the sun-light , how about rainy or cloudy day ?
In conclusion , engineering process is significant for us .
It applies in our daily life , give more solutions to a same problem .
It supports the society to move faster .
Over the years , we have seen many new technological innovations and inventions .
Some are deem beneficial to mankind , which others are just created for the sake of businessman to reap in business profits .
However , this technological innovation which I am describing has brought about a large change in human life .
It has also brought about much convenience and is now consider an asset to most people .
The technological innovation which I am referring to is the introduction of 3G mobile phones .
In the early 1990s ,mobile phones were first introduced to replace pagers .
Back then , mobile phones could only serve 1 basic function  , and that was just to make basic phone calls .
There was no other functions in a mobile phone .
Apart from being a device with minimal functions , the design and shape of the mobile phone back then was also very ugly .
It was because at that time , the technology was not yet advance enough for manufacturers to come up with cool and sleek designs like the mobile phones nowadays .
It was also very costly to own one .
Hence , not many people were able to afford a mobile phone in the past .
However , take a look at today's society .
Mobile phones have already become a necessity .
Almost everyone owns a mobile phone , including a certain percentage of primary school students .
The phones which people nowadays possess also differs from the past , in terms of functions , design and size .
All these transformation are brought about due to several factors .
Secondly , this technological innovation was brought about by technical improvements in technology .
Over the years , we can see that technology is improving and more people are able to take advantage of it .
Hence , phone manufacturers decided to take a risk by adding a few new features into the mobile phone to see whether is it acceptable in the market .
A typical example is the production of NOKIA 8310 back then in 2002 .
This phone was the first phone in the industry to be equipped with radio function , apart from the basic functions of a phone .
After this production , many other rival brands follow suit .
This thus proves that the society is open and adaptable to new features in the phone .
This was further echoed by the good sales results of this model .
Hence , this thus send a signal to phone manufacturers---the public is more than willing to accept a phone with more functions and will not even mind to replace their previous models for newer ones with added features or functions .
As a result , it give manufacturers incentive to keep up with the times and to always constantly upgrade their mobile phones from point to point .
This is why we are able to see the presence/existence of the 3G mobile phones .
Economic factors also played an important role in this technological innovation .
Over the years , the production of parts for mobile phones has become cheaper .
This could be achieved as manufacturers are able to reap economics of scale as their production size increases .
Hence , as the cost is now lower , manufacturers are then more willing to produce and come up with more features to be added to the mobile phone to attract consumers to purchase it .
This is exactly the case for the production of 3G phones .
People find the 3G phone a useful device as it is able to perform many functions , which inevitably save time and bring about a lot of convenience .
As it has so many functions , it will definitely attract consumers to purchase it .
Since the demand for it is so high , manufacturers will then find it profitable to increase the supply .
This thus lead to the vast production of 3G phones , bringing technology to the next level .
In conclusion , the transformation of mobile phones from a black-grey screen to one that is so highly sophiscated is indeed something remarkable .
This technological innovation cannot be achieved without the factors listed above .
I believe in the near future to come , we are able to expect more innovation and creativity being input in the production of mobile phones .
The society factors such as economic factors , political decision , and technological advancement advertising and even military demands can affects the development of technological innovation .
One very important technology that has been shaped by the society is the development of electric vehicle .
One of the factors that determined and shaped the technological innovation the most is the country economic status .
When people are richer , they will want to own something such as a car to show their social status .
Electric car in the past is very expensive and only the very wealthy people could afford it .
It is a display of social standing when you are seen in an electric car .
Therefore it is more common to see people in cars in those rich countries than those poor countries .
Technological advancement of a country also affects the development of the electric vehicle .
A very important component of the electric vehicle is the battery .
A very powerful battery is needed to powered and run the vehicle for a long time and it is only possible with advance battery technology .
It is only natural that nobody would want an electric car that needs recharging for every few miles it travel .
According to EM Roger (2003) , in the early 1990s , the battery technology can only support the vehicle to travels for 100miles .
For every 100 miles of travelling the vehicle requires 4 hours of recharging to a 220-volt outlet .
Before that the use of electric vehicle was very limited as the battery technology is not available or too costly .
There are many factors that may shape the technological innovation of the technology .
The factors may leave a positive or negative impact on the technological innovation depending on the market and how socially acceptable is the technology at that point of time .
Once such example of a technology that has been shape by it user would be the electric vehicle .
Therefore the society also plays an important role on technological innovation .
People nowadays do not only think of creating tools that can ease their life .
They also need to choose the most efficient technology that can meet their needs .
Furthermore , the processes to create and choose the suitable technology is called engineering design .
One of them is educational problem occurs in every level of academic institution in Indonesia .
The system is not designed to educate students to explore their creativity .
Students are being fed by materials given by the teacher and they are most likely not allowed to learn things in their own way .
For instance , elementary students must follow the step of solving mathematical problems given by the teacher; otherwise they will not get the full score or even considered wrong .
This problem affects the solutions generating process in engineering design .
Since they only have one way to solve an obstacle , they will be fear of problems .
They will not take any risks to find another possibility for the solution of given obstacles .
Khandani (2005) stated that creative people are needed in this stage as they can observe details and in the same time , see the whole picture of the problem .
Based on Khandani (2005) , product safety is an important stage of engineering design , which assures that usage of the design , will not cause any injury to humans .
Khandani (2005) specified that the safety issue can extend to include property and environmental damage .
As we know , recently , there are a lot of fatal accidents have occurred in Indonesia; for example , plane crash and collapsed railway .
Further investigation found out that they were caused by lack of safety and liability test .
They minimize this test because they do not have sufficient fund to support the test .
Living in a society with unprecedented material prosperity , human beings are facing severe problems resulted from energy and resource shortage right now .
In order to sustain a stable development in the next generations , people are paying more and more attention to build up an eco-friendly society which makes energy usage reach an optimum .
Considering the mass energy wastage in transit around the entire globe , one of the approaches to reduce energy usage is to construct a better transportation system that delivers energy more efficiently .
In engineering design processes , the steps regarding solution generation , selection and test are of vital importance to build up such an ideal energy transportation system .
Generating multiple solutions stimulates engineers' creativity and provides impulsion to originate a technological breakthrough .
As Khandani(20005) mentioned in the article "Engineering Design Process" , it is required to investigate the existing solutions , utilize creativity to propose new methods and synthesise all the fresh and ready ideas to come up with a unique and valuable solution .
Such an approach enables engineers to think out of the bounder and challenge the old conventions , and subsequently forges innovative breakthroughs in fields , like transportation system construction , that have hardly experienced any remarkable advancement for decades .
Following the solution generation step , analyzing and selecting a design ensures that the ultimate solution suits best for implementation .
This crucial procedure places all related circumstances into consideration and evaluates the newly-born solutions using a systematic technique (Khandani , 2005) .
Being a project that is closely related to social economy and other critical issues , establishing an efficient energy transportation system urges engineers to identify the overall effectiveness of a certain solution based on the assessment in different fields .
The systematic evaluation approach applied in the engineering design process then facilitates engineers to generate a reliable judgement of the solutions to a large extent .
Lastly , the testing state places the final solution into a real-world practice for further improvement although restrictions exist .
This step allows the solution to be exposed to the real-world variation and yields an even more trustworthy appraisal .
It is also a moment for engineers to investigate the underlying problems in their design and then implement corresponding modification and improvement .
Nevertheless , simulating the real-world variation in accomplishing a huge project like constructing an efficient energy transportation system cannot be fully comprehensive and creating a full-scale prototype of the system is even more unrealistic .
As a result , the effectiveness and some concealed weakness of the design are not able to be fully traced during the test .
To sum up , although imperfection in the accuracy of testing still exists , the solution generating , analyzing and testing steps in engineering design processes play key roles in forging innovative breakthroughs , verifying the feasibility of the design and upgrading the final solution while designing an effective energy transportation system .
Hopefully , the engineering design processes can be further polished in a short term so as to return engineering designs with higher quality .
Throughout the history , many innovations were created not for its intended application .
According to Rogers (2003) , innovation process has six stages: needs/problem , research , development , commercialization , diffusion and adoption , and consequences .
The duration of the process takes many years , or even decades .
Political , social , economic changes during this period would affect the process of innovation .
One of such cases is Global Positioning System (GPS) .
It has evolved from its initial military purposes to the commercialized product that we know today .
Early United States government policy and cold war situation shaped the invention of GPS .
In 1960 , GPS was introduced by US Department of Defense to track down its marine .
Towards its development to today's technology , the policy maker played an important part in it .
In 1973 , when the army , air force , and navy each had its navigation system , the department of defense once again came in and unified the technology .
Furthermore , in 1994 , as the cold war had ended , the US government then decided to fully open the GPS for public use .
The turning point for GPS for civilian use happened at 1983 , when a civilian Korean aircraft was shot down by the Soviet Union for territory trespassing .
It raised needs for a reliable navigation system .
Hence , driven by social concern , President Reagan of the US agreed to partially open the GPS for public use .
Soon after this , when the surveying market boomed in 1980s , the demand for GPS and the money generated also contributes to the development of GPS for civilian use .
In conclusion , political , economic , and social situation normally determine an innovation as shown in GPS .
The GPS would not be possible to be commercialized had the situation was different .
The longer the duration of development , the greater will be the influence of the political , economic , and social situation on it .
Hence , the technology development is partly socially determined .
As modern society is developing fast in the new century , human's need becomes more and more diversified while problems of the shortage of resources get more and more serious .
Such kind of conflict requires engineers to develop new products to meet all needs .
The tasks are never easy for engineers without creativity and innovations; engineers must design products which are both artistic and practical .
Designing products and finding solutions require a long term process , which is defined as engineering design process .
According to Khandani , engineering design process is a very important route for engineers to create products and it can be expressed as a 5-step process , which includes "Define the problem" , "Gather pertinent information" , "Generate multiple solutions" , "Analyze and select a solution" , and "Test and implement the solution" (Khandani , 2005) .
However , there exist some problems that hamper engineering design processes for innovations .
Among them are the problem of plagiarism and the insufficiency of fund support for scientific research .
Although the academic community in my home country is facing many problems hampering innovations , the development of the science and technology has never been pulled down .
I believe that one day all the problems are solved and we get strong enough in academic field .
The main difference between a technology which was developed via research and a technology which resulted from a serendipitous discovery is the extent of the presence of luck .
It is a common knowledge that chance often is a factor in making a discovery (Miller , 1998) .
A serendipitous discovery of technology by its name , suggests that it is an unexpected outcome of a search for solutions to another problem .
It is accidental by nature .
For instance , Dr . Spence Silver , a 3M scientist , intended to produce a super strength adhesive , produced a weak adhesive instead (Connell , 2001) .
This failure was converted into a successful product when a 3M researcher , Art Fry used the bonding agent to create "Post-it" pads (Rogers , 2003) .
On the other hand , a research-based technology is built upon the problem that the inventor has intended to solve .
There is no de-railing of the initial plan .
For example , Tetsuya Mizoguchi saw a need for a portable personal computer in Japan ad invented the first Toshiba laptop computer after several years (Rogers , 2003) .
Comparing the two technologies , it is clear that more elements of luck are present in the former invention than in the latter one .
Nonetheless , luck is not the only determining factor for the birth of a technology , whether it is developed via research or resulted from a serendipitous discovery .
There are other contributing factors such as the efforts of the inventors and their determinations to succeed that lead to the discovery of the technology .
For any technology to be developed , the inventors have to spend a lot of time and effort in their research .
Serendipitous discoveries may be accidental but they are not fortuitous .
They involve a deliberate process of search for a solution to a problem (Cunha , 2005) .
Furthermore , the unanticipated discovery of technology has to be further processed and worked on in order for it to solve another problem .
Dr . Spence Silver spent five years evangelizing the potential benefits of his adhesive invention to internal 3Mers to gain new product development support .
It took another five years for Art Fry to perfect the specifications and design machines to manufacture the product (Connell , 2001) .
Similarly , the inventor of a research-based technology has to conduct multiple purposeful research and overcome numerous challenges before he succeeds .
Mizoguchi invented the first Toshiba laptop computer after several years .
The process of creating the invention was tough as he did not gain the support of the corporate leaders and was denied of development funds and a laptop R&D team (Rogers , 2003) .
Hence for all serendipitous and research-based technologies to be discovered , the inventors have to spend a lot of time and energy in their works .
In addition to the amount of time and energy sacrificed , the inventors must have the perseverance in order to successfully create a technology .
This is an important factor for both research-based and serendipitous technologies .
The inventors are bound to face many obstacles during the process of making their inventions .
For example , 3M leaders showed no interest of the weak adhesive product for nearly five years; however , due to the perseverance and heroic efforts of Silver and Fry , the invention finally gained recognition (Connell , 2001) .
Likewise , Mizoguchi disobeyed the company's orders and risked his career for the sake of innovation-development (Rogers , 2003) .
He believed in his invention and was determined to make it successful .
Both inventors did not give up despite the unfavouring conditions they faced .
Therefore , perseverance is a crucial factor to the discovery of serendipitous and research-based technologies .
In conclusion , whether the technology was created via research or resulted from a serendipitous discovery , the inventor had put in much time and effort into it .
He had to be determined in achieving success as well .
The main difference of the two technologies lies in the element of luck whereby the serendipitous discovery was unforeseen .
Thus the two categories of technologies share many similarities .
Smallpox vaccine was first tested by Jenner in 1796 .
Penicillin was discovered by Fleming in 1928 .
Both of them are important discoveries in medicine .
Hundreds of thousands people are saved by these two discoveries .
There are some similarities as well as differences between these two life-saving discoveries .
Both smallpox vaccine and penicillin are tremendous discoveries that save people's lives and they are milestone in medicine that lead people to explore new areas to fight diseases; however , the procedure of finding these two discoveries and the development of them are different .
One similarity of smallpox vaccine and penicillin is that they are life-saving discoveries in medicine .
In the eighteen century before Jenner discovered smallpox vaccine , smallpox was a widespread killer disease .
Many infants and young children were killed by smallpox at that time .
(Scott , 1996) After Jenner discovered the smallpox vaccine , the death rate of smallpox was close to zero .
Jenner's significant discovery was praised by the third United States Present Thomas Jefferson in his letter 'Letter to Dr . Edward Jenner On is Discovery of the Small Pox Vaccine' .
(Jefferson , 1806) Due to Jenner's discovery , the World Health Assembly officially announced that smallpox was eradicated in 1980 .
(Scott , 1996) Penicillin is an antibiotic that prevent the growth of bacteria and cure infections .
It is the first and most widespread antibiotic to date .
Before penicillin was discovered , many people died of infections .
After penicillin was discovered , the death rate of infection was largely decreased .
During World War II , hundreds of thousands injured people were saved by penicillin .
Another similarity of these two discoveries is that they are landmark in medicine .
Smallpox vaccine is the first vaccine that people used to improve immunity to a certain disease .
After that , people started to develop vaccines to protect people from diseases such as hepatitis B vaccine , BCG and pertussis vaccine .
Similarly , penicillin is the first antibiotic people used to cure infections .
After the discovery of penicillin , people realize that there is a new species of medicine , antibiotic , which can kill bacteria and research are conducted to develop more antibiotics .
More and more antibiotics are discovered and put on production like aureomycin , erycin and chloromycetin .
Both of the two discoveries are milestones that people began to explore new areas to fight diseases .
Although smallpox vaccine and penicillin have those similarities , the procedure and development of these two discoveries are different .
Based on the observation that cowpox prevents smallpox , Jenner began to research into using cowpox to build immunity against smallpox .
After testing his theory , he successfully discovered smallpox vaccine .
(Scott , 1996) In a few years time , his discovery was translated into most European countries languages and smallpox vaccine was applied to prevent smallpox .
In contrast , penicillin is a serendipitous discovery .
Fleming found penicillin almost by accident .
Returned from his holiday to his laboratory in 1928 , Fleming found some penicillium notanum in some lab dishes .
The penicillium notanum can prevent the growth of bacteria .
He named this anti-bacteria chemical penicillin .
(RSC , 2009) However , this discovery was not put on production directly .
Until 1940s , more than ten years after Fleming's discovery , penicillin went into mass production .
In conclusion , smallpox vaccine and penicillin are tremendous discoveries that save numerous people's lives , and they are milestones in medicine .
However , the procedure and development of these two discoveries are different .
In the view of social construction of technology , many technological innovations and inventions are influenced and shaped by social factors (Rogers , 2003) .
Social factors are classified into economic factors , military demands , and government regulations in general .
The values and norms of society significantly influence the process of scientific innovations (Rogers , 2003) .
As illustrated in the article "The Generation of Innovation" (Rogers , 2003) , the process of how the refrigerator got its hum is a typical instance of social construction of technology .
During this process , gas refrigerators with no noise were gradually replaced by electric refrigerators under the influence of social factors .
These factors mainly include the investment of companies , need of customers as well as purpose of saving energy .
First of all , the main reason for this innovation is that the major corporations such as General Electric , General Motors , Kelvinator , and Westinghouse consider that investing in electric refrigerators instead of gas refrigerators would be able to produce more profit (Rogers , 2003) .
Although it was once expected that gas refrigerators would dominate the market , the investment of main corporations has determined the dominant role of electric refrigerators .
In this case , the technological innovation has been driven by the interest of its investors and developed for greater profit for companies .
Furthermore , the evolution of refrigerators is also shaped by the demand of customers .
Refrigerators with better mechanism as well as working capacity are demanded by the market .
The need of customers affected the interests and decisions of investing companies , hence influence the development of refrigerators as well .
In fact , some of the interests of corporations like General Electric are driven by the demand of customers .
What the customers are willing to buy gave rise to the preference of companies .
Production decisions are made to meet the market demand and maximize the profit , and the root of the decisions lies in customers' expectation .
In conclusion , the new generation of refrigerators with no noise is a typical technological innovation which is shaped by social factors .
The decisions by investing corporations , the demand of customers , consideration of energy saving as well as government policies have played important roles in this revolution and the social construction of technology is well reflected .
Many products in the world do not appear from nowhere , but they are made based on the creativity of engineers in the response to human needs .
For instance , the invention of telephone was to help people in long distance communication; airplane was made for shortening travel time; wheel chair enables handicapped to travel around .
Creativity will not stop at one place; it will move on from time to time to improve the appliances or devices .
Therefore , it would be more appropriate now if the engineer design process moves toward human health , in terms of biomedical invention such as artificial heart devices .
Based on Khandani (2005) , there are five phases of design process which will be elaborated in subsequent paragraphs .
The first step of defining the problem is very important so that an engineer would not lost on the way finding the solution .
Therefore , it is necessary to identify the need from this design activity and make a problem statement for the ease of gathering information , choosing a solution and conducting experiment .
In the case of artificial heart devices , materials used and size may be defined as the problems .
With the increasingly globalised world and widespread travelling by people , there is greater mobility .
People can now be travelling to other countries to work .
Hence people also will want greater mobility in their computers , which is why the laptop was invented in the first place .
With the laptop , people can now be working anywhere and anytime , not be chained to their work desks as their desktop computers are not portable at all .
So the companies are competing to develop laptops that are lighter , smaller and pack in more functions and computing power so as to meet consumer demands .
People can now work on the move and be more efficient by multitasking .
But people have unlimited wants , they are not contented with just the laptop with is considered quite bulky at times , thus they demanded laptops that are smaller , lighter .
Just recently , a new class of computing devices emerged .
They are the netbooks .
They are much smaller , lighter than the laptops and can be fitted into small bags comfortably .
They cater to the increasingly mobile workforce with can work anyway on the go as they are able to surf the internet and work on documents .
This functionality comes only at a fraction of the cost and weight of the laptops .
Hence there are people willing to buy the netbooks .
Hence this shows that the consumer factor also influenced the development of laptops to a great extend .
The laptop is indeed an important technology that is shaped by economic and military factors , and consumer demands .
These are the main reasons behind the social forces that shape development of this technology .
Companies will want to create a product that is demanded by the world so as to make profits to survive .
And people's wants and desires are unlimited so as to fuel this continuing development of this technology .
Perhaps the future laptops will shrink to the size of palmtops but with greater computing power as people demanded laptops that can be fitted into their pockets .
According to the article "The History of Electric Vehicles" , Robert Anderson of Scotland invented the first crude electric carriage between 1832 and 1839 .
However , having been popularity for less than 100 years , Electric vehicles had all disappeared by 1935(The History of Electric Vehicles ,2009) .
After 65 years , electric cars came back again from America; however , unfortunately and interestingly , they failed again .
Rogers indicated in his article "The Generation of Innovations" that the innovation-decision process is very crucial to the adoption of a new technology , because not only technique factors but also economic , political and social factors play an important part .
Therefore , it is the technique , economic , political and social factors that killed electric cars together .
Electric cars have a very obvious shortage in their technique design .
The electric cars invented in 1990 did not have a powerful battery .
Due to the limitation of its weigh , size and the battery technology , the battery used in the electric cars at that time was limited to a range of 100 miles (Rogers ,2003) .
As a result , they are not convenient enough .
Instead , Hydrogen fuel cell was brought up to substitute the electric battery .
Economically , the consumers , the car companies and some oil companies were not very satisfied about electric cars .
In order to improve the air condition , consumers had to spend more and compromised on limited range of electric cars .
And since the electric cars did not have engines and some other complements , the car companies could no longer benefit from the maintenances of those cars .
As for the oil companies , apparently , they could not make money from oil , if all the engine cars were substituted by electric cars .
Moreover , the main stream of the government did not approve of this inventor .
Although the California and Arizona state government came up with the mandating that "at least 10 percent of the total sales of automobile companies would have to be nonpolluting"(Rogers ,2003) , they had to cancel the command since the electric vehicles failed to act in the public interest .
Moreover , the federal stepped in this case to oppose the California and Arizona state government .
In the article "The Generations of Innovations" written by E .M . Rogers , social construction of technology is defined as technology that is shaped by social factors .
In this essay , I will use the invention of internet as an example to show how this important technology was determined initially by a specific group of users , mainly government and military personals , and later commercialize into today's daily usage .
Unlike the development of some inventions like Post-its which was resulted from serendipity , the internet was a strategic innovation that was initiated by the government and developed by their researchers .
In order to understand the reasons for the need of Internet by U .S . government , we will need to understand the history background during the middle of twentieth century .
During the Cold War period , the world politics was divided between democracy and communism .
In the 1950s , the Soviet Union tested their first atomic bomb resulting in the world having two nuclear super powers that were conflicting with each other over world political dominance and military superiority .
This inevitably sparks of the arms race .
Meanwhile , the growing dominance of Soviet Union over Eastern Europe also threatened the position of the U .S . as the world's most powerful nation .
A series of policies containing containment and deterrence of the rising influence of communism were implemented .
The Cold War and arms race stimulated the research and development of all technological fields in the U .S . including improving communication infrastructure between the government and military planners .
In 1961 , Paul Baran , who is a member of RAND Corporation , was commissioned by the Department of Defense to do research on networking .
Baran and his colleagues developed an entirely different method of communication called packet switching .
The principle behind packet switching was that data would be broken down into datagrams or packets that were labeled to indicate the origin and the destination of the information .
The packets were then be forwarded from one computer to another computer until the information arrived at its final destination computer .
The packets would be encoded as electrical signals , light , or radio waves and transmit via copper cables , fiber-optic strands and the ether; which consists of microwave , satellite , or radio transmissions .
This was important part of a computer network .
In situations where packets were lost at any given point , the message could be resent by the original user .
As a result of decentralization , packet switching , unlike the telephone system , will not break down when one part of the network systems is faulty since the packets can be rerouted until it arrived at its intended destination .
In order to destroy this decentralize communication system , all the channels of transmission will have to be destroyed .
Three years later , J .C .R .
Licklider , a researcher under Advance Research Project Agency (ARPA) proposed that computers were the keys to network communication .
With the inclusion of computers as a link to network communications , a system of protocol had to be created to standardize network communication .
The interface message processor (IMP) became part of the actual language that linked computers to the network; it defined how they would connect , route and verify the messages received .
Thus the IMPs , together with the telephone lines , and data sets would constitute a 'message-switching network .'
The protocols would define the communications formats between the IMP's and became the format through which all the computers in a network were connected to .
The following two decades witness the improvisation and spread of networking .
Network Control Protocol (NCP) was developed by VInt Cerf and Bob Kahn in 1973 to allow network communication of people using different hardware .
Consequently , networks were able to connect to different parts of the world .
For instance in 1973 , the U .S . has connected its network to both the United Kingdom and Norway .
In the mid 1970s , networks began to spread to research universities across America and internationally .
The governments of France , Japan , Germany and other European nations also developed research networks .
In the early 1980s , there was a growing demand for network usage by researchers and students .
However , it was costly to be part of the ARPANET because ARPANET had a tight control on the usage of network .
The frustrated Duke students Tom Trusscott and James Ellis , and Steve Bellovin , a student at UNC , created Usenet .
Within a few years , there were more postings and news groups than the system could handle .
By 1982 , there were hundreds of postings a day to as many different news groups .
Usenet was much more popular than ARPANET .
Although there were over 230 ARPANET sites in 1982 , Usenet take less than two years to reach that number .
The popularity of Usenet was due to the fact that it was inexpensive and provided semi-anonymous communication through which people could share their ideas .
This resulted in hundreds of discussion groups , each discussing different subjects  , which range from politics to daily life experience .
The explosive growth of network usage resulted in all of the networks to switch from NCP to TCP/IP in 1983 .
The new TCP/IP protocol was able to deal with the increased electronic traffic of the developing Internet .
In 1987 , the National Science Foundation , which has funded a program earlier in 1984 to create national infrastructure to provide a variety of academic institutions access to a larger national academic network , backed away from funding the Internet and allowed giant corporation such as IBM , MCI and Merit Corp to manage and support the infrastructure it had funded .
It was not until 1993 where the Internet was transformed from government-funding to commercialization by private sectors .
With the creation of World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN , the European Nuclear Research Centre , the World Wide Web opened up a new era of individualism and creativity that will change the information age once and for all .
In conclusion , it was the historical background during the era of Cold War that prompted the US government to consider new ways of creating indestructible communication to enable the political and military leaders to communicate with each other during a nuclear attack .
Through the works of brilliant researchers , the Internet , which has limited to a few users at first , was improvised to accommodate increase electronic traffic and finally commercialize to be available to each and individual of us .
Technology is an act of designing and inventing of a tool that will either solve a problem recognized or fulfill a particular human need , in other words it is a product of society .
According to Rogers (2003) , the success of the invention is full of uncertainties as the responses from other parties involved , such as the society or government , are not predictable .
If the product is not accepted by consumers or widely used , the product has failed socially .
There are many factors that contribute to the failure of a product socially and one of them is the economic factor which monopolizes the consumer market .
The case study on Cowan (1985) is a representative example of failure of product due to economic factor , in which a aggressively advertised product is preferred over the other that can bring much more advantages .
Cowan (1985) discussed about the two types of refrigerators developed , the electric refrigerator and the gas refrigerator .
The gas refrigerator should have been more preferred by consumers since it brings along overwhelming advantage but it turned out to be otherwise .
The extensive promotion of the electric refrigerator , which its research and development investment was funded by corporations , influenced the choice of consumers since the gas refrigerator was not widely promoted and made known to consumers .
Such cases are typical examples of how a technological invention is shaped by economic factor , in which the technology made available to the consumer was directed by corporations' profits earned instead of offering the one that benefits consumer most .
One of the reasons behind such situations is probably due to corporations' fear of losing their share of the market and thus suppresses new technology to minimize chances of it happening .
This , however , affects consumer's acceptance of inventions directly , in which the choice made will then be economically driven rather than based on the usefulness of inventions .
Another contributing factor of the success of invention will be the buying power of consumer , which very much depends on the economic situation then .
In times of economic recession , it is of lower tendency for consumer to purchase the more expensive refrigerator when both have the same primary functions that is to store up food at low temperature .
For that , the competition among corporate and the extent of price slashing they are willing to offer such that they still earn an amount of considerable profit may help improve consumer's acceptance of their product .
Therefore , it can be concluded that functionality may not be only determining factor to the success of technology since it may not be the priority of consumer's concern , but rather how the technology is commercialized and diffused to the public or society .
As such , technology nowadays needs not only to prove its functionality but also spend efforts on creating its awareness since it is up to the consumers , who come in contact with many advertisements in their life and is eventually conditioned , to make the decisions .
Due to the flourishing of construction industries over the years , the construction industries worldwide consume resources equivalent to more than what the nature are able to produce on Earth .
In this rate of consumption , our environment will not be able to supply us with sufficient resources years down the road .
In order to compensate and preserve the right of nature , there is a need to implement a system whereby waster construction materials can be treated and re-used .
This implementation will help protect the environment by controlling amount of resources consume; reduce cost of manufacturing and importing of raw materials; reduce the cost of construction and even maximise economy advantages .
The process of recycling of construction waste involves separating and reusing recoverable and useable waster construction materials during demolition .
The advantage of this treatment system not only will produce low-cost recycled materials , it may also produce new composite of materials with better characteristic .
However , few considerations should be taken into account during the design process .
During the remodelling of buildings most construction waste goes into landfill , hence increases burden on the landfill loading .
These wastes may be high in chemical content which result in water and soil pollution .
Whereas some can be recycled and re-use as similar material while others to be reconstituted to other form of usable materials .
Moreover , recycling which need reprocessing may not be economically feasible because it requires a facility using recycled resources to be located near the source .
Thus , site separation is an important step for recycling of construction waste .
Although initially it requires extra effort and training , once separation habits are set up , it can be done at very low cost .
The world today is changing continuously where it faced many global challenges and problems .
As a result , technologies have been constantly developed in order to response to human needs .
Once the needs are identified , ideas have to be developed through research .
Example of such technology is the development of tomato- harvesting machine where an agricultural scientist at the University of California at Daris predicted there will be a serious shortage of the labour in California (Rogers , 2003) .
However , technologies can also be created through serendipitous discovery .
As the name implies , it is a new discovery of a valuable idea by accident .
One example is the discovery of the Penicillin by Sir Alexander Fleming where he realized the presence of the antibacterial agent while researching on influenza .
This leads to the birth of the Penicillin which is widely used as antibiotics (Mary Bellis , About .com) .
Although the two technologies are created in a very different approach , both have to undergo the innovation-development process where the final product can be marketed .
According to Rogers (2003) , the innovationdevelopment process consists of all the decisions , activities , and their impacts that occur from recognition of a need or a problem through research , development , commercialization of an innovation , through diffusion and adoption of the innovation by users to its consequences .
Therefore it is extremely time-consuming to develop a new technology .
For a technology that is deliberately invented , it generally requires much a longer time frame as compared to those fortuitous discoveries .
This is because inventors had to generate multiple solutions to solve for the problem identified .
Much research has to be prepared so that the best solution could be found .
In the case of the tomato harvesting machine , there are plenty of factors that need to be consider .
If the tomatoes have to be harvested by a machine , they have to breed hard tomato varieties so that they will not be crushed .
However in the case of the serendipitous discoveries , identifying a problem or need as well as selecting the best solution are eliminated .
Hence the total time consumed is much shorter compared to the technology develop through research .
However , no matter whether it is created intentionally or unintentionally , both required the ability to think creativity and innovatively as well as some coincidence and luck .
In the case of a deliberate technology , inventors must not restrict themselves to only one solution but exposed themselves to the various possible solutions .
These solutions have to be analyzed and research further until the best solution is found .
If luck is presence with coincidence , the best solution will be generated in a shorter time .
Similarity , the person must have the ability to view things in a different perspective , have sufficient background knowledge about the serendipitous discoveries and some luck for serendipitous discoveries to take place .
Since fortuitous discovery often occurs while research was carried out in a totally unrelated field , they must be able to identify the technology that came by accidentally .
In conclusion , the fundamental of inventing a new technology is to meet the needs of human .
Regardless of how technologies are developed , they will definitely benefit people .
Developing a new technology usually requires plenty of time , therefore creative thinking and innovation is required .
In addition , luck and coincidence must be presence for the discovery to happen at the right time , right place and to the right person .
With all these factors , the time taken to develop a new technology will be shorted .
Rogers (2003) brought forward the idea that society is coming to a generation of innovation , which implicates that innovation is gradually becoming the main tasks of various enterprises and scientific research .
In every day's newspaper , it is usual to find news regarding some enterprise adopting a new technology .
However , the products in market are not updating as fast as the innovation introduced to the public .
This is because the innovation in technology is not only technologically decisive but also socially decisive .
Social factors include economic factors , military demands , government regulations and so on .
Usually , a new technology will be tested by more than one factor and the results will directly affect the future of the new technology .
Firstly , the new technology must satisfy consumer's needs .
Before the refrigerator was introduced to market in a mass , there was a competition between two prototypes of refrigerator .
The old type has a motor that drives a compressor that condenses a liquid , releasing heat into the surrounding environment that the liquid had previously absorbed inside the refrigerator when the liquid vaporized .
A superior alternative is the gas refrigerator , in which the ammonia refrigerant is vaporized by heating it with a gas flame .
Later , the refrigerant dissolves in water , thus cooling the refrigerator box .
The gas refrigerator has no moving parts and hence is unlikely to break down .
Furthermore , the gas type hardly has noise , which solves the most severe problem regarding the noise (Cowan , 1985) .
Because of these overwhelming advantages , people expected that gas refrigerator would dominate the consumer market .
However , it was defeated by electrical refrigerators because of some other factors
The example of refrigerator competition interprets that whether to adopt a new technology depends on other social factors other than consumers' needs .
To continue the previous example , the reason why gas type lost in the competition is due to the high research and development cost , several dominant cooperation thought electrical refrigerators would make more profit , then they invested large amounts of money in producing electrical refrigerator and developing market .
The aggressive occupancy of market compelled smaller companies which prefer producing gas refrigerator give up .
In this way , gas refrigerators were washed out of the market .
Whether a new technology will be popularized usually depends on more than one factor .
Mostly , they will give reverse responses after considering in different angles , but people can still make decisions based on the more crucial factor or the factor they concerned the most .
Apart from consumers' need and producing cost , other factors like environmental problems , military demands and government regulations also affect the adoption of a new technology .
The earth is experiencing water deficit .
Unlike burning forests or volcanic eruptions , the falling of water tables throughout scores of countries cannot be readily photographed , it is largely invisible .
However , in recent years , this are observed by an increasing number of droughts , dried-out wells , and unavoidably , a change in climate pattern across the globe .
We are now consuming water that belongs to the future generations .
The high demands and misuse of water are increasing .
Man has since been working , vastly through engineering efforts , to manage water resources .
According to Khandani (2005) , engineering is the creative process of turning abstract ideas into physical representations (products or systems) .
In the last few years , engineers had indeed innovatively managed and minimized water deficit in many countries by conveying solution ideas into engineering designed products and systems .
Water treatment has largely been classified as one engineering process which turns used-water into clean , acceptable water for end use , and sometime even drinkable water .
Dirty water are usually collected through piping systems from lakes , drains and household , and transported to a treatment plant .
In the treatment plant , the dirty water is separated from solid particles by settling and filtration .
After which they will be treated and purified by various sub-processes such as reverse osmosis , distillation , chemical disinfection and some others .
All of these engineered processes will produce a cleaner effluent .
Further treatment can even turn dirty wastewater into drinkable water .
The 'Newater' treatment plant in Singapore is a global example of water treatment .
Water can be stored , treated and finally even transported .
Water transportation is made possible through engineered piping system .
Large water pipes are constructed to constantly transport water from a storage dam to dried-up lands .
This allows for a good system of irrigation by providing transported water to the dried soil continuously .
This process and system assist in the growing of crops in dry area especially during periods of inadequate rainfall .
With such engineering designs , deserts can be turned into green pastures with rich crops .
It is amazing how science and technology through man's engineering efforts have benefited the world .
We are now facing a crisis of water shortage which could lead to many water related problems .
Engineers in recent years have been working creatively and innovatively to properly treat and managed water .
With the advancement in technology , these are all made possible and there are even purified drinkable water treated from wastewater .
In certain countries , dried-out lands are even brought alive through water irrigation , where water are stored up somewhere and constantly transported through pipes to these lands .
Engineering products and systems designs are not simply a design of aesthetical purposes , but also technologically meeting some of the greatest needs of human , water deficit .
Inventions are made to benefit mankind .
However , some inventions were made accidentally while others look into the problem directly to develop a new product .
From five aspects - discovery , creativeness , time taken , acceptance of the project by company and also from problem solving - we can see that there are similarities and difference in these two approaches .
The examples I am using for this essay for serendipitous discovery and developed via research is 3M Post-it pads and Toshiba Laptop respectively .
One obvious difference is the way it is invented .
One of the well-known accidental inventions , according to E .M . Rogers (1950) , happened several decades ago , 3M researcher found a new bonding agent , but decided it was worthless because it did not stick paper very tightly to a surface .
This failure converted into a successful product when a 3M researcher used the new bonding agent to create "Post-it" .
As for Toshiba laptop is developed via research , Mizoguchi foresee that portable personal computer can be invented when he visit the United States with an R&D team form Toshiba .
He was certain to make it came true .
Creativeness is always one of the important factors in inventing things .
An accidental discovery requires a member of the team to think of the product related during another process of making another product .
This person must be able to think out of the box .
But for Mizoguchi , he has set his target on developing a laptop .
However , both inventions require creative thinking in order to produce excellent product .
We can see from the above , inventing things is not an easy task .
Each of the findings has it difficulties .
Be it serendipity or developed through research inventions , it benefits to human lives .
In the world today , most humans are leading convenient and comfortable lives .
This is made possible due to the innovations engineers have produced to improve on the lives of mankind .
What is the engineering design process that produced so many useful innovations like ?
According to khandani , S .(2005) , engineering design consists of five steps: defining the problem , gathering information , brainstorming for solutions , selecting the best solution and finally the implementation of the solution .
These are the general steps to the formulation of an innovation .
This process requires certain skills from the engineer , such as creativity , ability to learn from failure .
In singapore , the local society and education system produces problems that hinder the usage of the engineering design process .
The first problem will be the focus of the Singapore education system .
It has evolved over the years , from textbook learning to the introduction of hands-on learning to equip students with skills such as creativity .
However , the implementation of hands-on learning is only carried out to a small extent .
learning is still heavily dependent on textbooks today .
In addition , education in singapore is fast paced and result orientated .
From primary schools to junior colleges , lecturers are always rushing through lessons in order to be able to finish the syllabus on time .
Whether students learned or not depends on the outcome of major examinations such as GCE 'O' and 'A' levels .
These exams do not concentrate on the learning process .
Instead , it focuses on the answers .
With such an education system in place , what students learn are confined to what the textbook offers , with minimal development of critical skills such as creativity and analysis .
This trend will impede the engineering design process at the brainstorming and selection of solution stages .
In the brainstorming stage , the innovator must be able to think of solutions that are non-existant in reality .
This requires alot of creativity .
Next , the selection of the best solution requires the innovator to possess strong analytical skills .
These skills are critical to the two stages of the design process , but is lacking in locals due to the effect of the education system .
Another problem faced in singapore is society's mindset .
Life in singapore is highly competitive and fast paced , hence parents believe that their children must possess outstanding paper qualifications to survive .
As a result , they enroll their children in tuition classes to enhance their academic performance , depriving them of the chance to develop their critical skills .
Moreover , majority of the locals are apathetic to their surroundings .
Everyone minds their own business , and do not bother themselves with what happens around them , unless it concerns them .
In the current state of society  , people are not adept at analysing information and observing problems , and even if they did , they will deny its presence .
This behaviour will jeopardise the steps where the problem is defined and the selection of the best solution .
To be able to define a problem , the innovator must be observant enough to see the problem , and bothers to do something to improve it , hence creating an innovation .
The skills are vital to the two stages of the process , therefore society's mindset poses a problem to the design process .
In conclusion , for Singapore to have outstanding innovators , the problems in the education system and the mindset of society must be addressed .
People must be more creative , able to think analytically and change their mindsets .
However , two problems are not the only problems that will impact the design processes negatively .
There are other problems that require attention .
With these problems rectified , then Singapore will have more innovators , and hopefully more useful innovations to improve people's lives .
Global warming is a threat that we are becoming more anxious about .
One of the causes of this environmental degradation is from carbon emissions , especially , carbon emissions emitted from car exhausts .
Hence , the electric vehicle is an important technology as it is a possible alternative and replacement for future cars .
The electric vehicle wins over the petroleum vehicle as it produces less carbon emissions .
Being an environmentally-friendly vehicle , it should be a popular choice .
However , they are poorly adopted and according to Autodata , electric vehicles only make up 2 .8% of today's cars .
Thus , it is likely that the popularity of electric vehicles is socially-determined .
Economic , governmental and psychological factors could have shaped this technological innovation .
One factor that has shaped the electric vehicle is the economics of owning an electric vehicle .
Cost is a major consideration in a consumer's decision-making process .
The maintenance cost when the electric vehicle was first introduced was high .
This made the electric cars more expensive than petrol-run cars .
For instance , the battery pack in typical electric cars did not last long .
According to Gruening (1995) , the battery pack had to be replaced every 20 ,000 to 30 ,000 miles .
Consequently , this made the electric vehicles more expensive than petrol vehicles and hence less affordable to most families on a budget .
Besides the low lifespan of the batteries , the time required to recharge an electric vehicle was much longer than the time required to refuel a fuel tank .
For many , time wasted waiting would translate to high opportunity cost .
Thus , these economic factors could be reasons why electric vehicles were poorly adopted .
Besides economic factors , government regulations and laws also played a part in shaping the electric vehicles .
The California and Arizona state governments , in the 1990s , mandated that at least 10 percent of the total sales of automobile companies would have to be non-polluting .
Rogers(2003) notes that these laws prompted General Motors to invest in the designing , manufacturing and marketing of the electric vehicle .
As a result , the concept of the electric car was widely promoted in the United States of America .
In addition , tax rebates and incentives added on the attractiveness of buying an electric vehicle .
For example , the Climate Change Bill in the United States included incentives to set up charging stations and subsidies for people buying the cars .
These offer made by the government made these vehicles competitive to the petroleum cars in prices .
Therefore , it can be seen that the government's involvement in promoting environmentally-friendly vehicles affected how marketable electric vehicles are .
Moreover , psychological factors of owning an electric vehicle have affected the outcome of the electric vehicles in the market .
A technical limitation of the electric vehicle the range of travel it can offer .
An electric vehicle with a fully-charged battery is not able to travel as far as a petroleum vehicle with a fully-filled fuel tank .
Although families who needed a car as a mode of transport did not usually require traveling for long distances , there is a psychological perception of having their freedom being restricted .
Hence , they will prefer a petroleum car which has a potential in allowing them to travel farther .
Thus , the strong desire for freedom might have affected the popularity of the electric car .
In short , there are several factors that could have shaped the electric vehicles .
Economic and psychological factors might have dissuaded many from supporting them while the government plays a prominent role in encouraging the growth of the electric vehicle industry .
However , there is a close relationship between the social factors and the technical challenges that the electric vehicles face .
Hence , the recognition of electric vehicles by society could be affected by both social factors and challenges faced in the present technology of the electric vehicle .
As Khandani(2005) points out , innovations are designed to meet human needs .
Human needs and problems are the motivation of conceiving of new ideas and designing new products .
In Singapore , and other countries next to the equator , air conditioners and electric fans have greatly contributed to people's life and people are able to enjoy cool and refreshing in burning hot days .
Throughout human history , people have conceived of many ways to get rid of heat in hot weather .
The design process of electric fans and air conditioners is a process in which engineers make designs to meet people's needs .
From the very primary fan to the electric fan , and all the way to the air conditioner , engineering designs gradually solve the problem and meet people's needs .
In ancient time , heat and humidity tortured people a lot .
In hot days , people felt physically uncomfortable and mentally irritable .
The working efficacy was low and diseases transmitted easily .
People began to think of ways to solve the problem .
Some great minds , probably the engineers in those days , created fans .
Fans were generally made by leathers or palm leaves sewed together .
The fan basically combined the theory of flowing air and wind , but it was a great success and everybody uses fans to generate breeze and keep cool in summer .
It relieves the discomfort in summer .
http://www .iisme .org/etp/HS%20Engineering-%20Engineering .pdf
Gradually , people were not satisfied by fans , since they had to keep shaking fans to keep cool .
It was disturbing to shaking a fan at work or in sleep .
At the same time , electricity was invented and people began to appreciate the convenience brought by it .
In 1886 , Schulyer Wheeler (Inventors , 2009) devised a new type of machine using electricity to send breeze .
After careful design and hard process of trials and fails , the first electric fan was created .
The advent of electric fan was a great success and it was implemented around the world .
People's need was met by the air vortex flow formed automatically .
The electric fan was the standard at that time .
Now electric fans and air conditioners are better designed than the original ones .
People feel more comfortable in hot days .
Productivity is increased and industries flourish .
The design was initiated by people's needs , and they ultimately met people's needs .
It is believed that the design will not end there so that more advanced products will appear .
More developed and enhanced functions will be added and improve people's life better and better .

Technology innovation is significant to the world .
Without it , our society could not have progressed , nor would our life become convenient .
According to Roster (2003) , technology innovation development is a process begins with recognition of a problem or need , which arouses research and development activities designed to create an innovation to solve the problem or need .
Five stages can describe this process: problem , research , development , commercialization diffusion and consequences (Roster , 2003) .
While , different countries have different way to perform these stages .
So during the process , they encounter different obstacles , such as political issues , financial issues .
In China , currently two factors which are education system and economic situation that hamper the technology innovation process severely .
Look around and you would most probably notice people driving in their cars , talking on their phones or busy typing away on their personal computers .
These occurrences may seem common now , but they were definitely not in the early 1900s .
The advancement of technology over the last century was so breathtaking that one often wonders how the technologies were invented .
Were they created conventionally , which means that the general public knows about their development , or were they secretly developed in a skunkworks environment ?
Regardless of their distinctions , both technologies share similarities that make each of them unique and useful in their own ways .
The most significant contrast between the skunkworks technology and that of the conventional method is the vastly different confidential levels and aims which each technology works on .
In the case of skunkworks , the product being developed is known only to the researchers and the relevant organizations .
This ensures that the probability of information leakage regarding the product is kept to a minimum , so that the main objective of creating the product can be realized .
For example , Lockheed's P-80 Shooting Star fighter jet , which was designed and built under the knowledge of only the researchers and the United States military , helped the US overcome the technology gap which Germany had over it during World War 2 .
On the other hand , corporations using conventionally generated technologies usually announce to the public their latest updates pertaining to their most recent creations .
The release of information is usually done by companies which wanted to flaunt their superiority over other similar companies competing in the same market .
The rivalry between Sony and Microsoft over the gaming console industry leads to both companies constantly improving their products and announcing it to the world so as to apply pressure on the other .
Thus , it can be seen that differing degrees of secrecy for disparate technologies stems from dissimilar aims .
Another difference between the two technologies is the impact that they create when both are in operation .
New innovations contrived in skunkworks environment usually revolutionize the world and propel the company which invented it to new heights while that is not the case for conventional technology .
The invention of personal computers in IBM's skunkworks completely changed the way in which the world operates , and made IBM the forerunner in computers , but the upgrading of the computers with ordinary technical knowledge did not really lead people onto a new path , instead it only results in the proliferation of many small computer-based companies .
As a result , the market is now full of computers with different brands .
This maybe the unexpected positive side effect of using conventional technology , but compared to the skunkworks , it is relatively insignificant .
Despite of the differences , both technologies share some common traits .
First , both require a high level of accuracy .
There is not much room for error in both cases , as a slight mistake may result in devastating effects .
The skunkworks-produced P-80 fighter jet experienced numerous crashes , which resulted in many deaths , due to problems which were not analyzed accurately .
Similarly , the HIV vaccine was not researched adequately , causing many volunteers to contract the virus unwillingly .
Second , products that emerge from both technologies can be used for a long time .
It is important as this means that resources can be channeled to other areas of research .
Using the previous examples , the P-80 jet was used for close to 30 years before being replaced completely , while the HIV vaccine may be in use forever if the vaccine undergoes successful researches .
It is through these similarities that people can compare and advance on the current technology .
To sum it up , the major differences between skunkworks and conventional technology is the ripples which both technologies produce and the secrecy in which they are required to observe .
These are features that make each technology unique in its own way .
However , both technologies also possess similarities like the stringent levels of accuracy and the lifespan of the products generated , which shows that features can be adopted by more than one form of technology as long as it is beneficial .
Having a home is one of the most fundamental human needs .
Be it a shelter or a big house , everyone has to have a place they can call home .
Despite being a fundamental need , there are many people in the world who are unable to have a proper home .
According to the UN Human Settlements Programme , there are around a billion people out there who live in overcrowded housing with poor water quality , lack of sanitation , and no garbage collection .
With rapid urbanization and the world population increasing into the future , housing would prove to be a challenging issue .
A proper housing system has to be set up to deal with these housing issues and the best way to develop such a system would be using an engineering design process .
The main steps to consider in a good and proper housing system are the affordability , durability and safe living conditions .
Hence the main solution to the problem of improper housing would be the reduction of housing cost without compromising on quality .
Homeless people suffering from housing issues are mainly attributed to problems of affordability .
Building proper houses or flats usually require much finance .
The construction cost bundled with the raw materials for building many homes is something , which the poor cannot afford .
Furthermore , developers have no incentive to carry out projects in these less developed countries , as there is just no market to earn profit from .
The problem of cost clearly creates more homeless people .
On being unable to obtain a proper home , squatters are the next and only alternative that the homeless can approach to .
These make-do houses are built cheaply and improperly on wastelands .
Being made from waste metal and wood , the durability and safety of the inhabitant are usually compromised .
These shabby houses have a danger of collapsing with the constant battering of the weather .
Moreover , health dangers are prevalent when certain waste materials are used in the shelter construction according to an article , by Environmental Health Perspectives , Give Me Shelter: The Global Housing Crisis .
Furthermore , squatters in the slums do not have proper sewer system and a clean water source .
Such living conditions are detrimental to society but they are not unavoidable as measures can be taken to rectify these problems .
There are many other processes that can be applied to solve this issue , but I strongly feel that an engineering design process will be the best approach .
Despite being a big stepping-stone to solving the urgent housing crisis , the gaining of support and acceptance from the government of the countries affected will be vital for carrying out this process .
Ultimately , the success of the entire process is one that requires a holistic approach that involves more than the designing of a feasible process , but extends to the community and its government support .
Since entering the 21st century , mankind is faced with a growing number of challenges and threats .
Global warming , the War in Iraq and even the threat of China's rise are all inextricably linked with the need for energy .
Global warming is partly caused by the overuse of fossil fuels and the War in Iraq is mainly resulted from the need of petroleum of USA , while the threat of China actually refers to China's huge demands of resources including energy resources to satisfy the high-speed development of China .
Therefore , among all the current human needs , the need of energy , in my opinion , should be given priority .
In meeting this need , engineering design processes takes an important role .
First of all , engineering design processes help to make good use of new energy resources like hydrogen energy and solar energy .
As we know , the storage and transport of hydrogen have been two major factors that restrict the wide use of hydrogen .
Engineers need to find right materials and design a suitable container for hydrogen so that it can be safely transported and stored .
In terms of solar energy , to improve the utilization and reduce the cost of use is a problem leaves for engineers .
In China , millions of families have already used solar water heater for years , which saved considerable electricity .
However , when trying to convert solar energy into electricity so that it can be easily transmitted , engineers should consider the cost and utilization of solar panels .
Otherwise , it would be an embarrassing situation that the saved energy cannot pay the cost of solar panels , which would make solar energy no market .
Next , traditional fossil fuels can be better used with the help of engineering design processes .
In the process of exploitation of fossil fuels , engineering design helps to find scientific methods to improve resource recovery and reduce resource wasting .
In addition , deep processing of fossil fuels also needs engineering design to improve utilization of fossil fuels .
By doing so , the pollution caused by using fossil fuels can be reduced .
For example , during the process of exploiting oil , the byproducts like natural gas are often burned since it is hard to collect and stored .
Japan has developed the Heat Recovery Steam Generator to generate power by using the waste heat .
Engineering design has played an important role in developing HRSG .
Last , engineering design processes can help to reduce the waste of energy .
When transmitting electricity , some energy is consumed by the wire .
Engineers are trying to find a superconducting material that can work in room temperature to take place of traditional conducting material .
In this way , the energy consumed by the wire will be saved .
Furthermore , the energy- saving appliances designed by engineers have saved inestimable energy for the world .
Engineering design processes have made a great contribution to the world .
In the coming years , human's demand for energy will be increasing whereas renewable energy source are decreasing .
Engineers have compelling obligation to solve this problem .
With the breakthroughs of different domains of science , engineers should shoulder up the responsibility of making these breakthroughs available for people therefore benefit humankind .
The survival of humanity in this century is heavily dependent on the role of Engineers and we should be prepared for potential threats and challenges .
Like many other gadgets created in the 21st century , surveillance technology such as RFID has also made its way into our ever changing lives .
Apart from its many other applications in the business and medical sectors , RFID can be used to track individuals .
Some may argue that it is beneficial to us as it renders us a sense of protection if our locations are known .
In fact , usage of RFID on individuals causes more harm than good as it not only intrudes our privacy (Channel 3000 , n .d .) , our security would also be compromised instead of enhanced .
As such , usage of RFID to track individuals should be banned .
Invasion of privacy has been a major concern in the use of RFID .
Some may argue that tracking ex-convicts with the use of RFID could be used to prevent criminal behavior (BBC News , 2006) .
However , we must not overlook the fact that they are still humans and basic human rights such as privacy should not be disregarded .
Similarly , individual's privacy such as 'habits and movements' should also be kept unknown to the government (Channel 3000 , n .d .) .
To sum it up , no party or organization should have the rights to such profiling/tracking with or without any purpose as it is clearly an intrusion of privacy .
Usage of RFID is useless from the security standpoint (Ou , 2007) .
As such data is being transmitted by radio waves (Bhaskar , n .d .) , it can be easily picked up by a third party who could use it for their own purpose .
This would in turn lead to invasion of privacy as the victim's location is now known .
In worse cases , such information could be used for unlawful activities , such as house breaking .
Arguments put forth that the RFID tags on individuals could be programmed in such a way to minimize information leakage .
However , the cost inflicted would be very high (Ou , 2007) .
Data generated from RFID tags of individuals could also be abused by the intended receivers such as surveillance officers (BBC News , 2006) , adding on a whole new level of security blight .
Although a complete ban on RFID is impossible , its usage on individual tracking should be banned as it intrudes our privacy and compromises our security .

"The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the result of such testing ."
Genetic testing is a medical test which can determine if an individual is potentially at risk of inheriting certain genetic diseases or if a child would be born with genetic condition .
[i] The controversy was brought up when deciding if individual have the final say to reveal such testing as genetic discrimination might surface when the results of such testing is made known to third party .
Moreover , the reliability and accuracy of the tests remain ambiguous .
Hence , the individual should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
First and foremost , genetic discrimination arises when employers lower the chance of promoting genetically-ill individuals or when these individuals are denied a job .
Likewise , these individuals may be required to pay more when they apply for a health insurance .
Since genetic testing is beneficial , some governments have come up with legal procedures that would protect suffers from genetic discrimination .
However , these laws were usually limited[ii] .
"Discrimination is probably going to increase because current laws are ineffective ."
(Gruber J , 2000) .
[iii] In addition , the accountability of such results is questionable considering that the result is often interpreted or analyzed .
According to Kathy L . Hudson (2006) "nothing has happened for the past 6 years , leaving a system in place that still does not routinely evaluate the competence of genetic testing labs" .
Similarly , since the disease might not manifest itself even if one is tested positive , no one should have the right to reveal the results as it is difficult to verify the exactitude of the result .
In conclusion , consequences such as the existence of genetic discrimination should be taken into consideration when deciding whether the tester has the right to reveal his results .
However , since the results of such testing are not completely reliable , the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether the results should be revealed .

In recent years , surveillance technology is getting more and more popular ,especially Radio-Frequency Identification(RFID) .
RFID is a kind of surveillance technology which uses tags and readers to gather information about items attaching with the tags .
While surveillance technology has contributed a lot to the society , it causes troubles such as privacy and security issues(Anonymous 2007) .
Thus proper rules and regulations are needed for surveillance technology , i .e .the use of surveillance technology should be banned in a certain degree .
Privacy issue is the one that most people are concerning about .
RFID tags can simply be used as "spy chips" since the information in the tags can be read off in a distance and then people may "watch "on you without your permission or even awareness .
(Anonymous 2007)Moreover , it is very difficult to get rid of RFID tag as these chips are too thin and tiny to be found and disabled(Surinder MB 2008) .
Thus  , formal regulations about surveillance technology should be carried out and when privacy is affected , the use of such technology should be banned in such cases .
Another problem caused by surveillance technology is the security issue .
Whenever data is collected , the idea of data ownership would go along with it(Surinder MB 2008) .
The problem about surveillance technology is that it is very difficult to control who owns the information .
For example , the unique RFID tag number on an purchased item can be linked to the credit card number used to pay for it(Surinder MB 2008) .
Salesmen may make use of the information to sieve out potential customers and robbers may find out targets from it .
Hence , if the information is open to everyone , our safety in daily lives are not ensured anymore .
However , people may argue that surveillance technology is introduced to help ensure security , and it indeed works very well in preventing crimes to occur and providing information for investigation .
We cannot deny that surveillance technology is effective and convenient , but if data ownership is not controlled , surveillance technology may become a threat to our safety .
Thus , the usage of surveillance technology should be banned when it is used in an abusive way .
In conclusion  ,surveillance technology should be banned for certain degree to ensure that privacy is protected and the security issue is solved also .
The Individual Requesting Genetic Testing Should Have the Final Say in whether to Reveal the Results of Such Testing
As an emerging technology , genetic testing is getting more and more related to people's life as being applied to predictions and diagnoses of diseases .
Since it could indicate the onset of diseases in the future , the results of genetic testing may tag a person with "having inherited defects" (Buchanan , n .d .) .Therefore , it aroused a controversy over that whether the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results .
In my opinion , the right of an individual to decide whether to reveal the results should be protected .
First and foremost , the results of genetic testing belong to medical privacy , which is one of the basic human rights .
An individual is endowed with the right to keep the sensitive medical record .
Additionally , genetic testing is not a mature technique at present and the interpretation of such results is very complicated and variable (Rennie , 1994) .
To some extent , it is irresponsible to reveal the results which are inaccurate or even false .
Moreover , once the results are forced to be revealed , consequences may be significant .
The first one is about emotional impacts .
Genetic testing creates tension within a family because it conveys people the information of getting ill also implies other family members the possibility of having the same defect genes(Kahn ,2000) .
People may feel anxious , depressed , and even guilty of revealing the results .
Gradually , people's life may be destroyed by psychological and mental problems .
The second consequence is about the genetic discrimination , especially in employment and insurance (Norrgard , 2008) .Insurance may not be provided to an individual with results showing the possibility of getting ill .
Besides , it is disadvantageous for getting a job with results showing that the individual is genetically inferior .
In that sense , revealing genetic results may put much more stress on people .
In conclusion , the results of genetic testing do have big impacts of people's life in terms of emotional impacts and genetic discrimination .
However , all the anxiety and pressure may be unnecessary because of the unreliability of such technology .
Therefore , the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results  , and this is also in agreement of protecting human rights .
Genetic testing is a kind of genetic test which determines the vulnerabilities of an individual to inherit genetic disorders (U .S National Library of Medicine , 2009 , para .
1) .
The results obtained from a genetic test can exclude an alleged genetic condition or help verify if a person is a carrier of the genetic disease or have a chance to develop the genetic disorder in future (U .S National Library of Medicine , 2009 , para .
1) .
Upon testing , the individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing (Norrgard , 2008 , Reproductive and Other Familial Concerns , para .
2) .
Family members of the individual requesting genetic testing should also have the rights to know about the results of such testing .
This is because that they might have a higher risk for developing this genetic disease or are already a carrier of this mutation .
Only by recognizing this possibility earlier , they can then make informed choices about their family planning decisions , career and other life choices (Norrgard , 2008 , Genetic Testing is a Matter of Individual Choice , para .
1) .
The use of in vitro fertilization (IVF) method can be used for family planning .
By using this method , only embryos which are free from any genetic disorders are transferred back to women's uterus and allowed to develop to full birth (Norrgard , 2008 , Family Planning , para .
2) .
Alternatively , they can choose chorionic villus sampling (CVS) , a form of genetic prenatal testing (Norrgard , 2008 , Family Planning , para .
2) .
If the foetus had been diagnosed with the mutation , the couple can then choose to terminate the pregnancy (Norrgard , 2008 , Family Planning , para .

Retrieved September 13 , 2009 , from http://www .eyeondna .com/2007/06/09/do-insurance-companies-have-the-right-to-our-dna/
With advances in technology , many genetic diseases which were once considered untreatable might be cured in the near future (Allen , 2006 , Future samples , para .
7) .
It is therefore important to provide close relatives who might be at risk a chance to test whether they are affected by the genetic disease .
This will help them determine their course of treatment or at least make precautions (Allen , 2006 , Future samples , para .
7) .
Furthermore , it is also unfair to the insurance companies if the individual with genetic disease decided to buy life insurance policies without revealing that they have such genetic disorder .
The insurance companies need to be cost effective too .
They should therefore have the rights to request for a medical record (Hsien , 2007 , The question: Should genetic information be disclosed to insurers ? , para .
2) .
In conclusion , the individual requesting genetic testing has the obligation to inform others of his condition (Norrgard , 2008 , Reproductive and Other Familial Concerns , para .
2) .

"The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned ."
Surveillance technology has indeed come a long way since its humble beginnings , evolving from security cameras to sophisticated methods such as Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) and the Global Position System (GPS) .
Advances in this field have allowed us to monitor the activities of people more thoroughly .
It allows for more effective tracing of an individual through an instant identification approach .
Detractors of such systems lament that such act comes at the cost of intrusion into one's privacy .
However , using surveillance technology to track people plays a vital role in addressing criminal issues and can benefit the healthcare sector .
The colossal impact it has on the society is as such a reasonable trade off and thus it should not be banned .
The most important aspect of surveillance technology is that of crime fighting , which in turn results in crime prevention .
Security cameras and closed circuit televisions (CCTV) are being installed everywhere , from homes to offices , shopping malls and even in schools .
These gadgets act as a deterrent to crimes for it captures the illegal acts on tape , and forces a potential criminal to think twice before committing felony .
It too plays a role in solving crimes , often acting as evidence to convict a suspect .
The development of biometrics surveillance has also been touted as the future of crime fighting (BAPCO Journal , 2007) .
Criminal suspects can be easily identified through the matching of physical characteristics such as facial features and fingerprints to a biometric database .
It will hence assist in investigations and empower the capabilities of the police department to detain the offenders .
Surveillance technology also plays an important role in the healthcare industry .
They serve as an essential support in patient care through the monitoring of their well-being .
Hospitals have capitalized on the potential of RFID and have since reaped the benefits .
The patients are issued wrist tags which can be traced to the hand-held communication device of the staff .
This ensures that their movement and behaviour can be consistently monitored .
The tracking of patients is particularly useful in the protection of infant babies , alzcheimer's patients and others with special vulnerabilities (Dr . Counse , n .d .) It alerts the staff should the patient encounter a mishap or wanders away .
The RFID wrist tags also codes for information regarding the patient .
Important data such as the appropriate medication , meal requirements can be easily retrieved , thereby facilitating the job of the nurses .
This method of monitoring minimizes any potential error and enhances efficiency .
It caters increased attention and care for the welfare of the patients .
In conclusion , the use of surveillance technology to track people should not be banned for it is crucial in crime fighting .
It also acts as a useful tool to ensure the patients in hospitals are well-taken care of .
RFID may revolutionize our society in future but at the very moment , it is still in its infant stage where its benefits have yet to warrant a widespread implementation while its disadvantages are surmountable .
Henceforth , the use of RFID should be limited as of now .
Firstly , RFID is redundant as its very purpose of providing security is rendered useless due to the fact that it is relatively easy to copy information broadcasted by the tags (Ou , 2007) .
For example , to gain access to a house protected by RFID , one would only need a scanner and be within range of the owner's tag to copy all the information required for access since the RFID scanner cannot differentiate between the duplicated information and the original form .
As such , RFID poses little deterrence to unwanted guests .
Secondly , RFID infringes one's privacy in the process of tracking the various information associated with that person (Ahson , 2007a) .
For instance , a salesperson can know the preferences of one's shopping habits by scanning the person's purchase records .
In doing so , he can provide better recommendations .
However , be it for enhancement of sales or not , strangers should not be allowed to harness such private information as one's privacy is of paramount importance .
Lastly , it is not effective to introduce RFID to the goods market (Ahson , 2007b) .
A typical RFID tag cost approximately 20 cents while a scanner will cost about a $1000 .
When these devices are used on items that have prices ranging a few dollars , it makes one wonder whether one is paying for the item or for the delivery process .
Furthermore , the lack of standardization of RFID means that different RFID systems require different RFID devices (Ahson , 2007b) .
Store owners importing different goods would thus need different devices and this situation is unwanted .
In conclusion , the use of RFID should be restricted as the negative impacts associated with it are appalling .
Topic: The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing
Genetic testing is a DNA-based test which involves direct examination of the DNA molecule .
Such testing can be used for carrier screening or symptomatic/presymptomatic testing .
The practice of genetic testing has raised many controversies on ethical and social issues .
Some people suggest that the results of gene tests should be revealed .
However , the individual requesting such testing should have the final say in whether to disclose the results of the testing .
There are four reasons on why the decision to disclose the results must lie on the individual requesting it .
Firstly , all results of genetic testing have some margin of errors (Rennie 1994) .
Therefore , the results should be kept confidential to prevent misuse and other potential drawbacks .
Secondly , "one has the right to own property alone as well as in association with others , and no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property" (Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948 , Article 17) .
In this case , the property concerned is the privacy of the medical results , meaning that the individual's medical confidentiality is protected by Human Rights .
Thirdly , the revealing of the genetic testing results may create tension among a family .
Because genes are shared by members of the family , all of them have a fifty percent chance of carrying the same gene as one of them (Rennie 1994) .
In other words , the results can also reveal information about other family members .
Consequently , feeling of depression and guilt may arise among the family .
Lastly , a person with known genetic results may experience 'genetic discrimination' .
For example , an individual with genetic disorders may have difficulty in obtaining insurance and/or employment (Norrgard 2008) .
Some may argue that at-risk relatives should be informed about their susceptibility to genetic diseases , so that they can take early precaution or appropriate treatment to the diseases .
However , most genetic diseases have no means of prevention or treatment (Norrgard 2008) .
Hence , in most cases , disclosing the results of genetic testing to relatives will only bring psychological and mental stress upon them .
In conclusion , for the reason of privacy and technical unreliability as well as to avoid unwanted conditions such as 'genetic discrimination' , the choice to take a genetic testing is an individual's personal matter and the decision on whether to disclose the results or not depends solely on the individual .
Recent years have witnessed the significant growth of surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) .
Along with this growth , many arguments have arisen surrounding the use of RFID on tracking people .
Many people suggest that the use of surveillance technology (RFID) to track people should be banned , while others believe that it should not .
In my view , surveillance technology such as RFID should not be banned because of its positive effects .
Surveillance technology has brought us many applications varying in many areas of our life .
First of all , RFID has played an important role in preventing criminal .
From security view , RFID can provide more precise and complete information on suspects or criminals , which results in the reduction in time and manpower for an investigation .
In other words , when combined with the "intelligent video security system using image process" technology which can "detect unexpected movement or unusual behavior that can pose a threat to people , property and infrastructure" , RFID will prevent many potential risk from criminal or dire threat like terrorism (Focus Group Meeting on Technology Convergence , 2008) .
Not only when combined with such intelligent video technology , RFID can also protect the Homeland security of a country from many threats when it functions separately .
When travelers cross a border of a country , if they obtained "an RFID-enabled border crossing document" , the Border Protection Office or Immigration Office can collect identification and citizenship information of travelers then rapidly determine if they are threats to the country or not , based on the world-wide security information system between many Governments (Use of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Technology for Border Crossings , 2008) .
Another key application from RFID is that RFID helps to improve the healthcare sector .
The wristband with embedded transponder which can be seen in many hospital all over the world is designed basically based on RFID technology .
The wristband allows specific computers or devices to track and identify the holder which can be patients or doctors of the hospital .
Thus , it can warn the management system of the hospital if unauthorized person tries to break into a restricted area or a patient tries to leave the medical condition (RFID in hospitals , retrieved from the Internet) .
For instance , it is more safe now for patients who have mental lost or mental diseases if they are lost , because they are being tracked all the time in the hospital under the surveillance system like RFID .
It is obvious that RFID technology plays a crucial role in improving the healthcare system .

However , others argue that RFID technology have infringed privacy rights of human being .
They claim that information from RFID devices can be approached by a third party and RFID can be used to track individuals illegal if the technology is well-known (Postnote from Parliamentary Office of Science and technology , 2004) .
All such concerns have been already discussed and solved by prudent policies .
Restricted uses and laws has been applied to RFID technology , hence , the information of individuals can only be seen by authorized person legally with positive purpose .
And the fact is that most of people will choose safety and security between security and privacy .
"Ross Anderson , a professor at Cambridge University in Britain , has compared the present situation to a "boiled frog" -- which fails to jump out of the saucepan as the water gradually heats .
If liberty is progressively eroded slowly , people will get used to it" (Focus Group Meeting on Technology Convergence , 2008) .
To conclude , it is indisputable that the advantages of surveillance technology outweigh the negative effect .
In conclusion , surveillance technology such as RFID should not be banned because it not only improve security system for people and country but also enhance the healthcare sector .

Nowadays , genetic testing can provide someone with information regarding his or her genetic condition .
However , ethical issues regarding the genetic testing arise among people .
Since genetic disease is hereditary and can be traced back to the ancestor , many people may inherit the disease .
Therefore , the patient requesting the test should not be the one to decide whether to reveal the result or not .
Some argue that the result is confidential since everyone's genetic information is different (Glenn , 2008) .
However , as argued before , everybody genes may be linked to their relatives' genes , so it is possible for the relatives particularly their sibling to inherit the same defective gene .
Once the disease is confirmed , then their siblings should probably take a genetic test too .
Others reason for instance in medical insurance case that it is unfair to charge individual with genetic defects at a higher rate since the defects are not what they want (Norrgard , 2008) .
But again , if they are charged at the same rate with normal people then they are being unfair to others and the insurance company since the treatment fee for such kind of genetic disease is high .
To conclude , individual requesting for genetic testing should not have the final say as it is unfair to the medical insurance company and the person's relative who may be at also at risk of inheriting the same genetic defects .
*Spinal Muscular Atrophy **In Vitro Fertilization
Since the attack on the London Underground on July 2005 , surveillance technology has generated a lot of attention after they were used to track the movements of the terrorists responsible for the attack .
Reports and articles have shown that the use of surveillance technology to track people can be beneficial to us , particularly in the healthcare and crime prevention sector and enhancing the security area .
Therefore , I fully agree that surveillance technology should not be banned .
Firstly , surveillance technology such as radio identification technology (RFID) can be used to track patients in the hospital where it will notify the nurse or hospital staffs if a patient begins to collapse .
({http://news .cnet .com/Human-chips-more-than-skin-deep/2009-1008_3-5318076 .html}[HYPERLINK: http://news .cnet .com/Human-chips-more-than-skin-deep/2009-1008_3-5318076 .html]) This way , the chances of reviving and saving a patient is greater .
If a patient suddenly collapsed in her room and there is no one to alert the nurse , it will probably take one or more hour for her to be saved when the nurse go around to check on the patients .
By that time , her life would be in danger and this would most probably bring about dire consequences such as death .
Not only that , RFID strap can also be used to monitor patients with Alzheimer's disease .
({http://news .cnet .com/Human-chips-more-than-skin-deep/2009-1008_3-5318076 .html}[HYPERLINK: http://news .cnet .com/Human-chips-more-than-skin-deep/2009-1008_3-5318076 .html])
Secondly , the implementation of radio identification technology in prison can also help to track prisoners and reduce violence in the prisons .
({http://www .rfidjournal .com/article/view/1601/1/1}[HYPERLINK: http://www .rfidjournal .com/article/view/1601/1/1]) .
Prison officers will be able to monitor the movement and exact locations of the inmates and thus this will deter them from committing crimes in the prison .
Not only that , if indeed that a crime happened , the prison guards will be able to investigate and know who is the culprit .
Furthermore , it can also ensure that the inmates do not escape by sending alerts when an inmate approaches the jail perimeter .
Thirdly , surveillance technology can also be use to keep track of our children and prevent kidnapping .
( HYPERLINK "http://technu .nst .com .my/Current_News/techNu/Monday/Notebook/20080211123356/Article/index_html" http://technu .nst .com .my/Current_News/techNu/Monday/Notebook/20080211123356/Article/index_html) .
Parents can strap radio identification technology on the wrist of their children in order to monitor the location of their children .
For example , when the child is missing or kidnapped , the parents will be able to know the exact location of their kids .
This can also help the police in their investigative work .
In conclusion , surveillance technology should not be banned to track people as it not only can save life but also improves the healthcare sector while enhancing the security of our society .
The controversy over whether or not the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in revealing the result of such testing has been present for a long period of time .
Genetic testing refers to the reading of the human genome to identify if one is subjected to genetically linked diseases , such as Alzheimer's disease .
The main issue pertaining to this is that when an individual choose not to disclose the result of the genetic testing , it is actually unfair to and has adverse impacts on both his family and employer .
The result of the genetic testing concerns parties other than the individual alone , and therefore , the individual requesting for genetic testing should not have the final say to whether the results should be revealed to others .
Firstly , often , when an individual is tested to be positive for genetic disorder , he will be reluctant to share the result with others , even the closest kin .
This is unjust to the family members as it meant that they have also , the possibility of suffering from genetic disorder .
They should thus be notified so that they will be able to do necessary family planning , especially in the case if the individual carries a mutation that may result in fatal genetic disorder ({http://www .nature .com}[HYPERLINK: http://www .nature .com] , 2008) .
The importance of sharing the information with family members is recognized , as even during the pretest genetic counseling session , an individual will be advised to share the result with them ({www .ons .org}[HYPERLINK: http://www .ons .org] , 2009) .
Due to the negative consequences of allowing individual to make the decision , individual should therefore not be given the right to have the final say about revealing the result .
Secondly , given choice of not revealing the result of genetic testing , individual will therefore and most of the time chooses to do so to his related company .
This action has an adverse impact on the company .
If during the course of employment , the individual's welfare and safety were being threatened by the work that he was doing , the company will be held liable , despite being ignorant about the dangers that that he were vulnerable to ({http://www .law .duke .edu}[HYPERLINK: http://www .law .duke .edu] , 2002) .
Furthermore , when individual develops into the genetically linked disease , efficiency of work will be reduced , but yet the company will incur additional expenses to cover the issues that arose from a sick worker ({http://www .law .duke .edu}[HYPERLINK: http://www .law .duke .edu] , 2002) .
This furthermore supports that the individual requesting for genetic testing should not have the final say in revealing the result of such testing .
In conclusion , due to the negative consequences on both the family and the related company , individual should not the power of decision-making in whether or not to reveal the result of the genetic testing .
Genetic testing is used to test for genetic disorders , such as Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease .
With the test , people are able to understand the conditions of the diseases which they inherited genes from their parents .
It helps to improve people's lives .
While helping the people , there is also an ethical dilemma and social issues arose with it .
Facing these problems , people who have done the test should have the right to keep the result from others .
One reason for revealing the result to the family members is that the result is not only applicable to the individual but also to other family members , as they may also have inherited the diseases .
Even though the individual may have the responsibility to inform the others about the possibility of them inheriting the genes , one should have the right to decide whether to tell .
The result will give individual the psychological distress and harm , which will actually affect or worsen one's health (U .S . National Institutes of Health) .
When people find out about the test , knowing them might have the genes , the stress level will increases in turn their health will be affected .
Moreover , the test result may be faulty and some people carrying the gene may never develop the disease .
Revealing will cause a burden to them .
Individuals who have done the test may face discrimination (Karen Norrgard , 2008) .
The result may be used against the person .
Insurance company may use the information to raise rates or to deny the insurance .
Employers may not hire or promote them .
Family and friends may treat them differently or even abandon them .
One has to face these consequences even if the possibility of developing the disease is low .
Furthermore , the testing only gives the percentage but not the definitive results .
In making the test known to others , one has to face others' judgements throughout the life .
In conclusion , people should have the right in restricting others from knowing the result of the test as psychological and social issues impose great impacts on people's lives .
Radio frequency identification (RFID) is an example of the surveillance technology used commonly for identification and tracking purposes .
The market for such device is growing very quickly due to its affordable price and widespread use (Sieberg D , 2006) .
However , there are also several problems attributed from the use of RFID .
Most concerns revolve around the fact that RFID invades one's privacy and violates human rights when they are used for tracking people .
Thus , the use of RFID to track people should be banned .
RFID can be used to track individuals as information can be easily retrieved from the RFID tags without their consent .
It becomes impossible to know or detect the presence of a RFID tag since it can be read from a distance away from the individual (DiLorenzo , 2008) .
Furthermore , it is hard to decide who should have the access to such information (Sieberg D , 2006) .
Companies which specialise in RFID tags may pass the information obtained from the RFID tags to any buyer if government does not intervene or control .
In some cases , people are forced to have RFID tags implanted in their body for tracking purposes .
This may lead to even more implications on the welfare of the victims and therefore we should not use such technology to track people .
It is argued that RFID can be beneficial for patients in medical monitoring such as daily temperature taking (Paddock C , 2007) .
However , the use of RFID can have undesirable effects on our body because radio waves from RFID are mutagenic and it is harmful when exposed in large quantity .
Such radio waves can also cause cancer (Paddock C , 2007) .
Therefore , the use of surveillance technology such as RFID should be banned .
In conclusion , we should prohibit the use of RFID tags on individual without consent as they violate location privacy and affects our health .
Therefore , the use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned as it threatens the welfare of individuals .
A lot of surveillance technologies has been invented and developed .
One of them is RFID(Radio Frequency Identification) which has been used widely thorough the world even used to track people .
Yet there are many debates on this tracking concerning the ethical and moral issues .
Some argue that RFID tracking has bad effects in human life but in reality the tracking gives many advantages for human .
Therefore , due to the advantages , the use of RFID in tracking people should not be banned .
Opponents of people tracking using RFID say that the tracking weighs the important privacy of the people tracked and abuses personal information by some unauthorised man (Tan & Li , 2008) .
However , the using of RFID to track is initially according to the agreement of the patients and workers .
In addition , the RFID nowadays have been made with high security to ensure the confidential of the tracked person (Tan & Li , 2008) .
It is also said that the implanting of RFID in human body may cause electromagnetic disturbance in the body (Roberti , 2007) .
However , this effect has not been proved and so far there is no any issue regarding this disturbance .
In conclusion , RFID tracking should not be banned as it does not inflict the privacy of people and gives advantages in many aspects in human life .
Genetic testing is a development in science that allows early detection of genetic diseases (Anonymous , 2005) .
There is often a concern whether the individual should reveal their genetic result as it may bring about several impacts to the individual and to the third party .
Therefore , the individual should bear in mind the consequences and decide whether to reveal their genetic results .
Revealing of genetic test results may pose impacts on the individual as well as the family members .
Firstly , revealing of genetic test may cause the individual to be genetically discriminated (Norrgard , 2008) .
This is due to the fact that genetic testing can reveal possible high-risk diseases the individual may develop .
As such , it has been known that many insurance companies tend to deny individuals essential health care based on their genetic disposition (Anonymous , 2005) .
Secondly , it may create psychological distress to family members if the genetic test results were to be revealed .
As genetic diseases can be inherited among family members , anxiety and fear of inheriting the genetic diseases that the individual has been diagnosed will be created .
Therefore , the individual should have the final say in disclosing their genetic results as it may bring about several impacts .
However , some may argue that revealing of genetic test results of an individual would be able to protect other family members .
Indeed , early knowledge of the risk to genetic diseases might help family members to take preventive measures to reduce the onset of such diseases .
However , one should not forget that once the genetic result of the individual is disclosed , it might be difficult for the individual to integrate into the society as they may be discriminated .
There will be benefits to other parties but adverse implication towards the individual .
Therefore , the individual requesting for genetic test should have the final say in whether to reveal their test results .
In conclusion , revealing of test results may bring about several impacts to the individual as well as the third party .
Hence , the individual should bear in mind the impacts that may arise and decide if they should reveal such results .
Genetic testing is a method that diagnoses an individual's diseases based on their genes through biochemical measurement .
Since it has been brought , it received critics as much as compliments because of the risk of assaulting the individual's parity .
There are many controversies about whether the individuals have rights to disclose their results .
I am inclined to the rights of individuals to reveal their genetic outcome .
Publicizing an individual's result can bring about big impacts on them , due to the discrimination in families , career choosing , health insurance and society hierarchy .
The individual should have rights to decide whether to disclose his results to other .
Genetic testing predicts an individual's inherent risks for the disease and genetic disorders .
Depending on the seriousness of the disease , the individual decides whether to reveal his diagnosis .
Sometimes , if his families and relatives know about his result , they may start to change their behaviour towards the individual .
This may worsen the situation .
Since moral supports are indispensable for one's going , it will evidently cause depression in the individual and exacerbate the individual's chance of disease .
There is also another noticeable problem that the individual might even not want to be worried by his whole family .
Insurance companies will utilize the results to overcharge people .
Some African American workers , in the early 1970s , taking as an example , have the genetic mutation associated with sickle-cell anemia , were denied insurance coverage or charged higher premiums (Andrews , 1987) .
Similarly , in 2002 , the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company had to pay up to $2 .2 million to employees who were secretly tested for a genetic variation for a disorder (Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company , 2002) .
(Karen Norrgard , 2008) .
Moreover , forcing the individual to publicize his result will bring about a new caste system where people are grouped according to the genome .
This group of people will have rights denied from them as they belong to the lower class people .
Is not it another more sophisticated kind of discrimination ?
In conclusion , due to the serious impact in one's life , we should let the individual to decide his revealing genetic results .
Genetic testing has been widely used in the society of modern times .
It allows one to know if he has a genetic disorder by doing the test .
This seems like a good idea but whether to reveal the testing result is a controversy .
Some may feel that revealing the results may be viewed as invading privacy , while in fact; not revealing the results can be seen as being irresponsible .
There are family members , friends and employers who are playing a part in his life .
Thus , due to the implications of many other people , the individual should not have the final say .
An individual who wish to start a family with his spouse should reveal the testing result .
Marriage and having children are not just between the couple , it involves the two families .
Some people are carriers of genetic disorders , they have the genes even if they do not show the disease themselves (Genetic Testing n .d .) .
The unborn child may have the chance to get the disorder from his parents .
It is the responsibility of the individuals to tell their family members the likely outcome of the unborn child .
Therefore , individuals intending to have children need to reveal their testing result .
Some who argue that revealing the test result will attract discrimination such as being viewed as an outcast of the society .
They may be denied insurance due to their disorder .
However , revealing the result can be seen as a form of education to the employers .
They can make sure that their workers with genetic disorders are not being exposed to any environment that may agitate their illnesses (Andre , C . , & Velasquez , M . n .d .) .
Employers have the responsibility to provide a safe working environment for their workers (Andre , C . , & Velasquez , M . n .d .) .
Therefore , this can only be done if individuals reveal their testing result .
In conclusion , individuals should not have the final say as any disorders that they may be found out will affect their family and also the result will allow their employer to provide them a safe working environment .
Advances in genetic testing allow one to detect the presence of abnormal gene which could cause genetic disorder .
This has brought about many debates on whether the individual who undergo genetic testing should have the final say in revealing the results .
While some proponents suggest that it is the privacy of the individual who undergoes the genetic testing , but the test results might also have adverse effects to those who are closely related to that person .
Hence , the individual undergoing the genetic testing should not have the final say in revealing the results .
Firstly , for an individual with positive genetic test results , he has no right in keeping the test results to himself .
He needs to inform his wife in order to make wise decision if they were to start a family (When Do Doctors Recommend Genetic Testing ? , n .d .) .
They need to discuss on whether by not giving birth the disorder can be prevented from being passed on to the next generation .
Alternatively , they can test and abort the fetus affected with the genetic disease .
Hence , this affects not only the person with genetic disease , but also the life partner .
Many critics claimed that individual with positive genetic test result should have the right not to reveal the test results to potential employers .
They argued that the job applicants should not be discriminated just because of the positive genetic test result (Andre and Velasquez , n .d .) .
However , with the knowledge of employees' genetic disorders , employers can better reduce the occurrence of work-related diseases .
Employers can use the information acquired from genetic testing to ensure that their employees are not exposed to environmental agents that might caused them to have increase risk in genetic disorders .
This can ultimately lead to the reduction of work-days loss .
In conclusion , the individual requesting for genetic test should not have the final say in disclosing the test result as it affects not only one person but also the family and employers .
First and foremost , He have to tell his prospective spouse or fiancee about his genetic testing result because; some people who have abnormal gene inherited by their parent won't have observable symptoms of a the disease but will have a 50:50 chance of inheriting the disease to their children (Genetic Testing , 2007) .
By telling to the spouse priorly , they can take preventive medic treatment before planning to have children .
The second reason is an obligation to tell his employer about his diseases .
Some people may argue that it is unfair to use of genetic tests in recruitment of employees or job applicants because it is treating people discriminatively based on fixed characteristic (Andre , Velasquez , n .d .) .
The main purpose of employment genetic screening which is to make sure that the prospective job is safe and not causing complication or any bad effect for those having this kind of diseases .
Hence , genetic testing for job screening purpose isn't violating employees' right .
Last but not least is regarding the sake of other people around him .
Those who have this disease perceived a strong sense of responsibility to share this information with others (Loescher , Crist , Siaki , 2009) .
To sum up , anyone who is suffering from genetic diseases or carrier of this diseases should not has a final say in whether to reveal or to hide about his disease .
Instead , it is a must for him to disclose his disease to: his spouse to save their baby from inheriting the disease , his employer to make sure that his job is safe and all people around him .
Revealing the Genetic testing result will be beneficiary for himself , his employer , his family and all the people around him .
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is an automatic identification system that is used to identify people and items by the transmission of radio waves (DiLorenzo , 2008) .
The use of RFID to track people has invaded privacy and caused a breach to security .
In addition , human implantation of RFID may bring about health and medical problems .
Therefore , the use of RFID to track people should be banned as it would bring about negative impacts to the society .
There are two main reasons why using RFID to track people should be banned .
Firstly , it will cause impingement to privacy and security .
The use of RFID to track people enables law enforcement agencies to know our every move: our location , what we have bought and other information about our lives .
These private information may also be accessed by other parties as the RFID can be decoded and may be subjected to viral threats (DiLorenzo , 2008) .
Criminals may have access to these information and this may put our life in danger as these criminals can easily harm us once they know our exact location .
Secondly , human implantation of RFID to track people may pose health problems .
Animal studies on these RFID microchips suggested that RFID implantation in human may result in cancer (Paddock , 2007) .
In addition , the implanted chip in the skin may move to other parts of the body .
This will cause difficulty in removing the chip and this may lead to other more serious health problems .
Proponents of using RFID to track people argued that such usage of RFID is important in the medical field as it helps to monitor patient's health and enables the immediate retrieval of patient's information (Paddock , 2007) .
However , there is no guarantee that the RFID tag would be protected from security breaches .
As such , patient's medical information may leak out , which in turn may result in social discrimination and loss of health care coverage .
Medical information stored in the RFID may also be altered by hackers and this would lead to error in diagnosis (Sieberg , 2006) .
In conclusion , the use of RFID to track people should be banned as it will cause invasion in privacy , security breaches as well as health problems when RFID chips are implanted .
In recent years , the advancements of 'Radio Frequency Identification' (RFID) have led to its increased use in many major organisations .
One of the uses of RFID has been to track people .
However , critics have been quick to point out that it is an intrusion of privacy and are calling for it to be banned .
I believe that the benefits of RFID used in tracking people far outweigh the 'uncertain' disadvantages and thus it should not be banned .
Firstly , RFID has been seen as a solution to track medical patients .
As mentioned by the "American Medical Association" (Roberti 2007) , RFID allows quick and accurate identification and access to patients' data in times of emergency .
This is to ensure "improved continuity and coordination of care" (Roberti 2007) and reduce the probabilities in "adverse drug events and other medical errors" (Roberti 2007) .
Secondly , the use of RFID has been adopted in oil companies such as "Stratos" (Mehdizadeh 2007) to track and ensure workers' safety .
With the integration of both RFID and Global Positioning System (GPS) , it is used to locate workers' during emergencies .
RFID can also authenticate if the worker has the right to access certain areas and use certain machineries .
Critics though have been quick to identify that the "unauthorised reading and changing of RFID data" (Tan and Li 2008) as an encroachment of privacy .
However , there have been measures being put in place such as the usage of "Authentication" (Tan and Li 2008) to identify the reader .
This prevents "counterfeiting behaviours" and to "control access to label contents" (Tan and Li 2008) .
Distracters have also argued that "RFID may cause electromagnetic interference" (Roberti 2007) , exposing the user to the dangers of magnetic interference .
So far , there has not been a formal report confirming that worry .
In conclusion , I believe that the usage of RFID in tracking human should not be banned as the advantages of its usage outweigh its disadvantages .
And I have absolute trust in scientists to iron out the flaws to make RFID truly the "perfect" solution to many existing limited technology .
Genetic testing is used to examine the genes of a patient or a latent patient , in order to analysis the causes of some diseases .
It is now widespread and ranging from testing the congenital defect of a foetus to finding the existence of the oncogene .
However , with the application of genetic testing , some problems are revealed gradually , such as whether the patients should tell their families about their testing results .
In fact , everyone has to be responsible for the health of their families and themselves , hence , the individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the testing results , and these results should be made known to their relatives .
Firstly , it is immoral for a person to conceal his genetic testing results .
These results will not only affect this person but also affect his families .
It means that when a person tests positive for a gene mutation , his relatives may also have this mutation since they all have similar genes .
If the person does not tell his families about the test results , his families would not know their health deficiencies and would not tell their doctors .
In this case , the person's families are likely suffering from such diseases and missing the earlier diagnosis in the future , which are mainly caused by the person's concealment of his testing results .
Secondly , such concealment will become a source of dispute in marriage .
For example , if a man's genetic testing results indicated some pathogenic genes but he got married with a woman without telling her about these results , the woman might feel that she has been cheated after she knew the truth because she did not want to married to a man with gene deficiency .
In addition , if they already have children and their children also have such pathogenic genes through heredity , who should responsible for these children's health problems ?
In conclusion , the individual should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of genetic testing .
It is important for individuals to share the results with their families in order to avoid diseases and benefit the whole family in the future .
There are two main arguments to support my stand .
Firstly , a couple who is planning get marry and one of them or a close relative of them has an inherited disease is advised to take up genetic testing .
The result of such genetic test affects not only the individual but also affects his family and his fiance .
Both sides of family members should have the right to know the result and will be able to make preventive and treatment measures .
Furthermore , if the couple is planning to give birth but one of them having a positive result of such testing , they can discuss with their closed family members whether to have baby or not .
Thus , there is not right for the individual taking such test to keep the result as a secret .
Furthermore , in my opinion , employers have the right to know such result to ensure that their prospective or current employees are not placed in environments that might be hazardous to them and also can react immediately if something happens (Claire Andre and Manuel Velasquez , n .d .) .
If the individual has the final say to decide whether to reveal the result , it is unfair for his closed family and also people who are related to him if the individual decide to keep the result to him .
Others argued that it is unfair for the individual as the result is a kind of confidential information .
However , by not disclosing of such result , the consequences are serious .
The risk of giving birth to inherit genetic disease child is high and also endanger the individual by exposing himself to work environment that may be hazardous to his health .
In conclusion , the individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing for the sake of himself , his closed family and also his employer .
A genetic test is defined as an assessment of a person's genes to determine the probablitity of inheriting abnormalities or diseases as well as carrier status which he may pass down the generations .
Thus many will say the results must also be make known to his relatives even without his consent .
However , one should have the rights to decide for himself whether he should tell his results to a third party e .g .
relatives or corporations .
It is obvious that everyone have the rights to ensure their privacy , as these are what make us different from animals .
Thus as fellow Homo sapiens , each and every one has the rights to decide for himself .
Proponents may argue that the doctors should also release the genetic testing results to the relatives as these may also involved them .
However , it would be ridiculous that the relatives are able to know that they might also face this particular genetic disease in future from the individual's results since everyone have a unique genome unless they are twins .
And also even they are somehow blood related , the probability of them inheriting the same particular genetic disorder are different .
In conclusion , there could be some laws pass down to settle all these ethical issues .
Ultimately , it still does not solve the root of these problems and the unforeseen situations in the future .
Therefore rights should be given to the individual to decide for himself , as the decisions made will be impactful and irreversible on his life .
The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned .
The development and advances in surveillance technology such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) have made it possible to track anyone , anything , any places , anytime .
This has brought about many debates on the ethics , human rights , privacy and even health concerns surrounding the use of RFID .
Although some argue that the use of RFID to track people brings benefits , it posts great risks to exposure one's privacy to criminals , which is against the human rights and perhaps , threatens one's health .
Thus , such use of RFID to track people should be banned .
The use of RFID to track people is against human rights and violates one's privacy .
By using RFID technology , one's personal information , purchased goods and whereabouts can be tracked easily by private corporations or government (DiLorenzo 2008) .
Worse , hackers and analysts can remotely read the information from RFID which stores private information such as your credit card passwords , medical history and location (Sieberg 2006) .
Although some argue that RFID technology that stores one's information in RFID such as credit card or identity card provides great convenience , it creates chances for criminals as well at the same time .
Furthermore , tracking one's private information is against human rights .
Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that no one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy , family , home or correspondence , nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation .
Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks .
Health concerns are also related with the use of RFID to track people .
Some companies have implanted RFID microchips in their staffs to track their locations and information .
However , some studies showed that lab mice and rats sometimes developed sarcomas , or malignant tumors , after being implanted with microchips (Paddock 2007) .
Although humans are different from lab mice , there is a risk that what happened on the mice might happen on humans as well .
Furthermore , ifthe microchips react with a strong electrical or magnetic field , the implant could be destroyed and cause serious burns .
In conclusion , RFID should not be used to track people as it not only posts great risks to one's privacy and health but also violates ethics and human rights .
The use of RFID to track people should be banned by law and rules .
Genetic testing has enabled people to test for certain genetic diseases , especially those which they might be prone to and thus go for necessary treatments or make necessary arrangements .
However , it has also led to privacy and confidentiality problems whereby the results of the test have become a topic for debate .
Making known the results of genetic testing to relevant parties such as employers and even family members can cause ethical and social problems .
Thus , individuals requesting genetic testing should always have the final say on whether to reveal the test results to a third party .
The result of the test is the property of these people .
Thus , others should never be allowed to reveal or look into it without the permission of the owner .
This is to prevent others from using the information to discriminate against them .
For example , an employer might choose to not hire or to fire someone if he is to find out that the person has a certain disease such as cancer or Huntington disease (Maxwell & Mehlman , 1999) .
This might cause greater problems to the person involved especially if he is the breadwinner of the family .
Another social consequence would be when individuals are discriminated against in Health coverage based on their genetic make-up .
For example , insurance companies might increase the premiums of customers who are at risk for a certain disorder or even cancel their policy .
This discrimination would be very unfair to the individuals involved (Norrgard , 2008) .
Therefore , these individuals should always have the final say .
While it may be difficult even for the individual to accept the results of the test , sharing the news with their relatives and friends may be the larger concern .
While some may feel that it is the moral obligation of these individual to inform his immediate family members of positive results of inheritable diseases such as cancer or HD , since they too may inherit the disease , I feel that there is no need for such an action as the result is after all private and confidential .
Also , certain genetic test such as the test for disorders of sexual development is a very private matter .
If an individual is to be tested positive for this disorder , such that she has the genotype for males but has phenotype for females , she might be ostracised and suffer self-esteem problems (Borenstein , 2009) .
If these individuals have the final say on whether to share the result , they would be less stressed as they do not have to be concerned with the views of others whom they do not want to share the result with .
This would give them more time to adjust to their personal emotion .
In conclusion , the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing should always lie on the individual who has requested for the test .
With the advances in medical technology , it is now possible to identify one's genetic susceptibilities to certain diseases and disorders .
Despite the fact that genetic testing can bring about more opportunities for early discoveries of treatable disorders , there are still many controversies revolving around ethical issues on genetic testing .
Many argue that revelation of testing results may invade personal privacy and bring about discrimination .
Besides ethical implications , medical implications such as accuracy of test results are also concerns the general public hold for the issue .
Therefore , with these concerns , it is important that the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
The two main ethical concerns regarding genetic testing are privacy and discrimination .
Firstly privacy is one of the worries one will have while considering whether or not to carry out genetic testing .
The fear for disclosure of results to third parties might discourage people from participating in the testing although the test might be favourable to them .
Furthermore , health care providers might also reveal the person's genetic status to concerned family members which in turn weakened our confidence in the providers .
(Holtzman , 1996) Secondly , information from genetic testing of individuals with genetic susceptibilities is used by employers and insurance companies to deny them employment as well as to grant lower insurance coverage .
This is generally known as discrimination .
(Holtzman , 1996) With reference to a survey conducted by Georgetown University , out of 332 families with genetic susceptibilities , "22% reported they had been refused health insurance , and 13% had been fired from their jobs based on their perceived genetic risks ."
(Of Genes and Pink Slips: Genetic Testing Goes to Work , 2005) Up to date , not many laws have been passed down to protect the rights of people with higher genetic risks .
However , some would argue that such discrimination against employees is fair as an employee with genetic susceptibility to a known disease might bring about deleterious effects to the company's operations and other employees .
Alternatively , companies should allocate other job which is more suitable and does not put the employee at risk .
(Holtzman , 1996) In this way , both parties benefit and there is no unfair discrimination .
In conclusion , individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing so as to protect oneself from discrimination and invasion of privacy .

Should the individual requesting genetic testing have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing ?
Now days , genetic testing has caused ethical and moral issues .
One of them is about the privacy and confidentiality of the individual who undergo genetic testing , whether he or she should reveal the results of the testing to third parties or not .
While it is true that people's individual right should be respected , but if others can be saved by revelation of the results of the person undergo the genetic testing then it should be done .
Thus , the individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
There are several advantages by revealing the results of genetic testing to third parties .
It is also commonly known that if a person has genetic disease , there is a chance that his or her relatives would have the same disease too .
If the genetic testing is revealed to the relatives and they end up having the same disease , they could be saved by preventing the disease to develop further more .
Another thing is people's life is obviously more important than privacy , especially if it's your loved ones .
Therefore it is encouraged to reveal the result of genetic testing , especially to your relatives .
In conclusion , the individual undergo genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing as they are protected by the laws against discrimination and also because other people's life could be saved .
The rights and wrongs on using surveillance technology on the public has been an issue for a long time .
The issue of privacy was commonly used to outweigh the aspects of safety and security .
The ban of surveillance technology should not be imposed on .
By allowing proper usage of surveillance technology , one could increase the level of security and safekeeping in a country as well as improving work efficiency at a workplace .
The use of surveillance technology could increase the level of security and safekeeping of a country .
By using video surveillance technology specifically at appropriate places , it could help the government protect the public more efficiently such as preventing the crimes before it happened (Gray , 2009 , p .1) .
As reported in the news last year , West Virginia decided to use video surveillance technology on its highways to help in the finding of missing children (Stump , 2008 , p .1) which resulted in one hundred percent recovery of the missing children (Stump , 2008 , p .2) .
On another side , it can also help improve the work efficiency at a workplace , more commonly in office work settings .
In an office set-up , the atmosphere is created by separating employees into cubicles .
The cubicles allows employees to do things unrelated to work and employers are unable to push the employees to get the work done when they spend more than half the time using the facilities available for their own indulgence .
Thus by setting up an electronic surveillance to keep track of the employees' usage of facilities , the employees will become more 'aware' of their situation and start taking their job more seriously , improving work efficiency (Heathfield , n .d . , p .1) .
Though there is an issue regarding the invasion of one's privacy , this could be resolved by placing appropriate safeguards which protect the public's privacy when implementing the use of surveillance technology (Gray , 2009 , p .3) .
In conclusion , the use of surveillance technology should not be banned as it could increase the level of security and safety of a country and also enhance work efficiency .
Topic: "The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing ."
Genetic testing is a medical test , which is used to diagnose the disorder in the genome of a person and determine if this mutation can cause a specific disease .
With the development of ability to test for genetic disorder , an arising problem that has been "the subject of significant debate within the bioethics community" (Mehlman , 1999 , para .5) is the privacy of genetic information .
Generally , the consensus for this problem is that genetic information should not be disclosed against people's privacy .
To protect the welfare of patients with genetic problem , their genetic information should not be disclosed over their objection or even without their permission .
But in fact , there are some arguments that revealing this information can protect some third parties from harm , for example , enable the avoidance of inherited disorder .
Thus , there should be strict laws to ensure patients' right to decide on revealing their testing results , which means it definitely needs their permission to do so .
In conclusion , until these laws are enacted , not revealing such information without patients' consent or using other method like alias testing are the better choices .
Monitoring employees at workplace and installing video cameras at public places such as banks , stores or restaurants are one of the debatable issues today .
Whereas advocates of such surveillance technologies emphasize on the benefit as to promote work efficiency and secure communal settings , opponents strike back by stating intensified concerns related to individual privacy .
Nevertheless , the banning of surveillance technology should not be enforced , for the manifest reason that its strengths outweigh weaknesses and privacy concerns could be reduced once proper use is implemented .
To elaborate , the benefits of surveillance might be classified into two categories .
Firstly , the monitoring system at workplace indeed effectively drives employees to perform better .
Meanwhile , surveillance on lax supervisors may evidently verify their incompetence (Heathfield , n .d) .
Namely , mutual surveillance guarantees active working environments , as well as bringing high productivity and huge profits to the employers .
Secondly , as Mr . Gray , Mayor of Lancaster , states , the use of surveillance technologies plays a utilitarian role in public security and criminals detecting (Gray , 2009) .
For instance , video cameras in supermarkets can detect anyone suspicious of stealing or record the process of a burglary .
Sometimes criminals will be deterred if they are aware of the hidden surveillance .
Furthermore , the tracking of criminals using hi-tech sensors or video cameras largely shortens the chasing time of the police (Stump , 2008) .
Concerns of privacy issues might be crucial to constructing regulations on the implementation , however , the solutions are abundant thus the banning of surveillance technology is utterly unnecessary .
To illustrate , companies shall not be allowed to monitor phone calls expect for business related ones (Heathfield , n .d .) .
Simultaneously , the safeguards should be briefed on their integrity so as not to reveal any information obtained through surveillance; strict penalties should be enforced on those who fail to preserve privacy (Gray , 2009) .
The monitoring system has to be regularly assessed to prevent privacy invasion .
To sum up , surveillance technology should not be banned as its usefulness in workplace and enhancing public safety makes it an indispensable tool in today's world .
Surveillance in context is the close observation of a person or a group .
In the past , surveillance is conducted through human to human tracking .
With advances in technology , surveillance nowadays is aided by equipments such as closed-circuit TV (CCTV) , camera , voice recorder and RFID (radio frequency identification) .
This has brought about debates on ethical and moral issues with regards to the usage of surveillance technology especially RFID .
There may be arguments that surveillance technology is beneficial to humans in this modern era .
While not compromising the benefits it brings , the ethical and moral issues regarding surveillance technology far outweighs the benefits it bring .
Thus , it should be banned .
In conclusion , the disadvantages of surveillance technology outweigh the advantages .
The effectiveness is in doubt , human rights are invaded and there could be abuse of this technology .
Therefore surveillance technology should be banned .
The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
With current technological advancements in genetics , there are many genetic tests available for the public , from testing for inheritance diseases and terminal illnesses .
I believe that an individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
The individual should be given the choice as , the emotional hurt from the media release of these results , the use of results against the individual .
However , professional assistance should be available for the individual to seek advice .
Firstly , the emotional hurt from the world wide release of the individual's genetic information can overwhelming .
With the outreach of the mass media , reports of genetic disorder of an individual could be known to the world in minutes .
(Seth , 2009) This will cause humiliation , especially when he/she is a professional , like an athlete .
However , many of these genetic disorders are unidentified late , inherited and incurable .
(Seth , 2009) The Olympics have tested their female athletes over five games and found 27 out of 11373 women tested positive for hermaphrodite (Seth , 2009) .
Secondly , the unintentional use of the genetic information can be disadvantageous to the individual and undermine the individual's ability , career , social interactions and economical choices .
In the interest of the corporation , people who are tested positive for terminal illness will not be provided health insurance or the career advancement .
(Maxwell , 1999) Knowing one's death is approaching , the individual could make inappropriate social choices that can harm him/her and others .
(Norrgard , 2008)
However , if the individual is unable to make the appropriate choice of the usage of the genetic results , a professional doctor should step in to provide relevant advice , while maintain patient-doctor confidentiality .
The individual may refused to release the genetic test's result , when it could provide treatment or prevent the spread of the illness within the family , in the fear of discrimination and humiliation .
(Norrgard , 2008)
With the disastrous outing from the media release of genetic information and the use of genetic information against the individual , I believe that the individual requesting the genetic testing should have the final say in the release of the results .
But , if the choice cannot be made by the individual , a professional should provide appropriate release and use of the results .
The Individual Requesting Genetic Testing Should Not Have the Final Say in Whether to Reveal the Results
Genetic testing is the analysis of genes , chromosomes , RNA and proteins .
It is used to predict the risk of disease , identify carriers of disease , diagnose disease (Genetic Testing , 2006 , para 1) , and can also be used to determine parents of the child .
Genetic testing includes scientific methods in biology , chemistry , and sometimes even biochemical tests .
Nowadays , as the technology developing , individuals have more approach to such tests .
However , such people requesting genetic tests should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of the tests .
Secondly , when the result of a particular genetic test is beneficial to the whole society , researchers have the very right to disclose such outcome .
As we know , scientists all over the world are working together to make people life better by studying the genome of human and other organisms .
In doing such a significant project , they need numerous different genes to work on .
Sometimes discovering an insignificant phenomenon or test results and anglicizing it can really make a breakthrough .
Hence , when an individual requesting genetic testing comes up with an interesting exploration , it may change the perspective in looking into the subject , for instance , treating cancer , AIDS or some hereditary diseases .
As a result , these individuals should not have the final say in hiding their results .
In contrary , the results should be shared among scientists and researchers for the whole world's sake .
In conclusion , individuals who request genetic testing should not have final say in revealing the results or not for two major reasons: protecting their blood relatives from genetic disorders and helping the whole society for genetic researches .

Advances in technology have made surveillance technology so common nowadays .
Surveillance technology is the electronic equipment use to monitor the behavior and activities , usually of people without his permission .
Argument on the banning of the use of surveillance technology has been going on for years .
The use of surveillance technology should not be banned because it is useful in ensuring the public safety and monitoring workplace in a company .
The use of surveillance technology should not be banned because it can bring important benefits to us .
Firstly , in companies , surveillance technology is used to monitor employees at work (Heathfield , n .d . , p .1) .
Employees might seem to be surfing the web for business purposes at all time , but what they actually doing is personal business such as online banking , shopping and chatting .
If the behavior of employees at work is monitored , they will work more efficiently and contribute to the company .
Secondly , surveillance technology helps in enhancing and ensuring public security (Gray , 2009 , para .1) .
Tracking of missing or kidnapped children (Stump , 2008 , para .1) , movement of dangerous criminals and terrorists can be done using video and satellite surveillance .
The cameras have the function of identifying , detecting and recording vehicles' number , suspect's action and those illegal organizations' movement .
These help the police to solve cases especially criminal and traffic cases in the shortest time .
Arguments put forth in support of banning the use of surveillance technology are faulty .
It has been argued that one's privacy might be invaded (Heathfield , n .d . , p .2) .
However , monitoring can take place under suitable circumstances and to an appropriate extend .
It has also been said that surveillance of employees can affect the relationship between employer and employees (Heathfield , n .d . , p .2) .
However , this only applies to those minority spending most of the time online doing personal things and do not meet the company's goals .
Using of surveillance technology has no impact for those focusing on work and doing the right thing (Heathfield , n .d . , p .2) .
In conclusion , the used of surveillance technology should not be banned as it benefits a lot to us in public security and also business efficiency .
"The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing ."
Development and advancement in the field of genetic research has challenged the scientists and the public on a wide range of issues especially issue relating ethical concerns .
Although it seems that confidentiality of the test result is a personal matter , disclosure of such result would eventually benefit the community as a whole in the long run .
Therefore , result of genetic testing should be revealed without the consent of the person who requested it .
Firstly , result of genetic testing should be fully disclosed as it enables third party to get treatment or prevention before the condition worsens (Maxwell & Mehlman , 1999) .
By and large , genetic disorders can be inherited within family members as the defective gene might be passed on from one generation to another .
The decision to reveal a genetic test result such as breast cancer would help early detection and treatment .
Some may argue that disclosure of such results would cause discrimination towards the patients .
However , Science Daily (2008) notes that Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) has been approved to forbid insurance company from discriminating through reduced coverage or pricing and prohibits employer from making adverse employment decision in order to encourage more people to undergo genetic test which could save lives in the long run .
Secondly , revealing the result of genetic testing would help in making important life decisions .
In the case of Huntington's disease , a lethal genetic disorder , the result is also desired by family members and potential mates as it would help them to make important decisions , such as whether or not to have children or abort an affected fetus .
Under this circumstance , the final say of revealing the result should lie on the physician , who has a better understanding on the patient's condition .
Although the general agreement seems that disclosure of testing result should not over the patient's objection , this would be an exception if it is to protect third party to avoid other serious consequences (Mehlman & Maxwell , 1999) .
In conclusion , result of genetic testing should be revealed without the consent of the person who requested it as this would not only enable third party to get early prevention or treatment but also help others to make life decisions .
Genetic testing is able to analyze whether a subject is confirm to develop or inherit a particular genetic disease .
It assures the patient whether they are a carrier or will develop the disease .
Although the results are beneficial , it has implicated family members who are genetically common .
But are they able to inform the family members to safeguard their personal health yet not breaching the issues of confidentiality and privacy ?
My stand is as long disclosure has no serious social/ethical consequences , the subject will have the final say .
In conclusion , genetic testing is bound to bring ethical or social consequences if privacy and confidentiality are not met .
Regulatory framework such as Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act has ensured genetic discrimination is legislated .
With imposing law , people feels safer to undergo genetic testing; being the deciding factor to disclose their genetic results to family members or third party under their obligations .

The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should not be banned .
One pivoting reason to why RFID should not be banned includes its application to augment public and national security .
Repeated offenders and past sexual criminals can be tracked via RFID to allow for preventive measures if they are detected near places where they usually commit their crimes in .
(Brady , 2008 , para .
6) Similarly , monitoring of terrorist suspects for any suspicious movements and contact to insurgent groups can be aided by a RFID implant .
Furthermore , these suspects could then benefit from the freedom unobtainable inside of detention centres , while simultaneously alleviating the problems faced by overcrowded prisons (McKay , 2008) .
Without RFID , these would be nearly impossible due to limited security manpower .
In addition , using RFID to track a person's information can play a crucial role in medical services .
In the near future , people may opt to implant a RFID storing key medical data such as blood type and allergies into their bodies .
During a case of an unfortunate accident , medical officers would be able to gather these data almost instantaneously from a possibly unconscious patient .
The time saved from medical tests prior to an emergency operation might then improve the chances of a successful attempt to save the patient's life .
With proper regulation and use , RFID tagging may on the contrary to many arguments , ensue greater freedom and privacy given to the person implanted with RFID .
For example , as an alternative to incarceration , criminal suspects could opt to be electronically monitored in the outside world (How fair , n .d . , para .
7) .
While some may argue that such technology may be misused , laws such as imposing a mandatory need of consent from the people involved and a restriction to the ownership of RFID readers can be instituted instead of a total ban .
Thus , with the complement of these regulations to the inexhaustible list of benefits , the usage of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should not be banned .
Rapid advances in genetic research and technology led to important advances in the detection of genetic conditions and diseases (Chris and Bryn 2002) .
Genetic testing have however raised ethical concerns like whether the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing (Chris and Bryn 2002) .
There are severe consequences if the results are not handled and communicate properly by third parties .
Therefore , individuals should have the final say .
Individuals are to be treated equally as required by law unless there are relevant reasons like differences in skill , knowledge or experience (Chris and Bryn 2002) .
However , it is very likely that employers will use the results to discriminate employees based on unfounded perceptions of health risks and possible future disabilities (Chris and Bryn 2002) (Neil and Ronald 2006) .
Likewise , the insurance companies may make use of the results to charge a higher premium or not provide insurance because of possible chances of high medical bills in the future (Chris and Bryn 2002) (Neil and Ronald 2006) .
Thirumoorthy T . Medical Confidentiality [Internet] [cited 2009 Sep 16] .
Available from: www .sma .org .sg/whatsnew/ethics/Y1_S8_thiru .ppt
Doctors have to adhere to medical ethics , in which they required to respect the confidentiality of the patients (Thirumoorthy 2009) .
Both the Hippocratic Oath and International Code of Ethics states that without the prior consent from the patient , doctor are not allowed to disclose any information which he has obtained (Thirumoorthy 2009) .
Hence , by revealing the genetic testing result without permission from the individual , it constitutes a breach of medical confidentiality .
Even to family members , individuals should have the final say .
Like the phrase , "Ignorance is bliss" , if the results are not related to the family members or they have lower risk of getting the genetic disorder , telling them may cause unnecessary worries (Agatha , Denise and Kathleen 2009) (Gillian , Denise and Bartha 2009) .
There are also considerations like age and maturity level (Gillian , Denise and Bartha 2009) .
If the family member is old and no longer under high risk or a child who is too young to be at risk , there is no need to reveal disturbing results that may cause potential psychological harm to them (Agatha , Denise and Kathleen 2009) (Gillian , Denise and Bartha 2009) .
Some individuals may also be waiting for the "right time" , such as avoiding the need to disrupt or jeopardize major life events like graduation , marriage , pregnancy , childbirth (Gillian , Denise and Bartha 2009) .
In addition , the individual might not even be close to their family members .
In fact , there may even be bad blood between them .
The family members may instead use the results against the individual .
In conclusion , the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of genetic testing .

"The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned ."
In this 21st century , modern technology has advanced to a stage where radio frequency identification (RFID) is implanted into people to locate and identify them .
RFID is a chip that has a small antenna to transmit vast amount of information from a human's body to a computer using a scanner (Sade , 2007 , p . 1) .
RFID enhances productivity in the healthcare system , helps to monitor ex-offenders and also helps to locate missing personnel .
Thus , due to the benefits brought about by RFID , it should not be banned .
Firstly , the use of RFID to identify patients enhances productivity in the healthcare system (Sade , 2007 , p .2) .
The use of RFID can minimize the long registration time for patients so that they are able to seek treatment in the shortest possible time .
When a patient goes to the hospital , his medical records which are already stored in a RFID tag can be immediately traced out using the RFID scanner .
In doing so , time could be greatly minimized and many more innocent lives will be saved .
Hence , the use of RFID is greatly beneficial in the medical field .
Secondly , implanting RFID tags into ex-offenders facilitates the authorities in monitoring their activities .
Police will be alerted in the shortest possible time when these ex-offenders are in a position that may harm victims (Rfid based proximity sensor and alert system for fugitives , sex offenders , missing soldiers and the like description/claims , 2008) .
This helps to save innocent lives and reduce crime rate in the country .
It also allows ex-offenders to have their freedom and at the same time , the police will be alerted when they commit a crime .
This gives the public a sense of security and hence , the use of RFID to monitor ex-offenders is beneficial to the society .
Thirdly , RFID can also help to locate missing personnel .
People who are embedded with the tag would be scanned and their location can easily be found .
This is especially useful for the elderly who suffer from dementia .
When they are not able to find their way home , their family members can make use of RFID technology to track them down .
Hence , the use of RFID greatly speeds up the tedious process of finding missing personnel and at the same time , minimizes wastage of resources .
In conclusion , with these benefits that RFID have brought to people , it is undeniable that using RFID to track people will only improve the current situation and hence , it should not be banned .
Technological advances have brought along pros and cons ever since it sets in to our daily lives .
One of the many technologies innovated is the surveillance technology , mainly RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) .
'Tracking' , in this context , is defined as both monitoring and identifying the location , behavior , activities and changing information such as medical information .
Admittedly , personal privacy will be intruded .
Nevertheless , it has the ability to track criminals , improve the efficiency of our healthcare system , as well as to expedite the cracking of criminal cases .
Therefore , owing to the significant advantages of RFID , it should not be banned .
Tracking activities plays a crucial role in identifying terrorists and monitoring ex-criminals .
By implanting the RFID tags in both groups , their location will remain known to the police force and relevant authorities , thus allowing consistent monitoring of activities .
It has always been a common objective between countries to wipe out terrorism (Rhea Wessel , 2006) so that world peace could be maintained .
Adding on , monitoring ex- criminals will not only forbid them from committing crimes again , but more importantly , allow the public to have a peace of mind employing them , subsequently making them feel accepted by the society .
Therefore , given the advantages of surveillance technology , it should not be banned .
Surveillance technology such as RFID can improve two components of our healthcare system .
Firstly , it cuts down on the waiting time to be attended to .
A scan on the tags allows healthcare personnel to instantly identify the medical information of patients .
Secondly , wasted time on retrieving essential information of patients during emergency could be put into treating the patients (http://www .verichipcorp .com) .
Crucial moments could determine life and death .
Therefore , the RFID technology can better our healthcare system's efficiency .
Expediting the cracking of criminal cases is another point to why surveillance technology should not be banned .
Tracking locations could never be more important in cases such as kidnapping (http://www .verichipcorp .com) .
Crimes like this should be attended to in the shortest possible time as it may result in injuries or even death of victims .
Furthermore , it could lower the crime rate , thus benefiting all people .
Hence , surveillance technology can assist in cracking criminal cases .
In all , surveillance technology benefits us greatly in several aspects and thus should not be banned .
"The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned ."
Surveillance technology in the form of Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) has brought about many improvements in the efficiency and procedure of our systems .
RFID is an electronic method of exchanging data over radio frequency waves .
My article will focus on the uses and advantages of RFID to track people .
Tracking is defined to be locating the whereabouts of a person and the identification of personal information .
I strongly believe that the proper handling of such technology will bring countless advantages and thus , the use of RFID to track people should not be banned .
The use of RFID to track criminals will improve the safety and security within a prison and ultimately , improve the overall national security .
Tracking criminals will allow the prison security to know the exact location of every inmate .
This will minimise the risk of violence and prisoners escaping .
This is being supported by statistics done by correctional institutions that cases of violence decreased by 65 percent when the RFID system was introduced (Casciato 2008) .
Even when such events occur , the investigation and the recapturing of those involved would be more easily dealt with the use of RFID .
Incorporating the use of RFID in the healthcare industry will improve the efficiency and current practice of the sector .
The storage of key medical records and information in a radio-transmitting chip will cut down time spent on registration and thus , allowing patients to receive prompt treatment .
In times of emergency when key information such as blood type and allergy could be retrieved at an instant by scanning the chip , the most appropriate treatment can be decided in the shortest possible time .
This can prove to be vital in saving a person's live .
Lastly , the use of RFID to locate the whereabouts of children can help to reduce incidents of human trafficking .
In less developed countries like Cambodia , there is a large volume of children being trafficked and forced into labour and prostitution .
With the use of RFID to locate a victim , it will allow the authorities to capture the people behind such activities and provides a solution to the problem of human trafficking .
In conclusion , the benefits that RFID brings are immeasurable and thus , the use of it to track people should not be banned .
In all , RFID should be banned as it not only invades our privacy and it may impose serious risk to our human body .

With the advanced Science and technologies , potential diseases become predictable nowadays .
For instance , a ten years-old child could undergo a genetic testing and predict the risk of getting Huntingdon's disease in middle age .
This achievement , however , raises a controversy of whether an individual who requests genetic testing should have the final say to reveal or not reveal the results of such testing .
Since the disclosure might bring negative effects to the individual's family and induce discrimination in employment as well as the purchase of insurance , I would like to agree with the statement of having right to decide the revealing of genetic test result .
When an individual is tested positive for hereditary disease , disclosure of the result might impact his family negatively .
Family tension would be created if the revealing of the result happens at inappropriate moment .
Agatha M . Gallo and her colleagues (2001) note that the decision of disclosing genetic testing result should be made by considering some major life events such as graduation and marriage (Am J Nurs . , 2001 , To disclose or not to disclose ?
section ,  3) .
This is obvious and could be imagined that when the individual discloses the information to his brother who is doing preparation for the A-level final examination , for example , the latter would be overwhelmed with stresses whereby affecting his performance during the examination .
In a nut shell , disclosure of an individual's genetic testing information might incur woes in his life .
Everybody should be considerate and let the individual to decide whether he is willing to reveal the test result .
He should have the final say .
Technological advancements in the medical field today have offered us a variety of genetic tests .
Although this technology is beneficial to mankind , there is an ongoing controversy pertaining to the question on who should have the final say in revealing the test result to a third party .
While some may argued that doctors should reveal the result as it may directly affect a third party , we should still look into the concerns individuals have , such as the loss of employment and insurance after the results are made known , their rights to privacy and medical confidentiality and family considerations .
Firstly , all individuals should have the rights to make decisions that will affect their future .
In recent years , the Council for Responsible Genetics (CRG) had found that employers and insurance companies are increasingly biased against people who tested positive in a genetic test .
This practice is currently known as 'Genetic Discrimination' (CRG 2001) .
With this practice in place , individuals will never be treated fairly and their prospects will not be bright , especially in this economic downturn .
Besides employment , individuals may also be denied the much needed insurance to protect themselves against any future mishaps (CRG 2001) .
Secondly , individual's rights to privacy and confidentiality must be observed .
In the United States , doctors are obliged to adhere to the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identiable Health Information (Privacy Rule) (Sharpe and Carter 2006) .
This would mean that they have to respect the patient's decision on whether to reveal the genetic test result .
However , in cases where revealing the result is necessary to prevent an imminent threat to others , doctors are able to make this decision on behalf of the patient (Sharpe and Carter 2006) .
Despite this , doctors should make careful analysis before making the decision so as not to infringe unnecessarily into the privacy of the individual .
Lastly , individuals are able to factor in family considerations when deciding whether to reveal the result to the relatives .
Some of the factors that affect the individual's decision are the vulnerability and receptivity of relatives towards the result , the timing for revealing the result , and also the family relationships between the relatives (Nycum , Avard and Knoppers 2008) .
Doctors would never consider these factors comprehensively if they were to have the final say in the revealing the test results .
In conclusion , individuals should have the final say in whether to reveal the genetic test result if it does not pose an imminent threat to a third party .
This is because the process involves their family members , their rights on making decisions that will affect their future and also their rights to privacy and confidentiality .

Topic: The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such thing .
Nowadays , with advanced medical technology , people can apply genetic testing to identify changes in chromosomes , genes , or proteins(Genetic Home Reference , 2009) .
This kind of technique provides convincing results of the gene information that the individual carries .
While as it is more and more widely used in medical test , how to deal with the results appropriately brings fierce debates on ethic and other issues .
Some claim that the results of genetic testing belong to the privacy of the person , therefore whether to reveal them should depend on the individual himself .
However , if the final decision just depends on the individual , it will not only curb the genetic research development but also delay the precaution of potential risk that some genes convey .
Thus , the individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such thing .
In conclusion , the final say on whether to reveal the results of genetic testing should not depend on the individual as it not only has negative effects on genetic research development but also delays the precaution of potential health risk .
Thus , the individual should not act as judges to decide whether to reveal the results of genetic testing .
Surveillance is the systematic supervision or monitoring of the movement or information of an individual or a population .
(Bogonikolos , 1999) .
In recent years , numerous state-of-the-art surveillance devices and software emerged rapidly .
These surveillance technologies bring great advantages in authorization of law enforcement authorities by monitoring and securing prosecution evidence on criminal and terrorist activities .
However , its thorough interception capability and high cost consumption raised strong controversies .
The resulting consequences discussed below will further consolidate our claim that surveillance technology usage should be banned .
Firstly , surveillance technology performed on large population implies violation of privacy and civil rights .
Government agencies conduct mass surveillance on social networking sites , phone calls and broadband internet traffic hence covertly record civilian's private or confidential data .
In addition , corporate companies and central banks embedded RFID chips into products and paper notes with original purposes of tracking purchased products and cash passage between individuals .
(Yoshida , 2001; Eden 2005) However , an individual's anonymity and privacy will be gone simply when RFID scanners reveal one's personal interests , purchase records , money transaction and current location .
Likewise , modern corporate companies profaned employee's privacy by monitoring their performance at workplace , checking their email and phone log and tracking their movement at working hours .
(Moore , 2000) Hence , disclosure and storage of personal information of those under mass surveillance lead to invasion of privacy and confidentiality .

In addition , lump sum government expenditure on surveillance implementation and maintenance is considered resources wastage .
For instance , estimations suggest that installation of nationwide surveillance network around China will account for $33 billion by year 2010 , which is "around the same amount Congress has allocated for reconstructing Iraq" .
(Klein , 2008 , p . 6) Moreover , scientific research showed that majority public surveillance camera reduces crime merely to a slight degree which failed to overweigh annual equivalent cost .
(Gill & Spriggs , 2005) Nevertheless , poor image quality of surveillance camera video footage caused by excessive compression and minimized storage (Morton , 2005) space is considered worthless evidence to prosecute suspected offenders .
In fact , large amount of government grants on surveillance technology implementation can be alternatively invested on issues of greater importance namely eradication of poverty , famine and diseases control .
In conclusion , surveillance technology should be banned as consequences including violation civilian's privacy and wastage of national resources results .

According to a survey , the using of RFID tagging systems and its related technologies in the domain of healthcare will have a rapid growth from $90 million in 2006 to $2 .1 billion in 2016 CITATION Rap06 \l 2052 (Rapid adoption of RFID in healthcare , 2006) .
This is a very good evidence to show that the surveillance technology is becoming more and more widespread in current society , especially in our daily healthcare apartments .
Some data indicates that RFID technology can really help us a lot in saving the patients' lives , preventing errors caused by doctors and providing a more safe operation environment .
Firstly , it can give the patients more freedom by getting rid of those long and boring procedures CITATION Rap06 \l 2052 (Rapid adoption of RFID in healthcare , 2006) .
Usually these procedures require the patients to suffer quite a lot and need many efforts from the attendants .
Secondly , it can reduce the possibility of errors which may happen in the process .
One basic theory is using an electronic handshake spectrum to prevent the wrong procedures from happening .
Thirdly , it provides us a lot of convenience because as a result of the widespread of this technology , some old and needy patients can be cared and thus under safe condition anywhere .
By planting this device into their body , we can detect where they are in case some urgent diseases break out .
"The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned ."
It was reported that during the September 11 terrorist attacks , fire fighters wrote their names on their arms for fear that they would be unidentified by their family members if they are disfigured .
(Kanellos , 2004 , There's not a lot of middle ground on the subject of implanting electronic identification chips in humans , para 4) This news offers us food for thought if the use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be permitted .
Admittedly , the use of surveillance technology may invade one's privacy .
Nonetheless , it is more persuasive to believe that surveillance technology helps in tracking of properties and improvements in medical care .
Hence , the use of surveillance technology should not be banned .
Firstly , businessmen contend that the use of surveillance technology facilitates the tracking of properties .
RFID tags can be inserted into objects to monitor the sales and quality of products .
This would ensure easier documentation of items sold and companies could improve their operations efficiency .
An illustration is a shopping mall , Wal-Mart , which is using tagging devices in its products in order to update their supply chain (Srivastava , 2007 , Shopping and dining out , para 1) .
However , critics argue that the accumulation of data may be susceptible to theft and misuse (Kanellos , 2004 , Tagging hospital patients . . . and alumni , para 7) .
With rapid advancements in technology , abusers can tag on RFID tags and misappropriate the data .
(Kanellos , 2004 , Tagging hospital patients . . . and alumni , para 8) .
This may lead to the loss of companies' privacy if confidential information were obtained .
Nevertheless , this concern may be overrated as Sriviastava (2007) claimed that devices such as 'tag killings' are available to safeguard the information stored in the RFID tags .
Hence , the use of surveillance technology should not be banned .
Secondly , medical professionals assert that the use of surveillance technology aids in improvements in medical care .
Patients' health could be monitored and checked regularly with the use of RFID tags .
(Kanellos , 2004 , Tagging hospital patients . . . and alumni , para 3) With this , the medical reports of patients can be shared and obtained easily by hospitals which will facilitate the diagnosis and prescription of drugs for the patients .
In addition , abduction of babies are minimised with increased security .
(Srivastava , 2007 , Sports and health , para 4)
In all , the use of surveillance technology should not be banned as it facilitates tracking of information and medical care .
As technology progresses , one may expect more surveillance devices to be developed in the near future .
The usage of surveillance technology such as RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) on people or products has been a hot topic debated by both supporters and critics .
RFID tags has been introduced to the general public , but remains theoretical until the 11th September ,2001 attack .
The idea came when a technology executive discovered that RFID tags may be used for identification if a body becomes disfigured or unrecognizable in an accident .
Thus , the RFID technology starts to materialize and propagates in public which causes commotions pertaining to privacy and ethical issues aroused from the usage of such technology .
Albeit the risk of privacy invasion , RFID tags are potential devices which do benefits a lot to humans if executed under strict regulations .
First and foremost , with the RFID surveillance technology , personal safety in public places can be enhanced .
By having RFID attached to a person , especially children , their whereabouts can be constantly watched by their parents and increases the safeguarding of their children .
However , there are issues concerning the dependence of technology instead of parents giving full attention towards their children by their own effort , and thus decreasing their sense of responsibility as a caretaker .
But with RFID tags , their children can remain safe and sound by lowering the case of being injured or lost as the devices can detect straightaway if such situations happen .
Therefore , RFID tags are efficacious devices in monitoring the situation of children .
Surveillance is no longer unfamiliar in the era of technology-based society .
Surveillance , according to Bogonikolos (1999) , is the systematic investigation or monitoring of behaviour or intercourse of one person or a group .
It is professionally used by the executive authorities and the governments , especially the Ministry of Defence .
Nonetheless , the generalization of certain simple surveillance technologies causes their existence to be found everywhere .
Although surveillance can be utilized widely in the aspects of health and medical , protection against terrorist attack and security purposes , abuse usage of such technology will bring us negative impacts .
Thus , in my opinion , surveillance should be banned under certain circumstances .
There is much controversy raised on the disadvantages of surveillance technology nowadays , particularly in term of privacy .
Privacy can be defined as "the condition of not having undocumented personal knowledge about one possessed by others" .
(D . Moore , 2000 , p .698) Recently , home surveillance becomes more well-liked among nuclear families .
Since most couples in this competitive era have their own business or enterprise , home surveillance is then installed in order to guard their residence .
However , this might cause severe effect in which home and individual privacies are invaded once the mechanism is hacked with a little technical skill .
Besides that , even though camera surveillance used in educational institutions is purposely to secure the safety of students , "the majority of the schemes evaluated did not reduce crime and even where there was a reduction this was mostly not due to CCTV; nor did CCTV schemes make people feel safer , much less change their behaviour ."
(Gill & Spriggs , 2005 , p .115) As a result , the setup of CCTV not only dissipates the expenditure , but also reduces the freedom space of students .
On the other hand , surveillance technology also influences the psychological condition of individuals .
For instance , installation of surveillance technology in workplaces more or less will lower the task performance of employees .
While monitoring the employees with video surveillance along working , they may feel uneasy on their movements .
At the same time , monitoring also reduces the liability between employers and employees , and results in the decrease in morale in the latter .
(Bryant , 2006 , para .11)
In conclusion , the effects of surveillance technology surrounding us are based on both major and minor premises , which are privacy and right of freedom of individuals , as well as the psychological condition .
Hence , these have strengthened our standpoint that surveillance technology should be banned .

Rapidly rising availability of surveillance technology have made it possible to yield information about the locations of people .
This has raised issues concerning the collection , use and disclosure of personal data .
Nonetheless , the use of surveillance technology adds convenience and offers opportunities for improvement in our daily lives , from personal safety to health .
Due to the potential technological benefits which could impact human lives , it should not be banned .
Although the use of surveillance technology may lead to undesirable implications , they are highly unlikely to happen .
Some opponents of surveillance technology have argued that its use would invade their privacy and the information might also be distributed to unauthorised parties without consent (Srivastava , 2007 , para .
31) .
However , a series of technical countermeasures , policies and regulatory initiatives had been introduced to minimise and possibly prevent these adverse effects (Srivastava , 2007 , para .
35) .
Hence , the use of surveillance technology to track people would still be effective and beneficial in our society , as long as the appropriate approaches are applied .
In conclusion , the use of surveillance technology would be constructive to many aspects of our daily life as the benefits far outweigh the societal concerns .
As a result , the use of surveillance technology to track people should not be banned .

The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned
RFID , security cameras , Global Positioning Systems (GPS) on mobile phone and some eavesdropping device are some of the common surveillance gadget used by the FBI and police .
In the 20th centaury , the best weapon against terrorism is no longer bullets and bomb , the focus is to prevent criminal activities before it happens , hence , information is the key .
(Piller & Lichtblau , July29 2002)
Surveillance technology can also be used in the medical fields .
Presbyterian Hospital in Charlotte , North Carolina came out with a RFID infant protection system where a RFID chips was tagged onto the infant .
(Two Stories Highlight the RFID Debate , July19 2005) The security system will sound off if the infant was being illegally removed from the nursery .
This system successfully recovered a kidnapped infant by using RFID signal on the tagged baby to track its location .
GPS chip was also placed on Alzheimer's patient shoes to track their whereabouts .
Patient with this disease can be easily disoriented , hence , causing them to lose their way .
(Wong , Jun10 2009) The use of surveillance technology can help the patient's family members to locate them and bring them home safely .
From just the above example , we can see that the advantages of using surveillance technology overweigh its disadvantages .
In conclusion , we can impose law and limit the use of surveillance technology but we cannot ban it .
Topic2: "The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing ."
Genetic testing has evolved and is now more prevalent in our modern society .
In light of this ubiquitous and accessible availability of genetic testing , many have started to question the problems that are associated to the results .
The question now is whether an individual should decide whether to release the results to others or the results to be revealed regardless of his approval .
There are evidences that the latter proved more beneficial to both the patient and others around him .
Accessible genetic results are also important to patients and their families .
Patients with positive test results will be susceptible to physical and emotional stress and thus will need support from his loved ones .
(Sharing Genetic Test Results With Your Family , 2009 , para .
2) .
Moreover , the results may also shed some light to certain predominant problems that the entire family may be susceptible to in the near future .
This will allow relatives to start early treatment before the disease develops .
(Sharing Genetic Test Results With Your Family , 2009 , para .
7) .
Therefore , availability of genetic information will help ease the pressure on the patient and also allow many to go through early treatment or take preventive measures .
Albeit many believe in human rights as well as the protection of one's interest , there are many other prevailing factors that tip the balance toward releasing results and making it readily available for the good of the patient and his surrounding people .
Genetic testing is the examination of the fundamental human genetic information , so as to access an individual's risk of contracting diseases .
Although this advance in technology proves to be a significant breakthrough in the medical field , social problems in the form of genetic discrimination could be the likely consequences .
Thus , individuals undergoing genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results as they are the ones who will likely face discrimination .
Employment is one area of discrimination .
Individuals tested to have risks of suffering from diseases that could affect their working abilities would very unlikely be employed by profit-driven companies .
From the employers' point of view , these individuals would likely take medical leaves often to consult treatments , and could be lower in productivity .
One example of such discrimination was experienced by Eddy Curry , a former Chicago Bulls player .
In 2005 , Curry was forced to leave for the New York Knicks after his refusal to a genetic test aimed to determine if players were susceptible to a heart ailment (Harmon , 2008) .
Hence , employers would likely use genetic testing to gauge a potential employee's productivity and worth .
To eliminate discrimination in the workforce , individuals undergoing the test should be given the final say .
Individuals could also face genetic discrimination from insurance companies .
Insurance companies function by collecting premiums from many separate individuals and paying large amounts to only some of the insured .
The rest of the sum collected would be the company's profits .
Hence , if genetic testing results are available to the insurers , they would likely exploit it by increasing the premiums to be paid by the individuals tested positive to diseases , or declining them the policies .
This form of discrimination does exist , and laws have been imposed to alleviate this problem .
For example , the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act was introduced to stop the misuse of genetic testing results by insurers (Harmon , 2008) .
Thus , to more effectively alleviate discrimination from insurers , individuals should have the final say .
To conclude , genetic discrimination can be alleviated if the individuals have the final say in whether to reveal their genetic results .
Technological advances have eased the carry out of surveillance activities .
Some suggest application of surveillance technology is advantageous in the safeguard of credentials , protection of national security and enhancement of business and commerce sectors .
However the same technology can also be used to track people and intrude private information .
Concerns are raised on the moral and ethical issues surrounding the latter usage of such technology .
In fact , the intrusion of people's privacy has become more serious when surveillance technology is abused that such technology used in tracking people should be banned .
Two issues are discussed .
Both support the fact that surveillance technology create risks to privacy that far outweigh the technology's heralded benefits .
Firstly it is said that it actually enables identity thieves , stalkers and other criminals to commit "contactless" crimes against victims who won't immediately know they've been violated (Consumer Watchdog , 2009) .
In February 2005 , when the State Department (US) asked for public comment on the implementation of Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) in passport booklets , of the 2 ,335 comments received , 98 .5 percent were negative , with 86 percent expressing security or privacy concerns , the department reported in an October 2005 notice in the Federal Register (Lewan , 2009) .
Indeed , the fear of losing privacy is a distressing concern among the society .
Secondly , tracking devices such as online behavioural tracking systems can be used to target vulnerable consumers for high-price loans , bogus health cures and other potentially harmful products and services ," said Susan Grant , director of Consumer Protection at Consumer Federation of America (Consumer Watchdog , 2009) .
Nowadays electronic information from consumers is "collected , compiled and sold" (Consumer Watchdog , 2009) without reasonable safeguards and therefore poses a threat to the exposure of private matters of consumers that may lead to abuse of such information for certain benefits or intentions .
In conclusion , surveillance technology should be banned as it not only intrudes privacy but also pose a risk to personal security .
While surveillance has been a part of society since the widespread Cabinet Noir splinter (Encyclopedia Britannica , 1911) of the postal organisation during Louis XIII reign , only recent development in technology has made it possible for the intrusion into the private lives of individuals on such a grandiose scale specifically with regards to the wide scale tracking of movement .
The application of tracking technology has spurned heated debates from both public and private sectors .
The acceptance of RFID (Radio frequency identification) and commercial data mining to serve behavioural advertising has raised concerns with privacy groups and computer experts due to potential of abuse being present .
While RFID has proven itself as a worthy tool in combating terrorism on an international scale , it has also opened a window of opportunity for criminals who do not require contact such as identity thieves and stalkers to prey on countless unknowing victims exploiting the fundamental flaw of each RFID chip; as Neville Pattinson (2007) stated: "'each chip is built to faithfully transmit its unique identifier'" (Lewan , 2009) which it does with no consensual oversight .
Another contentious issue is the potential quasi-legal practice of collecting the information of political dissidents gathered at legitimate rallies by the government .
Behavioural advertising on the other hand has invaded the individual's right to safeguard their personal information and browsing habits .
The web users whom have been targeted by the advertorial companies have lost all meaningful control (Report on Consumer Watchdog; Consumer and Privacy Groups Urge Congress to Enact Consumer Privacy Guarantees , 2009) over the use of their personal data which is often shared with third parties for financial gain oblivious to the victim's lack of consent .
Surveillance technology even when well intentioned has been proven to have too many potential pitfalls to be ignored .
The rise in the infringement of individual privacy by malicious people and oppressive government shows no sign of slowing down due to continual evolution in both legitimate technology and the resourcefulness of criminals to exploit it .
In conclusion , the relative gains in accessibility and efficiency does not give carte blanche for private organisations or governmental agencies to push forth dubious surveillance technology regardless of how well intentioned it may be .
The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
In recent years , development in technologies of genetic testing has increased the ease of access for individuals to genetic tests .
Genetic tests are laboratory techniques used to determine whether a person has or probability of getting a genetic disorder .
Some examples of genetic testing are diagnostic testing and pre-natal testing (Mehlman , 1999 , para 1) .
These individuals should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such tests .
Individuals should maintain their rights in whether to reveal the results of such testing is so that they can protect themselves from genetic discrimination .
Such discrimination could appear in the area of employment , where companies use the results of genetic tests to influence the employment prospects of an individual .
For example in 2005 , a Chicago Bulls basketball player named Eddy Curry was sold to the New York Knicks because he refused to take a genetic test to check if he was predisposed to a heart ailment (Harmon , 2008 , Caught in a Bind , para 8) .
So what if the he had taken the test and was diagnosed with having a higher possibility of developing heart problem ?
He would probably be sold to another team even though he could be a good player .
This would be unfair for the individual .
Thus , to protect themselves from genetic discrimination , individuals should maintain their rights in having the final say whether to reveal results of genetic testing .
Another reason for individuals to maintain their rights in revelation of genetic testing result is so as to allow individuals to enjoy the benefits that genetic testing can bring .
Because of the potential discriminations that individuals could face due to their results of genetic testing , many chose not to take the test .
Even with the improvement of the technologies related to genetic diseases , these individuals are denied of the opportunities to prevent , or even treat the genetic disease that could be present .
If the results of genetic testing are to be forcefully revealed , less people will be willing to even go for the test .
Hence , to allow individuals to have the chance to know more of the preventive measures or possible treatment , they should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of genetic testing .
In conclusion , there are consequences the individuals have to consider whether to reveal their result of genetic test .
If they are forced to reveal , they could be subjected to unfair treatment and be void of the benefits of genetic test .
Thus , individuals should maintain their right to decide whether they want to reveal the result of their genetic test .
