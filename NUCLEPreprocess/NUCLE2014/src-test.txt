The issue of whether to use radio-frequency identification (RFID) to track people has been highly debated ever since it was created .
It may appear that RFID and other surveillance technology have brought benefits to public security and the efficiency to attend to a patient .
In fact , the use of RFID and other surveillance technology brings problems to issues such as our basic privacy , health and the public security .
Therefore , I totally agree that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
Firstly , surveillance technology such as the use of RFID should be banned as it intrudes our privacy .
According to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , Article 12 , it says that 'no one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy , family , home or correspondence , nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation' (United Nations , 1948) .
By using surveillance technology to track people , it violates the privacy of one self , thus it is a very serious offence .
Furthermore , a study has revealed that it is very easy to hack into devices such as RFID cards in passports .
According to the experiment conducted by Researcher Chris Paget who is a Security Consultant at NGS Software Ltd , by using simple gadgets such as Matrics antenna and Motorola reader , we will be able to retrieve personal data from the U .S . passport cards (sixwise .com , 2009) .
Opposition may argue that now passport has a protective RFID-blocking sleeve to prevent intrusion from hackers (sixwise .com , 2009) .
However , as technology advances to prevent such intrusions , hackers and stalkers can advance to break into such protections too .
This means that the personal data of a person can be easily retrieved and it thus violates one's privacy .
Therefore , surveillance technology such as RFID should not be used as it violates the human rights for privacy .
Lastly , surveillance technology like CCTV cameras does not decrease the crime rate .
CCTV cameras are used to "keep an eye" on the public and are said to be a good way of crime prevention .
Opposition argues that with CCTV cameras , criminals will be aware that they are being watched and so it reduces the crime rate .
However , this is not necessary true .
London has more than ten thousand CCTV cameras , however , eighty percent of the crimes are left unsolved (Davenport , 2007) .
This substantially supports that with surveillance technology , it does not reduce the crime rate and enhances public security .
Hence , it is not necessary to use surveillance technology to track people .
To conclude , surveillance technology should not be used as it not only can not help in solving crime and maintain order , it poses a health threat to the people using it and around it as well .
Finally , the use of surveillance technology is a violation to human rights .
Therefore I agree that it should not be used .

RFID tags useful , but potentially risky [Internet] [cited 2009 Sep 22] .

Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is a type of surveillance technology which has been used for a while now .
It works by storing and retrieving data using RFID tags .
An RFID tag is a small object which can be attached to or integrated into a product or even a person in order to track them .
Although RFID has been claimed to be a useful technology such as in the identification and tracking of criminals , the use of RFID has aroused considerable controversy especially in the area of privacy concerns .
Shop outlets , employers and even potential crime-doers can use RFID to prey on their desired targets , hence intruding their privacy .
Therefore , surveillance technology such as RFID should not be used to track people .
Firstly , stores can use RFID to track and identify customers without their awareness and price items discriminatively .
Shop outlets can charge customers the maximum amount he or she is prepared to pay instead of selling at the same price to every customer by using RFID tags to observe their shopping habits .
For example , stores would definitely charge higher prices for a customer who is price-insensitive and loves to buy branded goods .
The counterargument could be that RFID can be used to provide a better customer service by knowing their customers' preferences .
However , this is not true for all cases since the use of RFID for the purpose of better service could fall into the hands of unscrupulous sellers who only care for lucrative profits .
This can lead to a strong incentive to interfere with customer privacy .
Hence , to be on the safe side , RFID should not be used for any tracking purposes .
Secondly , the use of RFID would allow the employer to monitor every movement of his employees , whether at work or not , in order to assess the performance of his employees .
The employees may not be aware that their personal information is being collected and how this information is being used .
Thus , the privacy of the employees is being invaded when RFID is used for tracking purposes including tracking someone going to the toilet .
The opposition can claim that there is an existing employment law and privacy act to govern the employees' privacy interests .
The law states that the employer is entitled to monitor worker movements and conduct during working hours , so long as the means employed are fair and reasonable and do not unjustifiably disadvantage employees (Roth 2006) .
However , we have to note that RFID is a special surveillance technology with unique characteristics and implications .
Hence , some special provision may need to be made under the law to account specifically for RFID .
Finally , criminals will be able to use RFID tags to help pick their targets .
For instance , they can attach RFID tags onto wealthy people and this would allow them to track their daily routine and whereabouts and can thus work out their robbing or kidnapping plan .
In addition , terrorists can also use RFID to bomb citizens of a particular nationality by setting the bombs to explode when such citizens are nearby .
However , the opposition argued that another novel surveillance technology will probably be invented to counter against such criminals .
Moreover , the main intention of RFID is to protect the society since the police can use the technology to detect criminals .
The opposition may not be completely correct since it will take time to produce a new technology to close in on the criminals and several crimes would have occurred during this period .
Also , a vicious cycle will be created by the criminals using RFID to attack their targets and followed by the police using RFID to detect those criminals .
There will be no end to this and therefore RFID should not be used to track people .
In conclusion , the use of RFID to track people should be banned , not only because it violates an individual's privacy but it could also encourage more potential criminals to commit atrocities and to stir up the greed within businessmen .
The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned
Firstly , the RFID technology is still immature which means we cannot guaranty both the accuracy of information we get and the harmlessness of these chips implanted in our body .
Actually , when two or more readers want to scan the same tag , the "signals from their scanners may overlap" which will cause the tag "unable to reply" (Reported on Techonovelgy .com) .
We call this reader collision .
Similarly , "tag collision" may occur when "tags are present in a small area" (Reported on Techonovelgy .com) .
Furthermore , the RFID chips work by using electromagnetic waves , which may have some potential harm to our bodies .
However , people may argue that the chips and tags will be tested before using .
As another evidence for this technology's immaturity , there is no "standard" (Campbell , 2004) in this area .
As a result , the organizations which conduct these tests are the RFID companies themselves .
Thus their accuracy and safety declarations are usually not objective .
Secondly , tracking people may result in privacy crisis , which can cause more serious problems .
When you are implanted a RFID chip or taking some objects with RFID tags , the information about your location , your purchase list and so forth can be easily disclosed .
You can never have a leisurely afternoon , because your fellows can always find you during your vocation .
You can never keep your diet a secret , since your neighbors can easily know what you buy for food today .
The RFID supporters may argue that a lot protecting means are provides in this case .
However , they should take note that electromagnetic waves are neither some entity which can be locked in a safe , nor digital data which can be stored in a computer .
"Coding" or "adding pin numbers" to them cannot stop people from getting them (Reported on Technovelgy .com) .
Thirdly , it is purposeless to tracking everyone .
It is true that RFID is really helpful for finding the lost children or tracing thefts .
However , only a very small percentage of people will get lost .
Similarly , not so many products will be stolen .
It will be meaningless and costly to tracking everyone just in case some of them may get lost someday .
Based on the three reasons showing above , the RFID are not reliable enough to give correct information about the tracked person .
Meanwhile , it may invade the users' privacy .
Finally , it is costly as well as unnecessary to tracking people .
Thus , it should be clear that tracking people by RFID should be banned .
Surveillance technology has been an increasingly important tool in both public and private sectors over the 50 years .
It is widely use to monitor the individual's activities and behaviors , for instance , to reduce theft or for security .
The few examples of surveillance technology are digital video recorders , hidden spy cameras and RFID .
RFID will be focus in this context .
RFID stands for"Radio-Frequency Identification" which is a technology that uses radio waves to identify people or objects .
The use of RFID tags on products and humans had raised concern for unauthorized access and invasion of privacy (Sottile , 2005) .
However , I do not agree that surveillance technology such as RFID should not be used in tracking people because of its importance benefits like children kidnapping prevention and elderly health care improvement .
RFID technology , tag or implant , is useful in tracking children for kidnapping prevention .
Mexico ranked the second highest for the number of abductions happened in each year (McHugh , 2004) .
As the kidnapping rates in Mexico rises , a Mexican firm implemented RFID implants to prevent kidnapping .
Xega , a security firm , offered RFID implantation to help in locating kidnap victims and it had been to proven to be successful as the business in booming (Rosenberg , 2008) .
In addition , a fashion designer Lauren Scott came out with a line of children's clothing that uses the RFID tag devices to track a child that have been taken more than 30 feet beyond their home .
The design was sold in the Spring of 2006 (Sottile , 2005) .
Although the parents can make use of such benefit to keep track of their children activities through a RFID reader , however , safely of a child is more important than their privacy .
Thus , RFID can be use to track a child as it can prevent kidnapping .
RFID technology can improve the health care of the elderly .
Researchers from Georgia Institute of Technology and Intel Research Seattle found out that the caregivers can monitor the seniors' daily activities through the data received via internet from the RFID readers and record when and which tagged items they have picked up (Baard , 2004) .
This also means that the elderly will lose their freedom in which food they eat and thing they do .
However , caregivers need the real-time data and record of an individual's normal daily routine for comparison to identify any significant changes which according to the physician and expert on aging , those changes seen often indicate onset of illness and cognitive decline (Baard , 2004) .
Therefore , the use of RFID to track seniors' daily routine can improve their health care through early detection of health problem when they are at home .
In conclusion , RFID is useful to track children activities and seniors' daily routine to prevent kidnapping and improve health care respectively .
I disagree against the idea that surveillance technology such as RFID should not be used to track people as some of its benefits are more important than privacy and freedom concerns .

The use of surveillance technology to track people had become possible due to the advancement in technology .
Among the technologies available , radio- frequency identification (RFID) is emerging mainly due to its ability to transmit information wirelessly via magnetic fields as well as the possibility of low cost tag in the future .
(Michalek , 2008) .
Even though the use of RFID in human tracking could help to improve on the safety and security , there are several threats such as privacy and health hazardous that we need to consider .
Therefore , RFID should not be used to track on people when threats outweigh the benefits of it .
One of the main concerns on RFID tracking would be Privacy issue  .The use of RFID tag on consumer products could track human in an indirect way .
With the function of wireless transmission , manufacturers and retailers would be able to track every single product and hence help to maintain security and keep track of the sale and stock .
The benefits go to the manufacturers and retailers but not the consumers as the ability to keep track of the products that every single consumer bought would expose the identity of the consumer and intrude one's privacy .
(Hamblen  ,2007)  .In hospital  , RFID implant had been used to store patient's clinical information with the claim that it could help to improve on medical services .
It is very hard to ensure that patient's personal information is solely used for clinical beneficial purposes .
Both of previously mentioned usage of RFID faced the same distinct problem which is third party tracking .
(Hamblen  , 2007) .
This is mainly due to the reason that as long as one own's antenna that have could receive the same frequency of as the RFID tag , he would be able to track all the information .
The other main concern would be the health hazardous .
According to some of the research conducted to address on tissue reactions to microchip implants in laboratory animals , 0 .8% to 10 .2% of laboratory mice and 2 cases in dog had developed malignant tumors 2 cases on dog showed that caused by implant chips  .Although the tests were not done on human but the result is relevant to human as human are naturally subject to malignant tumor in response to foreign body implant .
(Albrecht , n .d .)  .One might argue that health hazardous could be eliminated if RFID tag is used to replace the implant chips .
Long term exposure to electromagnetic fields emitted by the antenna could be another health hazardous that could not be treated lightly .
In conclusion , RFID usage in human tracking is not as simple and beneficial as we thought of .
There are a lot of hidden threats such as privacy issue and health hazardous which we should really consider .
Thus , RFID should not be used to track on people .
Technology such as in surveillance had been an integral part of mankind's progress in the past , and it will continue to play a vital role in the 21st century .
There is an increase in the usage of surveillance technology such as radio-frequency identification (RFID) these days especially in passports and hospitals .
These usages of surveillance technology have in many cases , brought about many benefits to mankind but there is also an increasing call for the ban of the usage of surveillance technology to track people as many are concerned with the loss of privacy and the exploitation of personal information .
However , we should never ignore the benefits that surveillance technology brings which outweigh the concerns .
Many countries are beginning to use RFID technology in passports .
By implanting RFID into passports , it will enhance security and at the same time , facilitate travel .
The RFID system will be embedded with the travelers' information and their travel history will also be automatically updated .
In addition , plane tickets implanted with RFID technology can also be issued .
These tickets will have the passengers' information in them and this will help to ensure a much efficient boarding and prevent unauthorized person from boarding the plane (ActiveWave Inc . , 2009) .
Opponent of this position argues that RFID-installed passport is in fact , less secure than normal passport as anyone may be able to attain someone else's personal information with an RFID-reader .
They further argued that information in passport can easily be copied and embedded into a forged passport (Campbell , 2004) .
However , those arguments are not entirely valid as the US State department has highlighted that many precautionary measures have been implemented to prevent such security breaches from happening (Broache , 2006) .
The passport will be installed with a metallic layer which prevents others from obtaining information of the passport holder from a distance .
In addition , the information of the passport will be encrypted into codes and will only readable by authorities that are able to access the database (Broache , 2006) .
Although the use of surveillance technology in passport may not be perfect , with the rapid advancement in technological research , continuous improvement can be done in order to further enhance the security aspect of a passport .
Thus , surveillance technology should be used in tracking people for security purposes .

Another area in which surveillance technology has been widely used is in medical sector .
RFID have proven to be very useful as medical staffs will be able to access the patients' medical and personal information quickly anywhere with just an RFID-reader (Stein , 2006) .
This enable doctors to get to know patients' medical condition quickly especially in time of emergency and also allows the patient's family members to be contacted immediately .
In addition , RFID can also be used for tracking of patients .
Tracking of patients using RFID helps to solve the problem of medical staff searching for patients that were lost when moving about between medical facilities for treatment .
This will raise the efficiency of treatment done in the hospital and also prevent patients from leaving the hospital without receiving full treatment .
According to Cox (2008) , a study was done by Spyglass Consulting Group in 2008 and the result has shown that the usage of RFID technology in hospitals has tripled since its last study in 2005 .
The increasing use of RFID technology in hospitals not only in the United State , but all around the world is a testimony of a growing approval by the medical staffs and general public alike , of the use of RFID technology in hospital .
One's privacy has always been the utmost importance in our society but the benefits brought about by surveillance technology have been numerous and cannot be ignored .
Its wide ranges of benefits especially in term of security and efficiency have definitely improved human lives when used appropriately .
Thus , surveillance technology should be used to track people as we have to use the best technology available to our benefit .

The advances in technology have brought about much convenience to the society of modern times .
Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) is one of it .
RFID is an automatic contact-less identification and data capturing technology using Radio Frequency (RF) signal .
The data can be read from a distance without the need of line of sight .
It can be used to track workers in dangerous working environment and identification of patients in hospitals .
To complete a RFID system , a tag which is known as transponder and a reader which is known as transceiver are used .
The tag emits RF signal which is received by the reader and data will be captured on the computer .
Although there are arguments that using RFID is invading people's privacy , the benefits are more prominent .
Thus , RFID should be used to track people .
RFID is used in dangerous workplaces to help in ensuring the safety of the workers .
Mining fields are one of the places .
Miners have to work in confined spaces with stale air , coal dust and hazardous equipments .
The used of RFID can help to minimize the risk involved .
In China , mining team used KJ-241 personnel and equipments locating system to track their miners (KJ-241 personnel and equipments Locating system for mining , 2007) .
Wearing the RFID tags allows the movements and attendance of the miners to be monitored .
In the case of accidents , the supervisors can get information on the numbers of trapped miners in the mining fields (KJ-241 personnel and equipments Locating system for mining , 2007) and thus able to plan evacuation route .
This will greatly increased the efficiency in dealing with emergency .
Hence , RFID has good use in terms of tracking people .
* RFID tags are difficult to remove (n .d .) .

Hospitals are another area that using RFID to track people can be of great effect .
Patients , doctors nurses do not need to have any RFID chips implanted in them .
They just need to wear removable RFID bracelets to allow the tracking of their movement .
This is especially useful when dealing with at risk patients with alzheimers (Healthcare Solutions n .d .) .
It will dangerous for them to roam around the hospitals alone as there are dangerous equipments and they may cause hindrance to life saving procedures .
Therefore , the hospitals staffs are able to track the patients' movements using the RFID bracelets on them .
The most controversy issue in the used of RFID to track people is the invasion of privacy .
Products bought by consumers may have RFID chips attached on them .
These chips are difficult to remove as they can be as small as half-millimeters squares in size and as thin as paper .
Usually , the chips are placed at area of products that are less visible (RFID tags are difficult to remove n .d .) .
Unknowingly , the movements and information of the consumers are being tracked by the vendors selling the products .
This can be seen as a form of invasion of privacy (Harper ,J .
2004) .
However , the used of RFID to store information can bring about much convenience and efficiency in hospitals .
The tags that patients wear contain their medical records like allergies , family medical history , current medication which the staffs are able to access with the help of RFID reader .
This greatly improves the efficiency in hospitals as compared to the past when all the information are documented in paper (Latest RFID Development Kit for Hospital Tracking Solution n .d .) .
Once again , this shows that RFID should be used to track people .
In conclusion , the used of RFID to track people have more concrete and constructive advantages that can help to save lives .
The miners are able to work with a safe mind as they know their safeties are under monitored .
The used of RFID help to increase work efficiency in hospitals as information are available easier .
Every new technology has its own downside; it is up to the users to fully maximize the positive area .
In this case , the plus points of using RFID to track people outweigh the negative aspects .
Thus we should continue to use RFID to track people .

Title: The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned .
Technological advancement has made it possible to track people using electronic devices .
This inevitably has brought about many debates on the moral and ethical grounds .
There are views that it should be allowed on the ground that such tracking devices actually brings about many benefits , but these benefits comes at a heavy price; our privacy and rights .
Thus the using of surveillance technology should not be allowed .
Installation of surveillance devices are getting common and it is actually demonstration of lack of trust between the management and the employee .
Productivity of the employee is a major concern of the company .
Such devices enable the management to keep an eye on the employees' activities making sure that it is in compliance with the company guideline and performing their duties .
However , taking such a measure by the management is a violation of the employees' rights and privacy .
It will inevitably strain the relationship between the 2 parties and affects employee commitment and motivation towards their work .
In the end productivity of the company suffered as well due to the drastic change in the work culture .
Many surveillance devices like RFID is actually capable of storing information , and hospitals have used it in tagging patient with critical conditions .
The advantage of it is that all the vital medical history of the patient can be easily retrieved if there is a need for emergency procedure .
That would save a lot of preliminary assessment procedures and avoid many unnecessary complications like allergies .
On the surface the devices ability to save life seems remarkable , but it has serious risks of being abused .
Medical history of a patient is confidential , and storing all these information on the RFID tag/chip risk leaking out these information .
It is actually technological feasible to steal such information with just the access to a compatible tag/chip reader .
It is against one rights and privacy if such information got leaked , and prominent figures like celebrities and politicians are most likely the target of these hackers .
In 2006 , RFID was implanted into employees of citywatch .com working in the classified department , this ensure that only authorized personal has the rights to access the sensitive legal data and images .
The usage of such sophistical technology no doubt preserves the integrity of these data , but it gave rise to the concern being tagged against one's will to be remained employed .
The implantations process us a "quick and relatively simple procedures" , but the removal of it is not .
These chips might migrate over the years or was placed too deeply .
Specialist like plastic surgeon and X-ray might be required to remove the chip .
In another word , if one was tagged , he risked being permanently marked for life due to the difficulty of removing the chip .
The use of RFID for tracking purpose exist as early the 1970s by the farmers to keep track of the cattles herd eating and reproductive habits .
It is still common use for tagging of endangered animals to aid in the study of their behavior in order to preserve their population .
Such technology has now being shifted from the animals and to be used on human; it is very degrading and this act displays a total lack of respect towards the tagged personnel .
As mentioned in the earlier passage , the removal of such tag is not easy and it poses a very high risk of leaking out confidential data of the personnel against his wish .
Hence , the use of such tagging devices should remain on the studies of the endangered wildlife and never on human .
In conclusion , the use of surveillance technology on tagging on people poses very high risk in leaking out personal privacy data and it is an invasion of personal privacy .
The removal of implanted chip was not easy even if one wishes to reverse it .
Lastly it is an extremely degrading act to a fellow human , tagging him like a cattles in the farm , and hence the use of surveillance technology like RFID should be banned .
Nowadays in this high pacing society , everything is required to be precise .
Managers want their employees' location at anytime , retailers need information of customers in the store and policeman need identification of the suspicious at the spot .
Therefore , with the emergency of surveillance technology such as RFID , which allows automatic identification of objects , animals or people by incorporating a small electronic chip on its "host"(Europe's Information Society , n .d .) , people's accurate location can be tracked and returned in time .
This results in furious debate in the society since it brings the potential problems about privacy .
However , since the surveillance technology can not only help companies to keep their effectiveness but also assist to secure public safety .
Hence , the use of surveillance technology such as RFID should be necessary .
Another reason of using surveillance technology such as RFID to track people is that it can help to prevent crimes .
On important occasions , when there are a large number of people involved , it is nearly impossible for police and security stuffs to identify the criminals when crime occurs .
However , with the help of the surveillance technology , policeman can identify the crinimals very fast and catch them or pay attention to the suspicious at very first to prevent the crime before it can be committed .
In this way , such technology like RFID can be used to keep public safety .
While those who are against the surveillance technology insist that tracking people with RFID is a kind of intrusion to privacy and it shows disrespect to the individual .
They argue that the potential threaten of RFID is substantial since it contains so much private information , therefore , if abusing RFID will lead to a serious consequence .
However , legislation is already in place national level and data protection authorities have been established to safeguard the unauthorized use of personal data(RFID Consultation , n .d .) .
Furthermore , the authorities have elaborated working documents on Data protection Issues about RFID to rigorously guide RFID deployers on application(RFID Consultation , n .d .) .
Therefore , the data acquired from individuals with RFID will be safely kept to ensure the privacy of the individual .
As the application of surveillance technology such as RFID becoming more common and widespread , the community raised an issue of tracking people using these surveillance technologies will harm human rights .
However , I think that the benefits of such surveillance technologies outweigh its cost of intruding human's privacy .
These technologies are beneficial in medical field , social security and natural disaster rescue or investigation .
There are several applications of surveillance technologies in medical field .
One of them is implanting a RFID chip which contains the medical record of the patient in their body .
This RFID chip plays an important role to let the doctors to access to the patients' medical information when the patients are incapable to communicate ( Ahuja ,A . , 2006 ) .
With this easy access to patients' medical information , the fatality rate due to lack of information available to medical personnel will be reduced dramatically .
A solid example for the benefit of surveillance technology in medical field is the implanting of RFID chip into Alzheimer patients ( Swedberg ,C . , 2009) .
With the help of the chip implanted in these patients , medical personnel will encounter less difficulty in understanding the patients' medical information even if the patients' suffer from loss of memory due to the disease .
Furthermore , surveillance technologies also can be used to improve the social security .
Equipped with these surveillance technologies , our family member can locate us easily and hence decrease the kidnapping rate .
This application is proven to be effective when the Mexican Agency tried to use these surveillance technologies to curb the kidnapping epidemic in the country .
In the same time , United States also implemented the usage of surveillance technologies in their prison to control the violence rate .
The 60% decrease in the violence rate in these prisons proved that surveillance technology is effective in preventing the violence from happening ( {Kanellos}[HYPERLINK: mailto:michael .kanellos@cnet .com] ,M . , 2004) .
Thus , surveillance technologies in tracking people might be a good alternative in preventing criminal act from happening .
In addition , these surveillance technologies are also very effective during the rescue operation or investigation .
Implanted RFID chip can help the rescue team or investigation team to identify the deceased in case they are disfigured or trapped .
As an example , the during the 911 incident rescue operations , the firefighters wrote their badge numbers on their arms so that they could be identified in case they are disfigured or trapped( {Kanellos}[HYPERLINK: mailto:michael .kanellos@cnet .com] ,M . , 2004) .
Thus , it will be much more convenient effective if these firefighters have implanted RFID chip which record their information .
It is no doubt that there are disadvantages in using surveillance technologies in tracking people .
However , surveillance technology is a tool; all technologies can be used in positive or negative way .
Just like the drugs , it can be used as poison but in the same time it is the medicine .
Although applying surveillance technology on people might lead harming human rights , we can minimise this situation by raising the security level of these RFID chip by encrypting the information it contains .
In conclusion , surveillance technology on people is like a double-edge sword .
We have to use it carefully to utilise it to the maximum in the medical field , improving social security and assists in rescues or investigation operations .
With the advances in technology , the use of surveillance technology is inevitable .
This results in the controversy on whether surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) should be banned as it invades privacy .
However , surveillance technology also has its benefits such as security , safety and work efficiency .
Thus , I do not agree that surveillance technology should not be used to track people as the benefits outweigh the problems .
Surveillance technology helps to ensure security in the society .
It is useful in anti-terrorism .
Surveillance technology can be used to track the movement of the terrorists and arrest them before they cause greater damage to the society .
In New York , a group of men are under surveillance as they are suspected in a plot to use homemade bombs to attack New York City commuter trains (Hays & Barrett , 2009) .
With surveillance technology , such incident can be prevented .
Thus , this results in a better security in the society .
Therefore , surveillance technology should be used to track people such as terrorists to ensure better security .
Surveillance technology results in safety in the medical sector .
RFID can be used to monitor patients with Alzheimer's diseases .
This reduces the risk of these patients getting lost .
RFID will able to track their location and find them .
This reduces the chance of patients getting themselves into danger .
Another advantage is that RFID can ensure the safety of infants .
For example , on July 15 , 2005 , with the use of RFID in infant protection system , a baby was prevented from being abducted at Presbyterian Hospital in Charlotte , North Carolina .
An alarm will be triggered if the infant should not be leaving the specific area .
Thus , surveillance technology should be used to track patients and infants to ensure safety .
Surveillance technology can help to increase work efficiency .
In works that involve delivery , RFID can be used to ensure that employees do not go to any unauthorised places or misuse the vehicles during work .
Similar situation can be seen in the military vehicles in Singapore .
The movement of the vehicles are tracked to ensure that soldiers follow their tasks and do not misuse the vehicles for other personal reasons .
Critics of this position claim that it is invading their freedom .
However , during working hours , employees should be following their work .
They should not misuse the vehicles unless it is an emergency .
Thus , surveillance technology should be used to track people to increase work efficiency .
Opponents of surveillance technology argue that surveillance technology invades privacy .
As a result , surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
This argument is insufficient as security and safety are more important than privacy .
Privacy should be compromise for security and safety .
Hence , surveillance technology should be used to track people to allow better security and safety .
In conclusion , surveillance technology results in better security , safety and increases work efficiency .
The benefits of surveillance technology outweigh the problems .
Therefore , I do not agree that surveillance technology should not be used to track people .
Humans have many basic needs and one of them is to have an environment that can sustain their lives .
Our current population is 6 billion people and it is still growing exponentially .
This will , if not already , caused problems as there are very limited spaces for us .
The solution can be obtain by using technology to achieve a better usage of space that we have and resolve the problems in lands that inhospitable such as desserts and swamps .
Identification has become more and more important in our society .
Thanks to biometric identification , nowadays , we can open a locked door without keys , withdraw money from the bank without entering password , and travel around the world without taking various cards .
Biometrics , by definition , refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics .
These characteristics include fingerprints , eye retinas and irises , voice patterns , facial patterns and hand measurements .
Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification , this technology is also shaped by three social factors , namely , the desire of the society for safety , convenience and economy .
Safety is one of the crucial problems that many countries and companies concern .
On one hand more and more virus and hack can access personal computers , so the secret data and documents may be stolen .
On the other hand , some important departments need strict administration to their members to avoid information leaks .
The United States Department of Defense (DoD) {Common Access Card}[HYPERLINK: http://en .wikipedia .org/wiki/Common_Access_Card] is a successful use of biometric identification .
This card contains biometric data to add security and reduce the risk of falsification (Ben , 2008) .
As we can see , the biometric identification involved in important secure areas is designed to identify human with accuracy and reliability .
Besides safety , convenience is also desirable for identifications .
We do not want to spend time and effort to remember password , neither do we want to carry any cards or equipments to show our identification .
For government and other organizations , they are also looking for small size equipments and time-saving progress of identification .
Therefore nowadays the biometric identification progress is designed to be very quick , and the equipments can be easily set up or can be combined with other equipments .
We can have fingerprint verification reader combined with built-in smartcard reader , and it only takes seconds to verify one's identification .
The effects of the use of biometric identification are obvious .
With biometric identification , our fingers , faces and even eyes become our identification .
This technology is widely used in our society and it brings benefit to the government , the military , business and every individual .
All in all , biometric identification achieves great development as human seek for better information protection , easier life style and greater economic profit , and it benefits much to those who shaped it .
Nuclear technology had come a long way since Ernest Rutherford first split the atom in 1917 .
The subsequent realization that the additional neutrons produced from fission reaction can induce a nuclear chain reaction sparked off widespread interest in nuclear technology .
Since then , nuclear technology had been through wars , arms races and had found many applications in the medical , industrial and energy fields .
When uranium fission was discovered in 1938 , it sparked widespread scientific interest due to the massive amount of energy released by the reaction .
However most American physicists were still skeptical that it could be turned into a bomb or an energy source .
However , with the world on the brink of war , military considerations would accelerate the development of nuclear technology beyond the imagination of the initial skeptics .
Following fears that Nazi Germany was developing nuclear weaponry , the Manhattan Project was initiated in the United States .
The project eventually grew to include over thirty sites across America dedicated to nuclear research .
The research effort culminated in "Fat Man" and "Little Boy" , two atomic bombs that were dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima respectively .
Although wartime nuclear research brought about nothing but devastation and death , President Eisenhower's "Atoms for Peace" speech would set the world off on the road of peaceful pursuit of nuclear energy .
The development of nuclear technology was also heavily influenced by public opinion , especially after disastrous accidents occurred in nuclear power stations .
The steady growth of nuclear power in the 1960s was hampered by the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in 1979 and the growing voices of the anti-nuclear movement .
The leakage of radioactive gas into the atmosphere prompted the many anti-nuclear demonstrations that sprung up across the America in the following months .
Although the reactor was eventually cleaned up and decontaminated , the damaged dealt to nuclear power was irreversible and caused its subsequent decline .
This is especially evident in the steady drop of the number of nuclear reactors built , a statistic that was rising prior to the accident .
With rising oil prices and growing concerns of global warming , countries are looking to nuclear power to solve the energy needs of tomorrow .
China , the factory of the world , consumes phenomenal amounts of energy to fuel its economic growth .
To partly offset this gigantic demand for energy , China had launched an ambitious program to produce 16% of its electricity from nuclear power by 2030 .
This endeavor to produce more nuclear power have stimulated the development of safer designs of nuclear reactors .
One example is the Pebble Bed reactor , an innovative design that is being actively researched in China .
Safety concerns characterized the basic concept of the Pebble Bed reactor with its passive safety design .
In this design , nuclear fuels are contained in spheres or 'pebbles' of graphite .
Hence the nuclear fuels are contained in a more stable environment .
When machinery failure occurs and reactor temperature increase to extremely high levels , the reactor does not undergo a meltdown or explode , instead temperature just stays at the high level until the heat can be dissipated or cooled by coolant liquids .
In conclusion , nuclear technology development had always been driven by social factors .
World War 2 had given it momentum in its initial research , but it will be mankind's need for a renewable and environmentally friendly energy source that will drive nuclear technology's future developments .
Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas which is trapping heat within the Earth .
As such , global surface temperature has risen by 0 .74 degree Celsius for the past century .
Global warming has brought along devastating problems which will affect the lives of many if ignored .
Engineering can help to address this issue by designing technologies which are capable of producing little or no carbon dioxide .
According to Khandani's article on 'Engineering design process'1 , there are five steps to designing processes .
First of all , we have to define the problem .
One of the main causes of global warming is the excessive release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere .
To reduce heat trap within the atmosphere , carbon dioxide level has to be reduced .
Engineers will have to design technologies which keep carbon dioxide emission to the minimum .
Presently in the market , there are already technologies which can replace present day equipments and emit less carbon dioxide .
However these products are not manufactured in large quantities due to high cost of production and low demand .
As such , engineers will have to design technological products which are able to keep both carbon dioxide emission and cost to the minimum , yet perform as efficiently as the present day products .
Second , engineers have to gather relevant information to assist them in generating ideas to tackle the problem .
As the subject has been discussed for quite some time , relevant information are readily available on the internet and articles in magazines and newspapers .
Third , engineers have to generate multiple solutions to solve the problem .
These solutions may be generated by analyzing existing products to find out how the weaknesses can be improved while retaining the strength .
We must also value-add the product to make it even more attractive .
On top of that , engineers can also obtain a variety of similar products and analyze them together .
Constantly combining ideas will result in better solutions being formulated .
Fourth , engineers have to analyze all the solutions which they have generated and apply professional knowledge to decide on a solution .
Engineers will have to use their technical knowledge to analyze the feasibility of the solutions .
They will then analyze the solutions in the economic and social aspects .
These products have to be sold in the market hence consumers must be convinced that these environmentally friendly products are as good as the present equipment in terms of performance and cost .
Therefore careful analysis of the product has to be made before selecting a solution for testing and implementation .
Last of all , engineers have to test and implement the solution which was selected in the previous step .
According Khandani's article , engineers can test the solution by prototyping or concurrent engineering .
Prototyping involves constructing the prototype and testing it under real conditions .
Full scale production will not take place until extensive testing has been done .
Concurrent engineering requires a prototype to be constructed and the design is fine-tuned along the process .
However this tedious process is made easy through modern computer-aided design , analysis , and manufacturing software .
These computer simulations take significantly shorter time hence it is a preferred choice as it means that the product can be sold in the market in a shorter period of time .
Through the five designing steps , a process can be designed to meet the need to decrease carbon dioxide level .
Engineers design products or systems that meet human needs .
One current human need that should be given priority is the search for renewable resources .
Everywhere in the world , fuel is used extensively .
From large scale power generators to the basic cooking at our homes , fuel is essential for all of these to happen and work .
Research had shown that fuel consumption had increased twenty percent over the last decade , and had projected that the depletion of fuels is drawing .
In addition , burning of fuels emit various harmful gases pollute our fragile environment .
These green house gases are the main cause to worldwide global warming which give rise to further catastrophes such as the rise in global temperature etc .
Engineers around the world had already started on working on this problem .
To guide them in this heavy responsibility of saving the earth , they use a set of simple steps which guide them in engineering a remedy , known as the Engineering Design Process .
This process consists of five major steps , mainly defining the problem , researching on information pertaining to the problem , brainstorming of ideas , filtering of the ideas , and lastly implementing it .
Firstly , we can define this worldwide problem as the search of alternative resources to the existing near-depletion fuels .
Since fuels are non renewable and emit so much harmful gases , the alternatives that we are looking for should be a renewable one and not emit harmful pollutants .
Next , we have to gather relevant information about the problem so that we are able to ensure that the solution we are looking for is able to solve the problem directly .
Studies had shown that an average of 2 lbs (pounds) of fuel is needed to produce 1kilowatt of power .
In addition , we realized that burning of fuels produce the large amount of greenhouse gases .
Thus , the alternative resources we are searching for must be able to produce this large amount of energy to replace fuels , as well as not emitting that huge amount of harmful gases .
After identifying the important factors , engineers proceed on their search for solutions .
They will generate and brainstorm innovative ideas .
Alternatives such as the use of water energy and wind energy are some examples .
With these ideas , we have to analyse and weigh the advantages and disadvantages of them .
An example is water which is a good renewable resource and is plentiful .
However , water energy can only be a small option due to the feasibility .
This is because a large body of water is needed to harness the same energy produced by a small amount of fuel .
All the solutions will be thoroughly analysed by the engineers before coming to a conclusion .
Lastly , the engineers will put their solution to test and ensure that the solution is able to solve the problem .
As such , engineers made use wind turbines and water hydraulic generators to harness the wind and water energy respectively .
It may not be the best option but both sources are renewable and are able to be used to slow down the depleting resource - fuel .
This had shown that the engineering design process is essential in solving problems and it ensures that the problem is thoroughly looked into and ensure that the engineers are generating ideas that target the main problem , the depletion and harmful fuel .
Since the reform and open policy in 1970's , China has been eagerly speeding up on its way to industrialization and flourish .
Although the improvement is apparent , there are still a number of problems hampering engineering design processes for innovations .
Among them , education system and perception of innovation stand out becoming two major difficulties .
Many years ago , the situation is different .
In 1931 , Qian Weichang entered Tsing Hua University , major in history with 0 marks in mathematics and physics .
However , after one year study , he found history not suitable for himself and became interested in physics and showed great talent .
When he appealed to change his major , the professor saw his creativity and eagerness , so he approved the appeal .
After several years researching and studying , Qian Weichang made many great breakthroughs in physics .
However , this kind of story can never be found in modern days .
Recently , a student got a very good result in the National College Entrance Examination (NCEE) , but he did not enter the university which he applied for , because the secondary school offered him  100 ,000 encouraging him to stay another year in secondary school for the next year's NCEE , expecting that he could become the top 1 student in his province .
Creativity is developed by students' exploring through their self-learning .
However , the present education system leads students to another way .
Therefore , the lack of creative qualified human resource seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .
Another big problem is that Chinese people usually do not value innovation enough .
In China , it will take several years for a new technology or new engineering design to be put into practice .
Moreover , many of the patents will never be used in production .
Most factories are not willing to spend money and time on innovation .
This problem significantly discourages engineers to make more effort to do research and design , for they will have little motivation to work hard .
However , in developed countries , people really appreciate innovation .
When a new technology comes out , usually it will be put into use within two or three months .
Therefore , people are well motivated to do research and design , and industry updates frequently .
Finally , great innovation may come .
With the increase in human population , the human race has come to a point where desperate action needs to be taken to feed the millions of people in starvation .
Statistics show that the numbers are only continuing to grow with the existing population explosion .
If the former need is put forward to an engineer , he can view it as a broad topic with many possible solutions .
Some solutions as examples would be to design plants/fertilizers that give higher yield or working with health experts introducing new ways to control population growth .
An engineer would firstly need to define the problem .
Defining it would include a refining of the question at hand to a more straight forward one .
With the current issue being a hungry population to be fed , the definition for this would be that the food production needs to meet the requirements of the people .
The next step towards achieving this goal would be to gather information on certain aspects relating to his "pictured" solution .
For example , if his idea is to produce plants which give much greater yield , he needs to assess the yield of existing plants .
From that point onwards he could design different possible approaches to what he expects to do .
He could genetically modify the plants genome to match with a plant that gives greater product or he could create a new genetic material for a higher yielding food plant .
Looking at this third step we realize why the second stage of an engineering design process of gathering information is important .Once all the information is put together into the different possible solutions , the engineer is put to decide which method out of the lot is suited best for the purpose and if agrees with existing international laws .
At this point also any available detail into the viability of the method is valuable .
Lastly comes the most crucial part of an engineering design process .
This determines how accurate the engineer might have been in his work and also if he looked at nature as a considerable factor during his designing process .
The testing stage is usually either the most rewarding or heart- breaking stage of a design process .
Even though the solution seems perfect according to calculations , there are "nature factors" that we cannot control which still affect any process we carry under the sun .
It is likely that this genetically modified plant was give three hundred percent yield is actually not surviving until harvest .
If that is the case , what the engineer would do is analyze the problem at hand and point out exactly which part of the solution needs to be modified .
Another aspect of great engineers is their ability to optimize processes .
This includes less useless waste , more recyclable waste material and high productivity .
So any engineering process can be continuously modified into a faster , better and greener one .
It is self-explanatory that every engineering design process is naturally a cyclic process .
There is no definite correct solution for the question at hand .
With the many possible solutions , what a smart engineer does he figures the best solution and introduces the best way of executing it , so that the need is fulfilled immediately and effectively .
The process of developing a new product based on innovation is not an easy task for the innovators .
The innovators , who are normally work under Research and Development department , have to recognize the needs from the public or through research , are require to spend countless days and nights to understand the problems , to produce solutions to the problems , to convert the solutions into practical products and to commercialize them .
By diffusion and adoption of the innovation products by the public or specific users , the innovators have to face the consequences .
These are not the only challenges that the innovators are going to deal with .
In order to process from the initial stage of innovation development to the final stage , the most important issue is to have a huge sum of fund for development and commercial purposes .
So , the manufacture company , for example , the company that the innovators are working for , is one of the major investors that is providing the fund .
Innovators required development fund in order to obtain their needs , such as hardware equipments , to work on their prototypes .
But at times , there are some critical situations that happen or affect to the manufacturing company , the innovators somehow get to be involve too .
For example , if the manufacturing company did not earn profit in the market , then in order to reduce the cost and prevent the loss from getting worse , the manufacturing company has to stop funding the innovators for their prototypes development .
Then the innovators have to stop all works for the development .
For another example , during this recent economic downturn , most of the major manufacturing companies are slowing down in manufacturing productions and releasing of new products .
This shows that the manufacturing companies are trying to reduce the unnecessary burden to maintain the companies' stand .
Therefore , this is one of the major factors that will definitely affect the innovators from developing innovation products .
Another challenge that the innovators need to be concern about is commercializing the finalize products .
In this final stage , it is all about how packaging , marketing and distribution of the products .
There are cases that marketing department do not wish to market the innovated products due to various reasons .
For example , the marketing department thinks that the innovated products are not relevant to what the company is selling .
Therefore , the innovated products are unable to meet the consumers .
Another example is the marketing department has set the price of the innovated product too high; therefore , they fail to obtain the sales target for the selling the innovated product .
So , this is another major factor that the innovators have to face .
In brief , innovators have to face many challenges when they want to develop the products .
They have to obtain fund from the investors in order to develop their innovation prototypes and require help from the marketing department to have their innovation products for sales in the marketplace .
However , these procedures might become another challenges for the innovators .
Engineering design is defined as a process that brings ideas or theories into physical representations which satisfies human needs .
In an engineering design , there are usually five steps: define problems , gather related information , generate various solutions , analyze and select a solution and test and modify the solution .
Because Engineering designs are always related to real problem , during the five processes , the obstacles they face are more than theories and calculations on paper .
The obstacles for engineering designs may differ from nation to nation .
In my home country , China , the two most representative problems are political issues and financial issues .
Political issues usually become realized in the beginning and final steps , especially in the last step .
In the beginning step , we have to define the problem in a clear and unambiguous way .
Besides , a clear recognition of the real need is also important .
However , in some cities of China , the government wants to minimize the time spending on problem solving process to show their ability in handling problems and force the engineers to skip the first step or just accept the information the government provides .
And in the end such a design may turn to be useless as it does not meet people's demand .
In the last step of design , political issues also disturb the process significantly .
For example , in my hometown Harbin , the government decided to develop an underground traffic system .
This design was welcomed by most of the citizens and the whole design process was carefully carried out .
However , when the design had been carried out for a few weeks , it was stopped .
The government's explanation was because of safety consideration for earthquakes and some other disasters .
But such explanation was of non-sense as the engineers did not see such possibility during their designing; otherwise the design would not be carried out at all .
Some evidences showed that the reason of halt of work was that the higher level of authorities thought an underground traffic system was not necessary for Harbin .
In this example , there is nothing wrong with the original design work , but the design still cannot be carried out due to political inconsistent between the city government and higher level authorities .
The similarities of political obstacles in both two steps are that such problems cannot be easily solved by the engineering group , in other words , the political problems are unavoidable to some degree .
In conclusion , the two most significant problems that hamper the engineering design process are political and financial problems .
Both of these two problems , though affecting different processes , can lead to a completely failure of a project .
Therefore , governments and authorities should pay more attention to these problems in order to get better design work for the country .
Legend has it that the world is created by God .
This may be true; however , God didn't give us a perfect world .
Humankind always has needs and demands because people want to lead more comfortable and easier life .
So , they try to invent things which could help them achieve their goals .
Therefore , in modern society , engineering has become more important; the role of an engineer is to design a safe and efficient product or a system that minimizes the damages to the environment or brings benefits to the human kind .
There are various fields which engineering plays an important role in our daily lives , such as entertainment , healthcare , transportation , real estate , and so on .
As what Khandani(2005) said , a company's survival depends on whether its products are in high demand by the society or not .
Most companies are more interested to invent entertainment electronic goods such as flat LCD screens , smaller and smaller mp3/mp4 players , touch screen hand phones , more portable laptops , and so on which are most demanded in the market .
Though these products are highly sought-after and trendy , they are not the most essential things to people unlike healthcare products .
For example , a person can lead his life peacefully without a laptop or hand phone , but , can a person survive happily with the absence of good health ?
The answer should be 'No' as health is the first priority in a person's life .
If a person is feeling unwell , he will have no mood to enjoy any other facilities and products .
Thus , one current human need that should be given priority is nothing else than healthcare products .
Among quite a number of healthcare products available in market , prosthetic limbs play one the most important roles .
Prosthetic limbs are artificial legs or arms which replace the missing parts of the body .
They are needed for various reasons , including congenital defects , accidents or because of some diseases .
Losing a body part can make a person's life miserable .
They may lose not only mobility but also self-confidence .
In this case , prosthetics limbs can help those disabled people to regain their mobility and confidence .
So , designing the prosthetic limbs should be encouraged as it can really change a person's life .
According to Khandani(2005) ,to design an efficient and safe artificial limb may usually need five basic design processes which are defining the problem , gathering pertinent information , generating possible solutions , analyzing and selecting the best possible solution and finally testing and implementing it .
When defining the problem , the cost , safety and liability , comfort , ergonomic and simplicity must be taken into account .
For example , most of the disabled cannot afford to spend a lot of money on those prosthetic limbs or some of them have an allergy to the materials used in the product .
Before considering the possible solutions , we need to collect all the information that relates to the problem so that we can avoid redefinition and wasting time .
After we confirm that the problem is real and a new solution is needed , we then proceed to step 3 in which we have to brainstorm the multiple solutions .
In this step , we can do it in two ways: to improve the existing idea by finding out the weaknesses or to come up with a totally new and creative idea by researching and testing .
Once we have alternative solutions to the design problem , we can analyze them and decide which one should be the most suitable for the needs .
Finally , we can implement and test the design we have chosen and if we find any problems , we can go back to step 4 and select another solution .
Well designed prosthetic legs can give a disabled person a new taste of life .
According to the article about an amputee sprinter , Oscar Pistorius , who does not have both legs but wants to take part in 2008 Olympics with his J-shaped blades(artificial legs) made of carbon fibers , confidently said that " there is nothing he cannot do that able-bodied athletes can do ."
This is the proof that how a successful design can be beneficial to a needy person .
To sum up , apart from the prosthetic legs , there are still many other areas in healthcare industry that need to be improved such as artificial kidney , artificial hearts , pacemakers , medical imaging and diagnosis devices which are very advantageous to humankind .
Government should also more encouraging the research and development of these products .
With the systematic design processing , there will be more upcoming amazing healthcare products in the future .
In present days , engineers need to be creative and innovative in order to come up with new products .
However , there are many problems that will hinder the engineering design process .
We will focus our attention on the component decision process which will determine the type of raw materials to be used and the safety of the end product .
The cost of raw materials has risen significantly from the year 2003 to year 2009 and it has affected the electronics supply chain .
We will look at two very important components in the manufacture of electronic components , gold and copper .
From the points above , we can see that due to the increasing price of raw materials , it is very difficult to come up with new products consistently as it is very costly to build them .
High selling price of the product will often deter potential customers and hence result in a fall of profit .
Lastly , engineers must ensure that the product must be safe to use or it will end up not only spoiling the reputation of the company , it may even injure or kill someone .
1"Trends in the Costs of Raw Materials ."
2003-2009
<http:// www .ttiinc .com/page/ME_Materials> .
The price of gold has risen from about US$380/troy ounce in June 2003 to about US$960/troy ounce in June 2009 ("Trend") .1 Gold is a very important component in electrical conductivity and thus often used in contact points such as the communicating interface between the graphics card and the motherboard .
Hence designs that need large amount of gold may not be feasible .
Another component is copper .
Copper has good electrical conductivity which allows the conductor channel lengths and widths to be significantly reduced .
This results in faster operating speed and greater circuit integration .
However , the price of copper has risen from about US$1900/tonne in June 2003 to about US$6200/tonne in June 2009 ("Trend") .1
When engineers turn to other types of cheaper materials , some functions and accuracy of the end product may be sacrificed .
However , if the engineers were to stick to their original design , the cost of the end product will be high .
The high cost of the product may deter possible customers and in the end , the profit of the company will drop .
Next we will look at product safety .
The main idea of safety in a product is to ensure that the utilization of the product does not cause any injury or death to the user .
One example would be the grounding of electronic devices .
When electronic devices are not grounded properly , there is a probability that the user might get an electric shock when he/she accidentally come into contact with the device .
If the current is very strong , there is even a chance that the user may die .
Another example would be the cases of Apple's iPhone .
There are many reports around the internet and on newspaper stating that some users' iPhone exploded and the main cause is due to the overheating of the lithium- ion battery .
Hazardous product can tarnish the reputation of the company and sometimes even result in the loss of innocent lives .
Thus it is very important for engineers to do repeated trial test of the product to ensure that it is free of faults .
Engineering design process can be defined as a process fused by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current on to cater to desired deeds .
This process has always been seen indispensable as part of the country's economical growth in the manufacturing sector .
However , the results of the recent National Innovation System (NIS) survey show that Singapore has a long way to go in its development of an innovation-based economy , especially in comparison to the other OECD countries .
As we understand the relevance and importance of engineering design , we will come to realize that in reality there are several factors that preventing the progress of engineering design .
Firstly , engineering design process has come to incur excessive costs .
Due to high global demand in the world's limited natural raw materials , the prices of copper and silicon have rocketed sky high .
Engineering processes for innovations such as the wafer fabrication and semi-conductor industries are directly affected by the prices of the raw materials .
As a result , research and development in these fields have become way costlier compared to previous years .
In Singapore , there is only a certain fixed amount in the country's national budget allocated of the research and development sector .
It is more expensive to conduct creative engineering research; therefore it is inevitable that a slight reluctance in contributing more assets to engineering design by the government; the reality of the support given by the government is weak .
Moreover , the government has also other financial plans in spending their resources .
Some feel that in these tough economical times , it is wiser to splurge the money on restructuring the economy or providing more incentives to instill entrepreneurship , rather than investing in research in engineering design .
Hence , the area of innovative research and development in engineering is not driven in full swing .
Secondly , the amount of creative people in Singapore is small , which may be a major reason for the hampering of innovative engineering design .
The population of Singapore is scarce compared to other countries in the region .
In countries like China and India , their population amount to billions whereas the population of Singapore is only 4 .5 million .
The fact that Singapore has limited human resource limits the number of creative people in the country .
For example , five percent of the population in Singapore is 1000 times lesser than five percent of the population in the China .
As a result , the number of creative Singaporeans would be much lower relative to other countries .
Although there are many Singaporean-based driven engineering design projects like NEWater plants , much of our economical success due to engineering design is highly dependent on other countries .
For example , most of our latest mass spectrometry equipment used in the area of engineering design is largely obtained from Germany .
In areas of mechanical engineering , our latest machineries are either bought or are replicas from the models in Japan .
The impact on having a limited amount of creative people has resulted in Singapore having to resort to buying foreign-based engineering design equipment from overseas .
In conclusion , even though we realize the importance of engineering design processes in innovation , there are still problems like rising costs and population scarcity problem that hinders the progress of the engineering process .
Serendipity is usually defined as a discovery under an accidental case , and it often results the invention of a new technology .
One typical example is the invention of "post-it" notes .
Serendipity-based technology has some similarities and differences with technology developed through research , for example: the technology of refrigerator .
Firstly , both serendipity-based technology and technology developed via research are initiated by the realization of problems and needs .
When people encounter problems or have demands on certain things , usually they will try to solve the problems through research and development .
The invention of refrigerator was around 1910s as before that , people had faced the problem of food storage in summer when there was no icehouse could be used .
Research and development had been done to solve this problem and eventually boosted the invention of refrigerator .
This is how most conventional technologies been invented .
Similarly , bearing the problems and needs in mind , when unexpected experiment or research results come up to the researchers or scientists , accidentally they would just apply these to solve some other problems totally unrelated .
Post-it note was invented in this way according to Rogers .
3M , famous Scotch tape company , discovered an unsuccessful bonding agent that could not stick paper tightly hundreds years ago .
However , the 3M researchers found out this failed bonding agent was suitable for attaching notes which satisfy many people's needs .
Thus post-it note was invented from this idea .
In this manner , many other serendipitous technologies have been discovered and solved many irrelevant problems .
Thus , it is fair to say that either conventional technology or serendipitous technology is stimulated by the realization of problems and needs .
Besides the similarities , there are some differences between research-based technology and serendipitous technology .
Firstly and most significantly , for conventional technology , a process of research is required .
Research is usually based on certain organizations and it requires some time , funds and resources before the researchers can finally obtain the expected results .
For the invention of refrigerator , many companies like: General Electric , Kelvinator and Postum , did organized the research group to invent and develop refrigerator .
However , for serendipitous technology , research is not a necessary process .
Many new ideas may just generate from daily life , some mistakes made accidentally or during research for other technology .
For the post-it pads , its idea was just generated from the failed product when 3M researches tried to invent new bonding agent .
Also , serendipitous new ideas can be generated by anyone .
The only challenge is whether or not they can grab the opportunity and do further development to make the ideas into useful technologies .
Yet for conventional technology , it is limited to people with professional knowledge , like: researchers or scientists .
In conclusion , although serendipitous technology seems easier than research-based technology for research process , it still requires a lot of hard work to further develop it and one should acquire the essential knowledge before he know how the unexpected discoveries can been used to solve the problems we faced .
Thus , a serendipitous technology can be seen as a conventional technology with less research .
With the rapid development of modern society , engineering innovation is of increasingly great importance to the global community and human beings .
In different parts of the world , however , there are various factors which slow down the process of industrial designing , and China , my home country , cannot make an exception .
Compared to technical reasons , social reasons are the main obstacles for inventions , and finance and education stand out from all these reasons .
It is very complicated to find out reasons hindering innovation in China while finance and education do have some effect on it .
Despite the obstacles mentioned above , China is now moving its focus to build an innovation-encouraged society .
I believe these problems obstructing engineering innovation will be solved in the near future .
In today's context where failures are condemned and successes are applauded , scientists , researchers and engineers are expected to discover new technologies and innovations which are exact and practical the first time round .
This is also illuminated in organisations and bureaucracies , which are structured to provide stability and continuity , being inflexible towards nurturing innovations (Rogers , 2003) because failures will tarnish their reputations .
Henceforth , inventors with company leaders begin to adopt a secretive approach towards inventions and they go "underground" for research and development .
This is termed as skunkwork .
Understanding the differences and similarities between such a path that inventors take and conventionally generated technologies will help us to better appreciate their efforts & the hardships they had to go through in their endeavours .
Despite their seemingly fishy name , skunkworks are actually maintained and driven by professional individuals , highly trained in specific fields , similar to personnel who are involved in conventionally generated technologies .
During the pioneer year of the National University of Singapore's Formula Society of Automotive Engineering (NUS FSAE) , outstanding undergraduates who show exceptional talents and skills among their peers were being selected to work on a new project of building an eco-friendly race car to compete on the international platform .
Having considered the uncertainties and their inexperience towards the new project , the team had to keep a low profile and work behind closed doors as the university's reputation was at stake if they were to fail .
Another similarity between skunkworks and conventionally generated technologies will be that both are given adequate funds and resources by the authority to maintain their operations .
Being a highly classified project , the Lockheed's Advanced Development Projects Division , a American aerospace company was funded by the government to develop the latest aircraft to fight in World War two (Roger , 2003) .
Likewise , the Singapore government has also invested heavily on the transportation system in her plan to build better and cost efficient MRT stations over the next 6 years (STBT , September 2009) .
The provision of funds and resources are critical towards the productivity of researches and innovations .
However , in order to escape routine organizational procedures , inventors and researches working in skunkwork environment are more often abused in contrast to the people working under conventional system .
This is because , with little supervision , working conditions and workplace safety are often unregulated and compromised .
The creation of the Macintosh was the collaborated effort of fifty computer designers who worked day and night under an abusive and aggressive leadership (Roger , 2003) .
On the other hand , under the conventional system , innovators are supposed to abide to strict workplace safety , guidelines and routine organizational procedures .
They work under conducive environment to accomplish their tasks .
To conclude , both skunkworks and conventionally generated technologies are undertaken by a group of professionals who are given adequate funds and resources .
However , they receive different forms of treatments and work under different environments .
This is to meet the society's expectation for them to come out with inventions which are correct the first time round .
From past to present , many important innovations have surfaced .
Some of these innovations were shaped by technology while others were created from the needs and desires of society .
A crucial invention which has eased man's ways of living is the aircraft .
According to (AVIATION , 2009) "Centuries of dreaming preceded the first successful flight" which suggests that the basis of this innovation was from man's dream to fly like birds they see in the sky .
Hence aircrafts were a socially determined technology which has developed over time , catering to the needs of humanity .
Firstly , military aspects were crucial in shaping the aircraft .
Planes of present versus those in the past show a noticeable improvement in agility and speed .
In World War I (WWI) for example , planes were fairy slower and more bulky , as mentioned by (AVIATION , 2009) "Huge biplane bombers with two , three , or four engines were introduced in World War I" .
However , the military learnt from the fighting techniques used in combats during WWI and required aircrafts able to negotiate tighter turns and break the speed of sound so as to evade enemies or catch up with them .
World War Two showed improvements in the design and ability of aircrafts , making them smaller and therefore swifter .
Adding on , fighters of today are even more advanced and able to break the sound barrier .
Take for example the "F-15 Eagle , which excels at air-to-air defence tactics and has a maximum speed of over Mach 2 .5" or "the F-16 Falcon , a highly maneuverable all-purpose fighter-bomber" (AIRPLANE , 2009) .
These planes are not only a mark of development in speed but also in agility .
Most importantly , we see that these needs of the military were a driving force behind the development and enhancement of the aircraft .
In conclusion , the aircraft , a socially determined technology , has developed from its ancient clumsy and slow predecessors to their new age , swift and agile successors .
These modifications were indeed not possible if not for the varying social as well as military requirements during different eras .

When there is a need for something , a technology is create to solve the problem .
The same applies for an eco-friendly car .
There are many factors that contribute to the creation of the eco-friendly car .
The factors are - political , economical , technological , environmental and social .
In 2006 , a documentary film , An Inconvenient Truth , written by former United States Vice President Al Gore , has sparked a series of heated discussions after it was being screened in cinemas .
It sent a message to the world about the drastic environmental changes due to decades of environmental abuse by mankind and what will happen if we choose to ignore this issue .
Subsequent actions were taken by the American government to administer a regulation that car companies could only sell ninety percent of cars with normal machinations while the other ten percent had to be eco friendly cars .
This implies that automobile companies had to pull in large sums of money for research and development work to create and promote the sales of such cars .
Without pressure from the government , no automobile company would have taken the initiative to manufacture and market out these vehicles .
Economic factors stressed the need for eco-friendly cars .
However the cost to finance this project will be high as much research and development have to be done .
Even though it is expensive to develop eco-friendly cars as they cost around two to three times more compared to gasoline powered cars; however this move is vital due to the slow depletion of natural resources for vehicle consumption as it leads to the increment of fuel prices .
In the long run , it will not be economically viable to own a gasoline powered car .
One of the main purposes of the creation of eco friendly cars is due to environmental factors .
The need to reduce pollution levels plays a very important role .
Since the past decade , people are getting more conscious of the damages that we have been inflicting to the Earth .
As mentioned , the Inconvenient Truth has shown that there is a direct link between carbon emissions and the rising temperatures of the Earth .
Statistics have shown that in the past century , carbon emissions have sky rocketed to ridiculously high levels and carbon emissions mainly comes from us humans when we burn fossil fuels for our own usage .
As carbon dioxide "stocks up" in the atmosphere over years , it traps the Sun's heat , thus creating global warming which eventually leads to various climate changes .
Using eco- friendly cars would reduce the carbon emissions per car drastically .
One of the first things we can do to help conserve the environment is to switch from gasoline cars to eco-friendly cars , that is if we already a car .
As awareness of the effects of climate changes grows , people realize that it is their social responsibility to try to undo the environment damages to the best their ability .
Hence more people are seeking for greener alternatives .
Even British Prime Minister , Gordon Brown has urged that all cars in Britain to be green by 2020 .
In conclusion , the creation of eco-friendly cars are shaped by the factors mentioned above and I believe that not only this creation is one of a kind; it is here to stay and also one of the key creations for the future generations to further develop .
In this rapid economic development of the 21st century , the demand for energy is increasing .
However , the Earth can only provide our limited energy .
We cannot increase the amount of fossil fuel use .
Dwindling reserves of fossil fuels on the basis that no matter how slow this process may be , we need to look at other ways to produce energy .
Hence , the use of renewable energy is very important , in our planet's future development .
There many alternative source of energy can be used and applied in our life , such as solar energy , light energy , wind energy , water power and so on .
All of these alternative sources of energy not only help reduce our dependence on non-renewable energy sources , but also these renewable energy power generation processes are friendlier environment .
Currently , people realise the features of environmental protection and the economical efficiency of the solar energy; the use of solar energy is made use of more and more widespread in the ordinary life .
The 21st century is faced with a severe problem of global energy shortage .
Industries require resources such as electricity , oil and petroleum for varies outputs .
The rate of energy consumption by human is much higher than what nature is able to produce .
Therefore , the last decade has witnessed the increasing energy price due to insufficient supply of energy .
For example , the oil price increased from $15 .77/bbl in 1998 to $91 .35/bbl in 2008 (InflationData .com) .
The 479% jump within 10 years implies that actions must be taken to solve the problem .
According to Khandani (2005) , engineering design activities are conducted in order to meet human needs .
In response to energy shortage , engineers design more efficient products and systems .
Among the solutions such as establishing energy-intense industry and recycling natural resources , finding alterative resources seems to be the best solution to provide sustainable supply of energy for varies industries .
To conclude , engineering design process can be applied to help solve the current problem of global energy shortage .
A variety of natural and renewable energies can be considered as alternative energy resources .
If engineers are capable of introducing environmental friendly energies with reasonable cost and sufficient quality , we can expect a future balance between energy consumption and energy supply .
Technologies are always developed to cater certain needs of people , whether to provide better methods of doing things or to develop tools that facilitate working and living .
Technologies are also consistently refined to meet changing needs of customers .
This also applies to virtual technology , which was developed under a specific social and technological background and was evolved to meet increasing needs under a changing environment .
Virtual technology was first developed to address needs of extensive communications .
By the 20th century , with the development of modern technology , communications had been made more and more convenient .
Such excitements brought by modern technologies had boomed the demand for more extensive interactions , not only with friends but also with strangers .
At the same time , new technologies had also brought privacy into people's consideration .
Thus , it was not surprised to observe an increasing need for a convenient and cost effective platform where a large group of people are able to communicate , transcending geographic barriers , while retaining a certain level of independence and privacy at the same time .
To address such increasing social needs , the concept of a virtual world was taken into consideration .
Virtual technology has been designed with a series of unique properties to address the observed social needs by engaging a large user population .
A multi-user online environment was created , allowing a large group of people to get connected at the same time .
This has made interactions among a great number of users become possible .
The user-friendly operation platform designed has made virtual world more accepted by the public and the simplified operation process has also made virtual technology more adaptable to lay men .
In addition , with the establishment of facilities and the popularization of computers , virtual technology has become more and more accessible and has engaged increasing number of people .
The low cost of virtual technology , as compared with that of other types of communications such as telephone , has also attracted numerous users .
As social environment changed , the initial virtual technology developed had become insufficient to meet increased social needs .
Virtual technology was hence refined to meet the evolving needs .
Factors such as the business environment , changing educational styles and new military demands have shaped the development of virtual technology and solutions made used of virtual technology were designed to address each specific need .
The development of virtual technology has been largely influenced by the world's booming economics since early 21st century .
New technologies had made people realize the underlying economic opportunities beyond geographic barriers and national boundaries .
People were looking for more convenient and cost effective methods for transactions and business cooperation .
Catering to this need , a series of solutions has been developed based on virtual technology .
One of them was E-commerce where a virtual interface was created for convenient and efficient transactions of goods and services .
Another example would be E-conferencing which allows a staff to attend live conferences during business trips and has made business process much more efficient .
Virtual technology has also been developed to meet educational needs .
This is especially applied to places where educational resources are limited due to geographic barriers .
E-learning has provided an alternative way to attending lessons conducted by teachers in classrooms .
It has not only made education in such areas possible but also made education more cost effective .
In addition , E-learning has developed a new style of education where self-initiated learning is advocated .
Another example of virtual technology being developed to meet educational needs would be business simulation games where the real business environment is simulated and students can learn from imitated real-life practice .
Such business simulation games have been largely used as innovative learning tools in world's business schools .
Apart from the demands from business and education , other factors have also shaped the development of virtual technology and solutions have been designed to meet the needs .
An example could be the virtual training used by the U .S . army where military demands have shaped the development of virtual technology .
To sum up , virtual technology , like other types of technologies , was determined socially and was evolved to meet changing needs of the society .
The development of virtual technology is shaped by social factors such as the business environment , educational needs and military demands .
This is because technologies are meant to serve people .
Hence , only those innovations and technologies that solve social problems and cater to social needs are considered to be meaningful .
The sustainable development of China's economy largely depends on the progress of science and technology .
Meanwhile , the level of development of science and technology is an important symbol on behalf of a country's strength .
"Innovation" is a popular word around the world these days , and there are myriad of facts to show the importance of scientific and technical innovation .
However , problems inevitably generate and affect the process of innovation due to the improper strategies or methods .
As far as I can concern , there are two major problems in China .
One is that some engineering designs do not meet the needs of market .
In other words , these designs are produced without adequate market survey , so they turn out to be unwelcomed among public .
Though the designs are products of fantastic conception , they become useless as rubbish once out of market .
After the policy of reform and opening-up , Chinese government has long been encouraging people to make varieties of innovations .
Nevertheless , it does not mean that whatever designs can be made .
The key is still the needs of market .
In addition , among all applicants of patents , individuals are the major part .
Individual has an obvious disadvantage compared with teamwork , and that is to say individual cannot handle everything well at the same time .
Without market survey and access to sale or adoption of the market , it is inadvisable to make deigns blindly by divorcing oneself from reality .
No amount of them is meaningful .
In conclusion , China is sparing no efforts to solve problems in order to make innovations real intellectual product .
The principles are establishing a perfect patent system based on the market need .
The emphasis should be put on the propaganda of intellectual rights protection , so that people can understand its importance and learn to protect their rights .
Problems hamper engineering design processes of innovations in China and the effects
Every country will encounter problems in their development .
As a developing country , now China is facing problems on many fields .
This essay discusses two problems which significantly hamper engineering design processes of innovations in China .
The two problems are the situation of education and public policy on industry .
The problems bring some effect on engineering design from two aspect , independent innovation and engineering application .
First , the situation of education in China is a problem for innovation .
It is accepted that Chinese student are good at science .
They have solid foundation on math and physics , they can solve complex and difficult problems in short time .
However , these are just results of long-term training .
China's education is typical exam-oriented education .
Now , this situation has become a problem for the nation that the generation at present age is lack of creativity and innovation ability .
In China's education system , students are only required to receive knowledge and repeat exercising to consolidate knowledge but neglect to explore .
Chinese students are taught to remember many formulas and {solution approach}[HYPERLINK: dict://key .0895DFE8DB67F9409DB285590D870EDD/solution%20approach]es rather than ask questions .
Under this mode of education for long time , people's thinking is limited and rigid .
The president of {Chinese University of Science and Technology}[HYPERLINK: dict://key .0895DFE8DB67F9409DB285590D870EDD/Chinese%20University%20of%20Science%20and%20Technology] pointed that students' lacking of innovation would become the bottleneck of development of China in the future CITATION You05 \l 2052 (You , 2005) .
Besides , there are still many inadequacies in the policy of science and industry .
In China , economic policy is very wide but policy on industry is strict .
For example , investment and concerns that the nation put on technology research and engineering are deficient (Xin , 2005) .
Engineering design is inventions-devices which need many support to gather technologies and solve problems in practice .
However , the policy of engineering and industry cannot meet the needs .
The state only put investment on specialized research institutes .
In the actual production and application , the support from government is not nearly enough .
The two problems would bring some effects on engineering design and innovation for China .
First , under the mode of education , most engineers and scientist are relatively weak at creativity .
This will directly affects the process on engineering design of innovation especially on raising solutions .
In the technological age , since independent innovation is very important to a nation's development , society needs the people with innovative talent .
Engineers need to generate multiple solutions based on different conditions instead of merely learning from other countries' research and findings .
If engineers do not come up with new ideas , they cannot find best solution for the problems .
Moreover , the policy on science and engineering also affects process of engineering application due to insufficient investment in research and engineering practice .
Engineers cannot use the most advanced equipment to do analysis and testing .
Many theories cannot be put into implement .
As a result , the engineering design would be in slow progress and there are still a lot of complex problems left unsolved .
In conclusion , the structure of education and policy on engineering and industry are two significant problems which hamper engineering design process of innovation in China .
If engineers are in defect of creativity and innovation , it is difficult for them to study new issues and make improvement .
At the same time , without enough support , development of engineering design would proceed slowly .
China , for decades , has been called "world factory" by the rest of the world .
Since the economic downturn spread all over the world , China has been regarded as the engine that will pull the world out of recession .
Although China is expected to prosper by a lot of people and countries , there are still problems that hamper its development .
This article will focus on two major problems that hamper innovational process of engineering in China and their impact on certain stage of the process .
In addition to China's low-end industrial structure , the bad situation of intellectual property protection also hampers engineering innovational process .
In China intellectual property right is not well-protected .
People can find pirate version of software in most cities .
There are some products which directly copy the design of foreign companies .
Due to certain reasons , this situation is not expected to improve a lot in the near future .
Since the right of inventors and innovators is not well-protected , people are unwilling to create new products .
Therefore , innovation is discouraged by lack of protection for intellectual property in society .
To sum up , China's low-end industrial structure and bad situation of intellectual property protection are the two major problems that hamper engineering design process in China .
Low-end production pattern makes companies focus on cutting cost , rather than making innovation , while lack of protection for innovation makes people unwilling to generate new ideas .
When China tries to promote engineering design process for innovations , these are the two problems China should tackle .
On September 4th , 2009 , a piece of startling news was popped up and quickly spread out all over the world .
After several years' effort , magnetic monopole was detected by the researchers from the Helmholtz- Zentrum Berlin fur Materialien und Energie have , in cooperation with colleagues from Dresden , St . Andrews , La Plata and Oxford (Magnetic Monopoles Detected In A Real Magnet For The First Time , 2009) .
Obviously , the discovery of magnetic monopole indicated a great progress in pyhsics field .
People may think about what led the success of the discovery of magnetic monopole .
Generally speaking , the development of technologies is always viewed as technologically determined or socially determined .
In this case , the discovery of magnetic monopole was most likely to be promoted by advanced technologies .
However , social determinist , which can be defined as technology is boosted by social factors , is also an important factor in the development of technologies .
To specify , social determinist can be further categorized into several distinguished factors , such as economic factors , military demands , and government policies .
Nowadays it is common to see a person carry a laptop everywhere , which was unimaginable thirty years ago .
While , the appearance of laptop was due to the working demands from workers in company .
During the old days , there was no laptop , but got only desktop that workers had to share one machine to do their mass work , which caused great inconvenience .
In order to solve this problem , a person called Mizoguchi in Toshiba Company came up with the idea of inventing laptop (Rogers , 2003) .
With the help of engineers , he finally invented the laptop that we use every day now , and undoubtedly , his achievement made a great success in computer marketing .
Till now , laptop is still a necessary tool in people's daily life .
One of the reasons for its success was that laptop catered to people's needs greatly .
Thus , after briefly viewing the development of laptop , we can conclude that , the appearance of this marvelous invention was initially driven by the demands of people , and then its development was supported by technologies .
For many years , people have always been trying to come up with some technical innovations to be environmentally beneficial .
Naturally , electric cars were invented .
Instead of using gasoline , electric cars used only battery power , which no more caused air pollution and reduced the cost as well (Rogers , 2003) .
However , in the consideration that electric cars could not travel far distance , and it was not convenient to get battery charged , electric cars finally lost out in the market , due to the restriction of usefulness .
Nevertheless , electric cars is still regarded as a great trial innovation , which still need further technology support to make improvement .
From the examples in the context above , we can conclude that generally , the development of technology is determined by both technological factors as well as social factors .
More precisely , the appearance of a new innovation is initially motivated by socially determinist , and then it needs technological support in the process of development .
Last but least , any technology must be well designed using advance technology skills , otherwise it will most likely to lose out in the market .
According to Khandani (2005) , inventions are actually accumulated on the basis of original technologies which aim to satisfy people's needs .
This is undoubtedly true because that inventions throughout history have greatly improved the quality of people's lives , and people's endless desires have stimulated development of new technologies .
In the 21st century , new desires , as well as new problems have emerged , such as environment pollution , bionics , exploration of outer-space and so on .
Among all of these needs , the most urgent and necessary technologies should be the ones that cope with the effect of global warming .
Indeed , the overwhelming effects of rising temperatures and average sea-levels have threatened the survival of humans possibly in the near future .
In recent years , numerous hypotheses and inventions have been raised .
Among the possible solutions to global warming , the prior technology that should be developed is solar cars , because it could not only effectively reduce the emission of greenhouse gases , but also take advantages of natural resources .
Moreover , solar cars take advantages of solar energy which is approachable .and cheap .
In this way , people no longer have to worry about the exhaust of gasoline resources .
Besides , using solar energy actually cost nothing , which ensures that solar cars could be affordable in the long run .
However , solar cars are still not popular in the market due to the high cost of production and low feasibility .
Thus , popularizing solar cars requires lowering the price and enlarging the capacity of solar battery .
Actually , it is not easy to lower the price of solar cars since currently the materials used to make solar cars are high-tech aero-materials which are quite expensive .
Therefore , in order to lower the cost of production of solar cars , development of new materials is crucial .
Besides , the current development of solar battery is not good enough to afford long-distance driving .
Though newly developed solar battery can support hundreds of miles , it requires a rather critical weather extremely sunny days .
In conclusion , replacing traditional cars by solar cars can effectively control the deterioration of global warming , but further improvements are needed to widely popularize the use of solar cars .
"Air pollution is responsible for 310 ,000 premature deaths in Europe each year ."
("Air pollution causes early death ," 2005) To many people , they may not think much about air pollution because they could hardly feel the effects of it .
However results have proven otherwise .
Which is why , better air quality is one of human need that should be given priority .
Air pollution is the main reason why the world is suffering from bad air quality thus we should look at ways to cut down on air pollutants emission .
There are some current solutions available such as; primary regulations , control devices , increased fuel efficiency .
However , air pollution still persists .
Hence we should look at other alternatives like engineering design processes that might provide a solution .
Engineering design processes such as; improve on battery technology for automobiles , and design better control devices can be the solution .
Air pollution has led to health issues like respiratory diseases and premature deaths .
According to the Environmental Protection Agency (2008) , "on average , each of us breathes over 3 ,000 gallons of air each day ."
This means if the air is polluted , everyone will be affected .
These air pollutants are transmitted through air thus the toxic air pollutants produced from one country would affect its neighbouring countries as well .
Health issues caused by air pollution not only affect the individual but also to the world economy because those who are affected will not be able to work .

Besides improving on the current battery technology , designing better control devices will be another engineering solution for industrial purposes .
Emissions from power plants contribute to over 2 ,800 lung cancer deaths and 38 ,200 heart attacks annually in the US ("Deadly power plants ? ," 2004) .
Air pollutants from industrial sources made up to more than half of man-made emission .
Some of the current control devices available are scrubbers and nitrogen oxide control devices .
For scrubbers , there are external and system parameters that are affecting the efficiency .
Thus , it is not available to maximise its capabilities .
As for nitrogen oxide control devices , the cost of effective devices like the Selective Catalytic Reduction is extremely high .
Therefore , coming up with scrubbers and nitrogen oxide control devices that are more cost and control efficient will definitely reduce a significant amount of pollutants emission .
In conclusion , even though there are many solutions for air pollution available , the world is still suffering from bad air quality which leads to many health issues .
Engineering design processes are able to provide the world with effective solutions like better battery technology and control devices that will improve the air quality of the world .
With the air quality improved , the world will be able to lead a clean and healthier life .

Title: Two factors that hamper China's design process for innovation and their impacts correspondingly .
In the article The Generation of Innovations , Rogers (2003) stressed that the engineering design process for innovation including "problem recognition , research , development , commercialization , diffusion and consequences" .
For my home country , China , although its design process for innovation has been improved a lot , there still remain several factors which hamper the innovation process significantly .
Based on this idea , this essay will focus on two factors and explain their corresponding effects on certain design stages .
The first factor is the loopholes in the system of state-owned enterprises .
According to "Wikipedia" (2009 , para .1) , a state-owned enterprise defined as "a legal entity created by a government to undertake commercial activities on behalf of an owner government , and are usually considered to be an element or part of the state" .
Since the major interest of a state-owned enterprise is controlled by government , a state-owned enterprise can receive long-term economic and resource support from government .
Employees of state-owned enterprises don't have to worry the financial matter and are free from pressure .
In addition , the line between the functions of the government and enterprises is not clear .
Due to the political interference in stated-owned enterprises , state-owned enterprises and other type of enterprises do not compete against each other on an equal basis .
With regard to the first factor above , there emerge two impacts .
Firstly , the directors and manager of the state-owned enterprises exploit their position and power in the company to advance their own private interests .
The phenomenon of corruption is very common as well .
Thus , the money which goes into operation is reduced largely .
Furthermore , the motivations for most employees working in state-owned enterprises are pursuing the impressive salary and welfare .
As a consequence , most of the managers and employees have no sense of professional dedication and responsibility .
They are lazy and not interested in discovering .
Even if employees encounter some precious ideas by chance , they may not want to put effort into doing research and converting the ideas into production .
Thus , the above two impacts will affect the design stage , development stage significantly .
Since stated-owned enterprises play important roles in controlling and leading other type of enterprises in China , this will hamper China's design process for innovation from macroscopic view .
Apart from the loopholes in the system of state-owned enterprises , economic shortage of China's private companies also hampers the innovation process .
Unlike state-owned enterprises , private companies have no steady economic support .
They have to prepare for competition and the possibilities of bankrupt .
Most of the private companies may also lack funding , equipment and materials for operation and production .
With regard to the second factor , another two impacts should be considered as well .
One is the undesirable production .
According to Rogers (2003) , technology requires software and hardware components .
Since most high quality and accurate equipment is very expensive , some private companies could not afford it .
The poor equipment in private companies may lead to large uncertainty in design stage .
This could further lead to undesirable productions .
In addition , due to the economic shortage , private companies may not be able to hire people with high-educated knowledge and rich experience .
Hence , the design stage , machining stage and commercialization will be affected .
In short , there are many factors that may hamper China's design process for innovation .
Among them , the loopholes in the system of state-owned enterprises and the economic shortage of private companies are the two main causes .
If the two factors from two types of enterprises can be improved , the whole design process for innovation in China can be enhanced significantly .
It is widely believed that there is not any strong connection between technology innovations and examinations which is based on MCQs .
However , it still does .
While students can choose either by reasoning or by luck to complete their exams , the same thing is surprisingly can also be applied in technology .
Some technologies can be created via scientific research whereas some are accidentally developed .
Comparing two typical examples of innovations of two kinds , penicillin and vaccine discovery , we will notice some similarities as well as differences in terms of three main fields: progress of research , financial inputs and overall impact .
Last but not least , it would be mistaken without mentioning the importance of two kinds of research on our society .
Both vaccine and penicillin can be considered a huge success because it provides better preparation for diseases .
However , their impacts on the whole society are still different in that: While vaccine discovery was initially carried to resolve a problem recognized before , the success of penicillin discovery is beyond our expectation .
In 2005 , Hisense Company solved the Core Technology problem which used to worry the color TV industry of China .
Now China as the first TV production country can produce 75 million color TVs with homemade chips .
(Hisense Achieves Significant Breakthrough for Core Technology through Independent Innovation , 2005)In order to praise Hisense Group's significant achievement and encourage more innovation in China industry , the chairman of Hisense Company was chosen as the economic figure of the year 2005 .
However , many companies in China are still puzzled with lack of innovative product and many enterprisers are looking forward revolutionary innovation to come .
This paper will point out two main problems which hamper engineering design process for innovation and state their respective impact on certain stages of the process .
Another problem hampering engineering design process is that proprietary intellectual property is not highly valued in China .
People can illegally download songs , software and games from websites without payment .
The inventors of the decoded product fail to gain benefit that they should get .
Since their Intellectual Property Rights are not protected , people are discouraged to put in effort in the engineering design process .
This problem also hampers engineering design process at the beginning since people are discouraged to enter this process .
Recently , the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China announced that Intellectual Property Rights are the power of the development of enterprises .
(Cabinet Approves Intellectual Property Rights Guidelines , 2008)The related regulation and law were also issued and implemented to ensure the rights of inventors are reserved .
The government believes that this will improve the engineering design process for innovation in the near future .
Nuclear technology refers to technology that "involves the reaction of atomic nuclei" (Wikipedia , n .d .) .
It may appear as a high-tech term but in fact it has been put into use in various areas: radiometric dating , food irradiation , x-ray and chemotherapy in medicine and so on .
Yet , as a powerful technology , many applications of this technology have been limited due to political , environmental and economical factors .
Like many other technologies , nuclear technology first came into use to meet military demands .
Since nuclear weapons are of mass destruction , policymakers of countries all over the world prohibit research of nuclear technology's application in military aspect and a non-proliferation treaty has been open for signature since 1968 (International Atomic Energy Agency , 1970) .
However , this act also hinders the investigation of nuclear technology since it restricts the enrichment of uranium .
American president Obama once said that highly enriched uranium around the world worried him most (Lafayette , 2008) .
Due to nuclear technology's special application in military aspect and the complex international situation , it may be difficult for some countries to master nuclear technology and this characteristic is described as proliferation resistance (International Atomic Energy Agency , 2004) .

To sum up , nuclear technology is greatly influenced by political , environmental and economical factors .
Nuclear technology's special function in military usage makes international cooperation in this technology extremely difficult; the radioactive character of this technology causes a lot of environmental issues and its cost in some applications is still high .
However , with increasing industrial demands , oil reserves are at depressed levels; so it's highly likely that we will have to seek solution in nuclear technology in the near future .

In an era which the scale of our industrial system is growing larger and larger , the consumption of resource becomes an incredible burden on the environment and people start to suffer the aftermath for the destruction and pollution we have done to the environment , a series of social issues concerning engineering and environment have been raised .
Among them , the paradox between the decreasing natural resource deposits and people's increasing energy consumption may be given a high priority .
Upon that , according to Khandani (2005) , engineering design of products and systems may provide us a way to solve the problem .
In this essay , how does engineering design processes cope with the energy crisis will be discussed in terms of gathering pertinent information and analysis and selection of an optimized solution .
Besides gathering information , doing a wise selection among all the options is yet another must-do in engineering design process .
Selecting the best solution will minimize the energy consumption and cut down the cost for producing the product or sustaining the system .
When going through this process , various factors will be considered such as function , ergonomics and liability and so on (Khandani , 2005) .
Therefore , the selected proposal can hopefully be expected to be environmentally friendly , less energy consuming and safe of using at the same time .
In a sentence , when dealing with energy crisis , doing analysis and selecting the best solution is of great importance .
Simply by scanning at the item you buy , the cashier can tell the price of the item .
This shows the power of bar code .
Bar code , being familiar as black lines with numbers , is a "method of automatic identification and data collection" (Bellis , n .d . , para 1) .
The first patent of bar code was created in 1952 by Bernard Silver and Norman Joseph Woodland (Seideman , n .d .) .
Through decades of development , bar code has been shaped by social factors to some extent .
The users , especially retailers and product manufacturers , play important roles in improving bar code .
Specifically , the demands of users , the economic concerns of users and the wide range of users are significant factors that shape the invention .
In addition to the demands and economic concerns , the wide range of users helps to improve bar code .
It promotes bar code to be developed into an internationally recognized and commonly readable system .
It is clear that globalization is inevitable which means bar code has to adjust itself to meet globalization .
Apparently , a standard system is needed otherwise it will be difficult to trade .
Bar code has been standardised since 1970s and it is being improved accordingly (Seideman , n .d .) .
Besides globalization , the various kinds of users shape it to an easily implemented technology .
This guarantees that most users are able to master use of devices quickly .
To sum up , bar code is an important technology .
Because of users' demands , financial capability of users and wide range of users , bar code is shaped to an innovation which is globally recognized and essential to the world .
Singapore is a small country , with a small population .
Here , we face problems of shortage of natural resources as well as lack of funding , when it comes to designing for our innovations .
These could greatly affect the engineering process for designing for our innovations .
The shortage of natural resources mean that all raw materials required for engineering design process for innovations would have to come from import .
This by itself poses problems such as greater cost incurred for innovations , shipment fees , as well as a delay in engineering design process .
The higher cost makes it expensive for engineering designing processes hence groups that do not have funding or sufficient funding will be held back .
This is because the designing process usually involves a lot of trial and error , using various materials for different parts of the innovation , in order to optimize the best working condition for the item of innovation .
The delay in shipment of raw materials causes a lapse of time before the materials can reach Singapore .
This results in a delay of the testing of the engineering design which slows down the whole engineering design process .
Professor Seah (2009) mentioned that the Formula Society of Automotive Engineers (FSAE) their first formula race car took 2 years instead of 1 to be produced , partly because of a lack of raw materials and funding .
The long shipping time and greater cost due to importing of raw materials delayed the engineering design process as they only have a plan of the race car but no chance to physically fabricate the parts and build the car , while the raw materials are still on their way to Singapore Another problem which could greatly affect the engineering process for designing is a lack of funding .
The designing process requires a large amount of raw materials for repeated fabrications of each part with different material in order to obtain the most suitable material to optimize the function of the product of innovation .
Even for the same kind of material , it might have to be used several times as the parts fabricated is not necessarily always in the expected condition when it is first made , resulting in a wastage and hence greater consumption of raw materials and therefore a greater cost incurred in the designing process .
Without funding , this step of designing would be impossible especially if the raw materials are required in large quantity .
Innovations which require expensive raw materials will be impossible to proceed if there is insufficient funding .
One innovation which went on very well in Singapore as a result of funding is the desalination of sea water .
Water supply has always been a key issue for consideration by Singapore government .
Singapore has been very reliant on neighboring countries such as Malaysia in supplying us with water .
This dependence on neighboring countries for water creates a need for Singapore to become more self-reliant on water supply .
Hence when idea of water desalination first came out , it was greatly funded by Singapore government for further improvements in Singapore .
Water-technology .net claims that tuas desalination plants produces water at 110000 cubic meters , enough to meet 10% of Singapore's daily water needs(At 110 ,000m3/day , n .d .) .
Therefore , availability of funding plays a great role in affecting the engineering process of designing .
With funding , there can be further research and development into improving the innovation even after it is created .
In conclusion , the engineering process for designing for innovations is greatly dependent on the availability of raw materials and funding .
The delay or shortage in either of them will lead to a lapse or even stoppage of the designing process .

Innovations may be affected either by social determinism or technology determinism .
The UK Technology Education Centre states that "Social determinism refers to the hypothesis that social interactions and constructs alone determine individual behaviour (as opposed to biological or objective factors)" .
Nationmasters .com states "technology determinism is a theory which points to technology as being the force which shapes society ."
Social determinisms affect demands of products and thus the revenue and profit .
Toshiba laptop is largely affected by social determinists .
Its success is determined mainly by three factors: company's perception towards the product , economic factor and social factor .
Besides the company's perceptions , economic factor also play an important role .
Resources and funding are required in an innovation to help improve it .
One is not able to come out with successful innovations by dreaming of their achievements .
Coming out with new products requires support .
For Toshiba , the profits earned from the sales of the laptops were further invested to improve the quality of the later-produced laptops .
If a product has no financial support , it will not be successful as it not able to keep up with the challenges of the newly developed technology .
The most important factor that contributes to any innovation is the response of the public .
Consumers are important groups of people who will determine the success of the product .
At that time , the offices were cramped and there were no space available for workers to place their desktop .
The newly invented laptops were able to overcome these problems because of their small size and the ability to be carried around conveniently .
This convenience increases efficiency of workers as they are now able to work from anywhere in their offices besides their desk area .
As mentioned in the Rogers (2003) article , "By 1988 , Toshiba commanded a 38 percent market share for laptops in Europe and 21 percent in the United States; a year later , it commanded 46 percent market share in Japan , despite the quick reactions of its competitors ."
More technology savvy people demand for laptop and thus the company constantly innovated and improved in order to bring the invention to greater heights .
The Toshiba laptop was successful because of economic , social and the change in the company's perceptions of the product .
It is not possible to succeed with only one factor .
Therefore Toshiba needs to consider all factors during their innovations .
There were a lot of discoveries in history which resulted in the various products and technologies we use today .
Most of these discoveries are made due to normal research .
But there still existed a lot of discoveries that were made as a result of serendipitous result of normal research which always had some interesting stories behind them .
Although these two types of discoveries could both influence the society , there are two interesting differences between them in designing process .
(Rogers , 2003)
Living in a small country like Singapore has various limitations and thus more challenging for her to compete with larger nations .
Several of these limitations significantly affect the design process of new innovations .
A majority of these limitations would increases the cost of the innovation and hence require careful design .
One of these problems includes the city-state's lack of land space which would affect the structural design of the innovation particularly if it was on the large scale .
Another would be Singapore's dense population that affects the location and structural considerations of the design process .
Singapore currently has a land space 683 square kilometers , a country barely visible on the map .
A strategy adopted by the government to solve this problem is land reclamation , which currently accounts for about 10% of its land space .
To further maximize land space , Singapore's structures are mainly skyscrapers with strong and often costly foundations .
This issue particularly affects innovations that are on the larger scale , as large cost will be incurred in the construction of its foundations .
This increase in cost will hence hinder the market value and affect the economic analysis stage of the design process .
Take for example the housing in Singapore , which comprises mainly of Housing Development Board [HDB] flats .
In view of the collapse of Nicoll highway back in April 2004 , HDB has put up very strict requirements on the piling process and the materials used , like grade 30 concrete should be used in piling .
Similarly , the steel structure that forms the backbone of the buildings , require a minimum of 3mm steel gauge at least .
All these may drive up cost and hence affect the design process .
Aside from the problem of the lack of land space , there is also the consideration of its extremely dense population .
Contradictory to its limited land area as discussed earlier , it houses more than 4 million people .
During the peak hours , crowded trains and bus stations will be hard to miss .
New innovations thus have to consider its design rather seriously given the circumstances .
All these will seriously affect the functionality analysis stage of the design process , as more time and consideration will have to be channeled into this portion .
One example of a properly located and well-designed amenity would be the Mass Rail transit [MRT] stations .
Some stations are made connected to shopping malls while others to bus interchanges , thereby making transport in Singapore relatively convenient .
In addition to that , some of these stations like City Hall and Dhoby Ghaut station , not only play the role of an important hub in Singapore's transport system , but also an internal shopping center within itself .
City- link , which is connected to city hall station , is an underground network of shops that link itself to other larger shopping facilities .
Such an example shows how proper planning of the amenities lead to the success of the application .
In conclusion , being a small country , Singapore has several issues that may affect the design process of future innovations , particularly its limited land space and its extremely dense population .
Certain examples like the MRT and the HDB flats are evidence that even with limited resources , Singapore can still flourish .
With proper design and careful planning , perhaps these limitations would be a thing of the past .

In most people's opinion technology can only developed or created via research .
Such as the invention of new explosive , in order to find new explosive Nobel spent nearly all his time doing experiments in his library .
But there are still some technology is invented from a serendipitous discovery .
Such as guncotton , it is invented by Schoenbein by chance .
Difference between these two inventions is the ideas about how to invent them come out in different ways .
As we all know Nobel is a very hardworking and brave man .
He nearly used all his time to work for new explosive and his younger brother dead in a failing experiment at the same time his brother's death had an unbalancing affection on his father .
His father dead right after his younger brother (Nils .
R , N .d) .
But he never gave up and risked his life to go on his invention and his ideas came from his effort .
The story about how Schoenbein invented guncotton was quite an interesting story .
According to Yang(2007) , " when Schoenbein is doing experiments he overthrew a bottle of chemical solution , and the solution flowed on the table Schoenbein found nothing but his wife's apron to clean the table .
After he finished cleaning he thought that his wife will blame him after she saw what he had done .
So he wanted to use the stove to dry the apron .
When he walked near the stove the apron burned without any smoke and ashes left .
Then he felt very happy because he realized that he had found a new kind of explosive ."
Nobel can invent the explosive successfully because of his diligence and the attitude towards science which made him never give up .
Schoenbein came up with his idea accidentally and finally made an great invention for the word .
There are also some similarities between these two technologies .
First of all they are both invented by prudential chemists .
If Noble is not a prudential person and do not do his experiments and observe the phenomenon seriously though he is hardworking he may never invent the new explosive successfully .
From the story of how Schoenbein came up with the idea about the guncotton we can tell that he is really a lucky scientist .
But without the prudential attitude towards science he may miss his good luck and did not go on finding how can this phenomenon occur .
Secondly these two technologies both made great contribute to the industry and military affairs .
As both of them are explosive , people use them to exploit mines , tear down great buildings and provide a high temperature for many chemical experiments .
They are also widely used in battlefield .
Engineer use them to make all kinds of weapons .
Technology no matter it was developed via research or resulted from a serendipitous was scientist's greatest contribution to the word .
The 'Made in China' phenomenon has signaled China's endeavor to catch up with the advanced western countries .
However , the unprecedentedly rapid economic growth , driven by manufacturing and export industry , probably prevent people from discovering the problems that may impede engineering design process for innovation .
Two of these problems involve the special political environment and Chinese people's mindset , which already have negative influence on several stages of engineering design process for innovation in China .
Another problem refers to Chinese people's mindset .
As Michael Keane (2007) has noted , the common assumption existing long among the Chinese was that productivity directly equals to material production .
"In other word , a focus on production and performance indicators in China had impacted negatively on innovation" .
Therefore , even today in China , it is still reasonable to argue that the process for innovation may not be well understood , which means , in the respective of knowledge degree of technology transfer , the innovation-development does not seem capable to function well .
Moreover , according to what E . M . Rogers (2003) stated in 'The Generation of Innovation' , in the face of high degree of uncertainty , these social factors in innovation-development process determine what technology is actually available to the consumers .
To sum up , we are all witnessing the state's transformation from 'Made in China' to 'Created in China' .
In current stage , political environment and people's mindset are two of the problems that may hamper engineering design process for innovation .
Furthermore , these problems already have impact on several stages of the process .

Rogers' first stage is needs or problems , which indicates the initial target or request of the whole research and development process .
It is quite interesting that the initial researching target of the two products is the same: to create a more powerful and adhesive glue .
However , it turns out later that the serendipitous discovery actually has no real target in this stage , because the real use of post-it note seems totally different from what it has been expected at the beginning .
The next stage research is to use the scientific method to fulfill the previous target .
So we can find that the super glue's inventor successfully find what he needs while the post-it notes' inventor create a strange glue that is low adhesive but re-adherable .
In this stage , the difference between the two kinds of discoveries turns to be that the serendipitous discovery's inventor could not meet his initial needs like the normal inventor but accidently create a totally different product instead .
So we can conclude that , the serendipitous discovery and the normal one differ only in the first two stages of Rogers' innovation process .
And from the third stage onward , they seem to have no more obvious differences .
In the context of the innovation-development process , the development of technologies may be viewed from either a technologically determinist perspective or a socially determinist view , also referred to as the social construction of technology (Rogers , 2003) .
Identify one important technology which was socially determined or shaped by a specific group of users and discuss how specific factors (e .g . , economic factors , military demands , or government regulations/priorities) have shaped this technological innovation .
What is technology ?
According to Roger (2003) , technology is a design for instrumental action that reduces the uncertainty in the cause-effect relationships involved in achieving a desired outcome .
In the context of innovation-development process , the development of technologies may be viewed from either a technologically determinist perspective or a socially determinist view .
Technological determinism means the belief of a technology causes changes in society (Rogers , 2003) , while social determinism argues that technology is constructed by social factors .
One important technology which was shaped by a specific group of users is electric vehicles , which had been shaped by four different factors that are technical , economic factors , social , and political changes .
Technical factor is one of the four elements that determine the development of electric vehicle .
Compared to the structure of a conventional automobile , electric vehicle has a similar structure but different components .
Electric vehicle has a lighter weight as most of its parts are made up of aluminium .
In addition , electric vehicle is safe to drive around as it is solely using electricity , while most conventional vehicles require gasoline , which is inflammable .
On the other hand , electric vehicle utilizes electrical energy by using batteries , so the engine is relatively clean , emission-free and quiet .
However , there are less charging stations and electric vehicle requires a long recharge time .
Therefore , it has limited usage and driving range .
Economically , technology for electric vehicles had not widely met the need because less promotion was held and there was a mass production of gasoline type automobiles .
Fewer promotions on electric vehicles were organized and auto shows were not often organized , resulting in relatively discouraging sales .
Furthermore , electric vehicles were not advertised in precise manners .
Besides , declined cost in oil in the past encouraged people to buy gasoline cars .
At this point , there was a mass production of gasoline cars .
Insurance and financing were included in purchasing these vehicles .
In the end , gasoline vehicles controlled the monopoly on automobiles in market .
From these examples , we can see that various economic factors had a great influence on electric vehicles .
Compared to conventional vehicles that are available now , electric vehicles are socially determined in several reasons: limited range of electric vehicles , beliefs and values of the society today .
Because of limited choices of electric cars , people choose conventional automobiles which offer greater variety of choices .
Despite several advantages , their interests towards electric cars are fading .
Additionally , some have negative beliefs and values towards electric cars .
They believe that their status may be lowered by purchasing the cars .
They also feel that these cars are less attractive compared to conventional cars too .
In addition , political factors can affect how the sales of vehicles go , which include government's adherence to this technology .
People lose interests as government is not supportive .
Not only that government provides subsidies and incentives to users , who use gasoline cars , but also constructs and designs roads for conventional vehicles .
All in all , we can easily see that from these examples , many factors that specified by other group of users have led electric vehicles to a decline .
According to Sovacool (2009) , acceptance of a new technology depends not only on technical factors but also economic , political , and social ones .
These specific factors need to be analyzed to work out a better solution algorithmically and tackle the existing problems .

Recent data indicates that well-known Xiaonei .com to be the largest social networking site in China , open to the public , mainly university students .
According to Global Times , renren .com , the present name of Xiaonei .com , has attracted 70 million registered users since it was founded in 2005(Lin , 2009) .
Charging free , Xiaonei .com stands out with 63 .4% share of the social networking site market (Wang , 2008) .
No one can deny that Xiaonei .com is now a big success , leading in its field .
In my humble opinion , its success is owing to both social and economic factors .
On the social part , Xiaonei .com builds its success on the true networking environment it provides , well-rounded functions and convenience in looking for friends and classmates .
To begin with , Xiaonei .com requires the university email addresses and confirmation via this address when an application to sign up is being processed .
This action ensures the true identity of the users .
As mentioned before , undergraduate is predominant among groups of users .
Undergraduate students may probably feel secured , and thus free to share diaries , pictures and updates with friends , which may not be the case in other sites in the virtue Internet world .
Furthermore , Xiaonei .com incorporates all kinds of functions such as the instant communication of MSN , online games and other applications like daily forecast of fortune .
With Xiaonei .com there is no need to click on respective web links and to wait for a while before the wanted functions are ready .
Instead , what should be done is simply logging in Xiaonei .com and then almost all the expected functions are available .
Last but not least , users save time in looking for their friends and simply get things done in a second as long as the information on the school and class is obtained .
To sum up , social factors and economic factors work hand in hand with each other to push Xiaonei .com where it is now .
True identity of user of Xiaonei .com is indefinitely the outstanding social factor , which matches university students' expectation to share their true life in a secure way .
Meanwhile , investment drawn from reputation is the key economic drive for Xiaonei .com to develop .
As a perfect combination of social and economic factors , Xiaonei .com has come so far and there is still a long way to go to prevail globally .
All modern jet aircraft are powered by engines based on the first jet engine .
This was first developed by Frank Whittle in 1937 and installed in military aircrafts during the World War II .
After the war , this technology was transferred to commercial use and enabled faster and safer air travel .
In the context of the social construction of technology , I will discuss how various social factors have shaped this technological innovation .
Military priority during the World War II was an important factor in propelling the design and use of jet engine .
Frank Whittle , the inventor of jet propulsion , was a pilot in the Royal Air Force in the early 1920s .
When he first proposed the idea of turbo jet propulsion , it was met with skepticism by the Air Ministry and was denied assistance and funding from the country ("Biography: Sir Frank Whittle ," n .d .) .
Frank Whittle then continued to work on his engine but due to lack of funding , he made little progress .
Finally just a few months before the invasion of Poland by Germany and in the wake of possible threats , the Air ministry finally took Frank's work seriously and promised funding in Frank's research (Younossi et al . ,2003) .
As we can see , if there is no threat of war , the British Government may not provide any funding at all .
The jet engine will not be invented at all as people then do not see the need for plane to travel so fast .

The social setting of the invention also plays an interesting role in shaping the history of jet engine .
When Frank Whittle carried out his research for the British , a German physicist by the name of Hans Von Ohain had already successfully invented the jet engine and the first test flight was a whole two years earlier than Frank Whittle's (McTavish , 1993) .
However Frank's model was more recognized than Han's due to two reasons .
First , the first jet flight was unknown to the world due to military secrecy under the Nazi regime (Crandall , 2007) .
Second , the war ended with the Allies emerging victorious .
Therefore , Hans's engine was not developed while the U .K continued to improve on Frank Whittle's design , which would later be evolved to commercial uses .
In this case , the engine used was socially determined by the winning party of the war .
Two feasible engines had meet up with different fate due to the different social settings .
Last by not least , the increase in the trends of international tourism is the one factor that allows jet engines to be converted to civilian usage today .
After the war , peace returned and economy prospered due to reconstruction efforts .
People became more affluent and demand for foreign travel increased exponentially (Lyth , 1975) .
Planes in use then were slow; around 250 miles per hour  , and the airlines industry needed a better alternative .
This was when the jet engines were developed to fit into the commercial planes we travel on today .
As we can see , a change in society trend can completely revolutionize the usage of a technology .
This is a striking example of how social factors shaped the way people use a technology .
To conclude , the jet engine has come a long way .
From its initial usage in killing machines to its function in revolutionizing air travel , the jet engine in use today has been shaped by many social considerations and I certainly believe it will continue to be so in the many futures to come .

Since the reform and open policy was established in 1978 , China has enjoyed a booming development in economics and technology .
A large amount of foreign capitals as well as advanced foreign technologies have been introduced to China .
As a result , a lot of factories are built to provide the whole world with cheap and qualified products .
However , the technological innovation for engineering design is still a weak point for Chinese manufactories .
Many Chinese enterprises do not have their own technology and the technological innovation is mainly relied on the introduced foreign technology .
What exactly hamper the engineering design innovations in China ?
In my opinion , a serious plagiarism problem of Chinese institutes and the conservative consumption concept of Chinese people are two significant restrictions for the innovation of engineering design in China .
The plagiarism problem in both researching process and manufacturing process of engineering design is very serious in China .
In Chinese universities and other research organizations , plagiarism is rampant .
A Chinese study shows that "60 percent of PhD candidates admitted to plagiarism , bribery" (Marquand , 2006) .
University professors are also exposed of plagiarism .
For instance , Wang Mingming , a sociology professor in Peking University plagiarized 100 .000 words from an American anthropologist's work in the year 2002(Academic Circles , 2002) .
Plagiarism also exists in manufactories .
A notable number of Chinese factories make piratical products by copying foreign products .
For example , Meizu , a Chinese electrical manufactory famous for its pseudo "Apple inspired design" music players recently comes up with a new product M8 .
This new product is actually another copycat of Apple iphone (Ricker , 2007) .
Another example is the popular Chinese website " Xiaonei" .
It is exactly a fake "Facebook" .
Plagiarism can have strong negative effects on the innovation of engineering design .
By plagiarizing , engineers are not inclined to generate and analyze multiple solutions (Khandani , 2005) .
They tend to copy other engineers' work and become less creative , which in turn , significantly hamper the engineering design innovation of the whole nation .

The world is becoming more competitive .
Only creative countries with innovative engineers can lead the technology of the world .
Therefore , innovation in engineering design is of extreme importance .
China has to be aware of its problems in engineering design in order to be a leading nation in the 21st century .
By reducing the plagiarism rate of Chinese institutes and gradually converting the conservative consumption concept of Chinese people , China can really make a big difference .

Food shortage is much more serious than it used to be now .
According to an article published on the Internet , the impact of food crisis is historically spreading from developing world to developed world (Kate Smith and Rob Edwards , 2009) .
It is the critical time to make some substantial changes to solve this essential challenge .
Appropriate facilities , efficient technology support and proper use of food are required to increase the food production in order to solve the food shortage problem .
First and foremost , government should improve the facilities in the current agriculture system to satisfy the fundamental requirements .
To be more accurate , in the developing countries , government should make a good plan to build irrigation canal and bank based on the analysis of local climate and geography .
Government should provide stable surroundings for farmers to plant food .
Protecting plant away from droughts and floods is necessary to have a good harvest .
Besides the infrastructure construction , another advisable method to increase production is to mechanize the agriculture system .
Armed with machine , farmers can make the most of limited farmland and time .
Having made a good plan to help farmers to produce more food , government must use the food properly .
Otherwise , no matter how much food can be harvested , many people will still suffer starvation .
From the same article which was mentioned in the first paragraph , a surprising fact emerges from the sophisticated Internet .
"Last year a quarter of the US maize crop was turned into ethanol to fuel vehicles - and the US supplies more than 60% of the world's maize exports .
"(Kate Smith and Rob Edwards , 2009) .
It sounds very ridiculous that while 102 .1 million people received food from UN WFP (WFP in numbers , 2009) because they did not have enough food , an appreciable percentage of food was used to run cars .
It can never be called progress but ignorance .
It is an inhuman action to turn food into ethanol to feed cars instead of helping those starving people .
Government should not abuse food .
In conclusion , there are three advisable ways to solve the food shortage .
Infrastructure is the foundation of agriculture .
Upgrading the infrastructure is necessary for food production to increase .
Apart from infrastructure , high-tech technology also can do a big favor in this issue .
Last but not least , proper use of food must be highlighted .
Through these methods , a better situation will come soon .
During the last decade , Vietnam experienced significant changes .
In 1986 , the government of Vietnam introduced the "Doi moi" - reforming program to bring about improvements in the living of its people .
Although progress has been impressive by almost any standards: economy , education , health service . . . , Vietnam must face a lot of current challenges , especially in technology .
Among these challenges , the shortages of investment and skilled workers actually hamper engineering design processes for innovation .
At present , the lack of investment makes several projects in Vietnam progress tardily or incompletely .
Standard of living has become higher and higher .
As a result , the needs of energy , effective machine , modern communication service . . . ask for an innovation in engineering design processes that " often begins with recognition of a problem or need" (Rogers , 2003 , p . 136) .
Vietnamese engineers have knowledge and enthusiasm to start research and development .
However , at this stage , they must face a serious question: "Where do the investments come from ?"
Without money , engineers can't continue and improve their ideas .
In fact , most of those researches have only existed in paper and laboratories .
For instance , despite the assessment of substantial potential energy , wind energy in Vietnam is not developed and is only applied in researching phase .
According to Do (2008) , around 28 ,000 square kilometers of the country's land had an average wind speed of over seven meters per second (para .
2) .
The wind energy project requires a great investment that is too high for provinces; so , they are trying to attract foreign and private investors .
But there are still difficulties for foreigners and organizations seeking to invest in Vietnam .
One of these involves the form of pricing .
Do showed "State- owned monopoly power distributor Vietnam Electricity ( EVN) only pays 4 .5 cents for a kilowatt hour (kWh) of wind energy though the cost of generating it is not less than six cents ."
Thus , the Vietnamese laws would better be changed to reflect the needs of investors .
In addition to the investment , the force of skilled workers is also a difficult problem for Vietnam .
The condition of shortage of skilled workers has appeared for a long time , but recently , in speeding up production process , this condition becomes urgent .
In Binh Duong , a province of Vietnam , the real situation is "roughly 50 ,000 labors were needed to fill positions each year" ("Firms grapple with shortage" , 2009) .
So the engineering design process is short of efficient workers joining in the commercialization of an innovation .
However , in many training schools , there is still lack of facilities and equipment that can't help workers improve their practical skill .
Therefore , from now , Vietnamese government should find a solution to link factories and companies with schools in training workers .
With the investment from them , the school has abilities to modernize facilities so that training condition will be better .
The shortage of investment and skilled workers is a problem needing solutions rapidly as well as lastingly .
Undergoing this challenge , Vietnam will gain more power to catch up with the developed world .
Engineering design processes for innovations are very important to the industry of China .
However , some existing problems hamper the innovations .
Here , a make an example .
With the rapid development of the oil industry , the process and conveyance of oil is more and more advanced .
Just at this time , a new kind of material comes into being which is called new plastic material .
Compared with traditional metal conduit , plastic conduit has the advantages of lighter in weight , stronger ability to bear corrosion and smaller resistance .
In addition , plastic conduit saves sources , costs less and is easily fixed .
As a result , plastic conduit is very popular from engineers .
However , nowadays , there are some problems hamper the engineering design processes for innovations in China .
Two significant problems are about the raw material and the utilization .
In the board sweep of scientific history , scientists have made a lot of discoveries via research .
In contrast , a lot of serendipitous discoveries were made at the same time .
As a serendipitous discovery , the discovery of penicillin is very different from the discovery of the DNA's structure , because Alexander Fleming started to study penicillin by an accidental finding , but Watson and Crick started the research on the DNA's structure based on Franklin's previous study .
Furthermore , Fleming did not experience failure during the study on penicillin , but the discovery of DNA's structure did not seem to be that smooth .
The discovery of penicillin was started accidentally , but Watson and Crick started their research on the structure of DNA based on the previous research done by Franklin .
Douglas Allchin (n .d .) once put in his article saying that "Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin is one of the most celebrated cases of chance , or accident , in science (Allchin , n .d .) ."
Although Louis Pasteur once said that "chance favors only the prepared mind" , it was fortune that have done the most job to make Fleming the person who found penicillin .
Well , for Watson and Crick , it was another story .
"These two brash young scientists" ("The discovery of" , n .d .) spent more than one year discussing the result of Franklin's research and their assumptions before they really embarked on their own research .
Maybe it was just because that Fleming discovered the penicillin by chance , he did not experience any failure during the discovering process , while the discovery of the DNA's structure did not seem to be that easy and the process did not seem to be smooth , either .
After "Fleming noticed a halo of inhibition of bacterial growth around a contaminant blue-green mould on a Staphylococcus plate culture" ("Discovery of penicillin" , 2009) , he started his research and discovered penicillin .
Everything seems progressing normally .
When it comes to the DNA's structure , the situation was quite different .
In the 1950s , not only Watson and Crick , but also two other groups were working on the research wanting to determine the structure of DNA , but in the end , only Watson and Crick were able to produce good quality diffraction patterns and thus produce sufficient quantitative data about the structure ("History of molecular" , 2009) .
In conclusion , scientists made new discoveries by using different methods .
The discovering process of penicillin and the structure of DNA were totally different , but the scientists have made significant contribution to human beings by making both discoveries .
Furthermore , both of them are still playing an important role in the medical field in 21st century .

Over the years , man has come up with many marvelous ideas and technologies which helped to simplify our lives by a huge leap .
These great ideas were thanks to the hardwork and effort that researchers put in to make them happen .
However , some of the unthinkable ideas were not created through research .
These creations are called serendipitous discoveries .
Often than not , they are chanced upon when the researchers are researching on something else instead .
Let us take a closer look at two examples , the electric car as technology that was developed via research and warfarin which was a result of a serendipitous discovery , and find out what are some of their similarities and differences in terms of their popularity , usefulness , production cost , and other usages .
Both the electric car and warfarin gained in popularity from the moment they were developed .
The electric cars were heavily marketed when the prototype became available .
Advertisements were put up in each local newspaper , inviting interested individuals to apply for an opportunity to test-drive the new vehicle .
The response turned out to be overwhelming .
According to Rogers E .M .(2003) , in Sacramento , with a population of close to half a million , seven thousand applied .
And though they were given thrity minutes after the test-drive to ask questions , they find that it was not enough to ask all the questions that they have in mind .
Also , when asked to hand out wallet-sized cards containing information on the electric cars , the test-drivers did it with passion .
They even asked for more cards when they finished giving out what they have .
As for warfarin , it was a big hit too as it was a very effective antidote against pests like rats and mice .
However , to this date , it has been overtaken by another stronger poison called brodifacoum .
This is because many rat populations have developed resistance to warfarin .
Therefore , a poison of greater potency is needed .
Another similarity between the two different innovations is that they are both useful in their own way .
The electric car is created as it does not pollute the air unlike gasoline vehicles .
The electric car is also lightweight and very quiet , which does not produce noise pollution as well .
Therefore , the electric car serves its purpose of being a clean and pollution-free car .
The warfarin is useful as rats causes a lot of problems especially to farmers , and warfarin is very effective against them .
Besides , it is not dangerous to humans who might happen to consume it .
Thus , both creations are very useful in the role they play in making our life a better one .
One difference between the two innovations is the production cost of each product .
The electric car is a large scale project where large amount of money is pumped into doing research in order to improve the car .
Besides that , each individual part that make up the car is also expensive .
As compared to the electric car , warfarin is a cheap product which is easily available in the market .
Another consideration that separates the electric car from warfarin is that the electric car only has one usage whereas warfarin has other usages besides being used as a pesticide .
The electric car is a vehicle used for transportation and that is its sole purpose .
Warfarin , on the other hand , can be used as an anticoagulant .
It is prescribed to people with an increased tendency for thrombosis , the formation of blood clot inside the blood vessel .
Warfarin can also help to prevent formation of future blood clots .
In conclusion , although technology can be created by means of doing research or by chance , there are still some similarities and differences between them .
Right from the first Industrial Revolution , human's daily life is being enriched by exploding number of inventions .
Currently human beings require more varies and amount of inventions .
Some of the inventions are developed from the conventional generated technology while others may come from innovations which are created in a skunkworks environment .
Both of the two methods require tough jobs and their researchers must overcome the impacts of unpredictable market during the process .
On the surface , conventionally generated technology and innovation created in a skunkworks environment do not differ .
One similarity the two technologies share is that the process is tough .
Because of market demands , researchers have to work overloaded so as to come out the technology faster .
Besides , researchers have to repeat the same experiment hundreds of times until success .
For example , Edison decided to invent electric light after Ferrari invented electric motor .
After concluding previous experiences , Edison tried about 1600 different materials as filament with noting down each of their performances .
Besides , Edison also tried to vacuumize the lamp .
And finally all the efforts turned to be success that the first light in the world appeared in 1879 .
In addition , the two technology processes have another feature in common , that is researchers have to take all the uncertain consequences including a total failure during the process .
In other words , no matter the technology derives from a convention or it is definitely a new innovation , it has to be prepared for the worst outcome .
Sometimes the final product cannot reach what people have expected , or the new innovation cannot be accepted by public temporarily , then negative impacts may influence the continuing research .
Therefore , the two types of technologies are alike since tough jobs are required and researchers must be ready for any consequence given by the unpredicted market .
However , they also differ .
First of all , the length of the research process may differ .
As conventionally generated technology is always upgraded from a previous technology , in contrast , innovation is to come up with a total new technology which has fewer references .
Hence , developing a conventionally generated technology is always faster than coming up with an innovation .
Moreover , conventionally generated technology and innovation receive different attitudes from other people .
As conventionally generated technology obeys people's psychological inertia so that it can easily satisfy people .
In addition , the previous technology it is based on may have already gained reputations , hence the majority of people will support the R&D process and the process is always under observation .
But when it comes to innovation , the conditions are quite different .
The researchers of the innovation may receive poor feedbacks in the prior market research , or someone even regard the researchers as idiots .
Thus normally the innovation has to be developed in a skunkworks environment .
Take the birth of the first Toshiba laptop as an example , initially the idea of the laptop could not be accepted by the organizational hierarchy of Toshiba .
However the engineer Mizoguchi persisted to research the laptop in a skunkworks environment , and finally he got the triumph and nowadays laptop is becoming essential in our daily life .
To conclude , conventionally generated technology and innovation created in a skunkworks environment are alike , yet different .
Both of them require endless efforts although they may be neglected temporarily , but they should be appreciated since they contribute a lot to the development of technology .
In recently years , engineering design for innovation has aroused consideration from the public in China .
As a most important aspect to contribute to the development of science and technology of the nation as well as improve living standard of people , engineering design for innovations plays a significant role in the current Chinese society .
However , there are still many problems hampering engineering design process for innovations .
The exam-orientated education system and the undesirable climate in the academic circle are two of the most serious ones which affect engineers' motivation and capacities during the process .
The exam-orientated education system has existed in China for a long time .
It does have some advantages; however , it has more side effect on people's innovation and creation .
In the process of basic education , spoon-feeding education is the main teaching method in this system and it focuses on memorization .
Students are required to remember whatever books read and teaches teach without thinking about whether it is true or not .
Besides , high marks in exams are their goal of study .
They do a lot of exercise so as to be proficient at solving problems in the exam papers .
They gradually ignore thinking and doubting and lose the awareness and ability of creation and innovation .
In the phase of tertiary education in China , although students have more chance of self-study , most of them still focus on various kinds of exams in order to get certificates .
They pursue further study in purpose of getting a better job rather than do research .
Still , they achieve a master degree or PhD through exams .
In general , the exam-orientated education system has affected engineering design process of innovations .
In addition , the undesirable climate in the academic circle is hampering innovations even more seriously .
There are few engineers absorbed in creation and innovation .
Many are more concerned about self benefits , such as social status , reputation and money .
This phenomenon is partially a result of the social prejudice that the society respects those with power more than intelligentsias .
Academic demoralization and corruption are common nowadays .
Money for research is wasted on some vanity projects; cheating and plagiarism are carried out in order to win a reputation .
Paper , as the major measurement of one's achievement in academic circles , causes the situation to be even worse .
In order to issue more papers in some magazines , some engineers even use money to buy the opportunities of issuing their articles .
These problems in academic circle are impeding engineering design .
Having recognized the factors which are hampering the engineering design process of innovations , we must take action to change the serious situation .
Improving the education system and developing right academic atmosphere are essential and urgent .
Only removing the obstacles can engineers develop science and technology and design new things of innovations .
Technology is a material object which is used to increase the ability to adapt to one's environment ("Technology ," 2009) .
To produce technology , one has to make a project involving professionals .
Because the project usually spends a lot of money , one should have a backup , such as a company , to give financial support .
In conventional way , one should receive an approval from the corporate executives due to the company bureaucracy in order to do the project .
However , there are some projects which are not approved by the corporate executives .
Most people will just obey the decision .
Nonetheless , there are some people who are not satisfied with the decision made by the corporate executives , and these people dare to challenge the executives' decision by doing the project in a skunkworks environment .
Thus , technology can be derived from a project which is done either in a conventional way or in a skunkworks environment .
A conventionally generated technology and an innovation that was created in a skunkworks environment differ in organizational structure and time consumption , but similar in the doers and the purpose .
One obvious difference is the organizational structure .
People who do the project in a conventional way should receive an approval from the corporate executives before these people start the project .
These people have to submit a proposal of the project and wait for the executives' decision , which is based on the company situation .
In some cases , although the idea of the project was brilliant , the executives rejected the proposal due to the economic situation of the company .
For instance , Toshiba's corporate leaders denied Tetsuya Mizoguchi's request on the laptop project (Rogers , 2003) .
In contrast , a project which is done in a skunkworks environment does not undergo the company's bureaucracy .
In other words , the start of skunkworks does not depend on the executives' decision .
As a result of the difference in organizational structure , a conventionally generated technology and an innovation that was created in a skunkworks environment also differ in time consumption .
The project which is done in a conventional way needs more time due to the approval of the corporate executives .
Consequently , the project which is done in a skunkworks environment consumes less time than the conventional one .
This is why in 1943 , the Air Tactical Service Command (ATSC) of the Army Air Force gave Lockheed Aircraft Corporation a command to build a jet fighter due to the rapidly growing German jet ("Skunk Works ," n .d .) .
Despite these differences , a conventionally generated technology and an innovation that was created in a skunkworks environment have two similarities .
Firstly , both of them are handled by professionals .
Due to the complexity of the project , an unskilled person would not be able to do the project .
For instance , Ron Avitzur and Greg Robbins needed professional quality assurance people to test the project and professional writing software people to write the software in the graphing calculator project (Avitzur , 2004) .
Secondly , both innovations have the same purpose in general .
The purpose is to improve the welfare of society by increasing the ability to adapt to the environment .
For instance , hand phone is made in order to communicate with another person in the different place in an easier way .
A conventionally generated technology and an innovation that was created in a skunkworks environment are different but alike .
Though they are different in organizational structure and time consumption , but both still have similarities in the doers and the purpose .
Since a company still have to consider a number of factors when making a decision , bureaucracy in the company will not be gone .
However , by looking at the efficiency of the skunkworks , it is possible for a company to reduce the bureaucracy in order to come out with more innovations .
As science and technology develops faster and faster nowadays , more and more machines and instruments are created .
However , machines need energy which is always generated from coal , petrol and so forth .
As we all know , the resource mentioned above is non-renewable , and it is also limited .
Then a new problem comes out .
What if human use up the resource in the world ?
What can human live on ?
So , we need to create machines which consume less energy .
In addition , we also need to find new energy to replace old non renewable resources .
An energy crisis may break out because people cry for energy but the resources are limited now .
The step of industrialization becomes faster and faster , so numerous energies are needed .
As resources consumption increases rapidly and they are limited , there are fewer resources for people to use .
And the crisis of shortage of energies has come out to some extent .
Graham Smith and Hazel Rudge-Pickard(n .d .) reported that , "The UK currently has around sixty million people .
Without oil it could support maybe twenty million but probably less because there will be no oil to power farm machines , no fertilizer to grow strong crops and no herbicides or pesticides to keep the weeds and insects at bay .
We will be sent back to a pre-industrial revolution world with no hope of it ending ."
from this report , we can realize the significance of solving this crisis .
Innovation of new machines which consume less energy is a good way to solve the problem .
Since there is less energy , we should reduce consumption first .
We can save energy by improving new technology .
Engineers can design new kinds of machines and find new material which can be used to manufacture instruments so that less energy can be consumed .
In addition , finding some new energy is also a feasible solution to prevent the crisis .
There will be a day when we use up all the resources .
So for solving this problem , we should also look for new kinds of energy , such as bio energy , i .e .
eco energy , solar energy and so on .
Take the bio energy as an example .
The bio-energy is that energy obtained from bio-fuel (eco-fuel) .
Today , the well known bio-fuel (the biological one) are ethanol and biodiesel .
They are obtained from plants and used mostly in transportation .
(Emilian M . Dobrescu and Ciolacu C . B .C .
,2009) Since the fuel generates from plants , it means that new energy is renewable .
It can be produced and never limited .
We can implement sustainable development regardless of shortage of resources .
So engineers should do more research on new energy and take more fearless experiments to see if there are some plants can be used to produce energy .
In fact , the new energy is the key to prevent the crisis .
Human has faced a very serious problem , the crisis of shortage of energy .
Because the speed of industrial development increases so fast , more energy is needed .
This leads to the shortage of fuel or resources .
So what engineers should do is to invent new machines which can consume less energy and find new sorts of resources to replace the old non renewable one .
The crisis will almost be solved if we take these two solutions into action .
Furthermore , Engineers should take responsibility to make contribution to the solution , to produce products which can make human live better .
In recent years , Singapore has placed more and more emphasis on research and development , establishing her status of being home to innovations .
Annually , millions of funds are being pumped into the R&D sector to encourage innovations to offer solutions to the pressing challenges Singapore faces .
Indeed , great success has been achieved , for instance Singapore's clean water technology is widely recognized by the world .
The large scale research and development effort has placed Singapore as the leader in new water technologies especially in membrane applications .
Despite her huge success in many areas , Singapore does face problems which hamper engineering design processes for innovations .
One problem faced by engineering design in Singapore is the various restrictions due to socio-political system of the country .
Innovations are restricted by the many rules and regulations the country imposed , and sometimes the over emphasis of specific policies which causes development of ideas in an irrelevant area to be neglected .
Singapore is renowned for her strict implementation of rules , and in times it may be seen as too inflexible .
As such , innovations in the contentious areas are often restricted .
The ideas eventually accepted are shaped primarily by commercial interests and governmental policies .
In recent years , the core objectives of the country's research and development project have been directed in the area of clean energy and water technology .
Various programmes have been initiated to establish Singapore as the Global Clean Energy Hub , for instance the Clean Energy Research Programme , which is a competitive funding scheme to encourage innovations in this area .
However , the over exertion of her efforts may simply cause innovations in the other areas to be neglected .
As a result , innovation process is interrupted at the stage of research and development with the absence of supports and attention .
Aside from this , innovations that are radically different face even greater problems in being accepted .
This can be attributed to the inflexibility of the system causing rejection of innovations that is less relevant with the corporate or country's interest .
Another problem faced by engineers in Singapore is the limitations in resources .
Despite having the most advance infrastructure , the best institute for research , Singapore still lacks the resources for certain development .
Due to her limitations , innovations in some areas are restricted since the accessibility to resources would be too difficult and pose potential problems .
High cost may be incurred for certain research when scarce resource or externally imported resources involved .
Foreign experts may also be engaged to facilitate researches .
Hence the lack of resources adds hindrance to the process of innovation .
Aside from the lack of resources for the research and development stage , difficulties may be faced in finding suitable target group for the innovation result within the country .
The low population of the country disables experimentation on a large scale basic which eventually may cause inaccuracy in the result .
Indeed just earlier this year , a team of National University of Singapore researchers find themselves facing this problem .
The team came up with a chair that turns sound into vibrations , which can potentially help the deaf to experience sound better .
However , a problem was faced when they attempt to test out the chair .
They could not get access to enough deaf children locally for the test thus had to travel to Sri Lanka for the test out .
In the engineering of the eco-car , it is also evident that the lack of resources poses great deal of challenges to the team of NUS students , having to import the materials outside of Singapore .
Hence the process of engineering design is hampered by the lack of resource not only at stages of research and development , but also in the diffusion of the innovation .
In conclusion , despite Singapore's efforts in establishing herself as the Home for Innovations , engineer are compelled by several restrictions such as lack of resources and the inflexibility of the social system .
However , it does not mean engineering design in Singapore is not favorable .
In fact , great success has been achieved in some areas where it face less restrictions .
In the 21st century , everything develops in a very fast pace .
The needs of human beings increase .
In order to meet the people's needs , the engineers or scientists start to do research and design something for the people's sake .
They keep on trying and repeating the experiments , and eventually succeed to generate a new technology .
The serendipitous discovery of new ideas therefore , sometimes comes out during the trials .
No matter the technology was resulted from a long period of research or a serendipitous discovery , this technology must have been done by a group or an individual who has already acquired certain knowledge .
They are believed to have undergone many researches and discussions .
According to Rogers (2003) , six main stages are involved in the way to come out the technology , they are recognizing a problem , research , development , commercialization , diffusion and adoption and consequences .
This is not an easy works but requires times and efforts to deal with it .
Moreover , although the serendipitous idea is not the desirable outcome , it benefits the world .
The notable example that I want to discuss here is penicillin .
It was accidentally discovered by Alexander Fleming during his investigation about the properties of staphylococci .
This antibiotic is the first drug that is effective against the syphilis and staphylococcus infections .
It successfully saved the people who suffered from the diseases and gave them happiness to have the chance to live again .
In brief , the two products , laptop and penicillin , are either generated through a long period of research or a serendipitous discovery , they are both made out to meet the people's requirements .
Although they may not be the best outcome to fulfil the people's needs , they still lead the world to a technological innovation .
Topic: How electrical dictionary is shaped by students' need and the specific factors that have shaped its innovation .
I have been witnessed the development of electronic dictronary .
From the huge one with the simplest function to today's lovely and multi-functional one , electronic dictronary have been refined again and again .
By saying electronic dictronary , I refer to the small handheld computer which people commonly use to look up words .
The development of electronic dictronary is deeply shaped by the need of students , who are the majority of their customers .
In the latter paragraphs , i will talk about how students' need determine the development of electronic dictronary .
The most obevious change is that the function of electronic dictronary has greatly improved due to the change in students demand .
At the very beginning , it can do nothing but look up words .
In comparision , nowadays electronic dictronary are much more multi-functional .
For example , it can not only look up words in Chinese and English as the old one does , but also many other languages , like Japanese and Franch as well .
It is intellectualized , which enables the users to enrich their electronic dictronary as they like .
And what they need to do is simply downloading programms and install them in the electronic dictronary .
Moreover , as students are not content with a boring study tool , electronic dictronary today can act as good company during leisure time because it possesses the function of MP3/MP4 player and even PSP !
Another significant improvement is the appearance of electronic dictronary .
Instead of the hand-size one , it is only lemon-size big now with a much lighter weight .
As a direct result , it is convience to carry and win students' regards .
As English is a complusary course to learn in China , electronic dictronary has almost become a necessity to students .
And nearly everyone has one .
Thus it is not simply a tool , but a personal belonging to reprsent their appitite and modernise .
The electronic dictronary with an outstanding look allows students to show off around their fellows .
So the surface becomes bright-colored and beautifully decorated .
All these changes are aimed to cater for students taste and finally attract their attention .
Last but not least , the price of electronic dictronary is also influenced by students .
As students do not have job , they have to ask their parents for money .
Hence they can not spend too much on an electronic dictronary .
In addition , the limitation of electronic dictronary , such as no access to the the Internet , also determines that the price of electronic dictronary can not be too high .
It can not be as expensive as a computer .
In conclusion , electronic dictronary plays an importance role in students' study , and students in return shape and decide the development of electronic dictronary in many aspects , like price , appearance and function .
It can be seen that as technology develops , electronic dictronary will be more and more helpful to students .
Before a technology innovation is developed and patented , scientists have to go through a tedious research process most of the time .
However , there are also occasional chances that R&D workers fortuitously discover an invention when they were actually pursuing something else .
Whichever way an invention is created , it helps satisfy human needs and solve existing problems .
However , there are still differences between a technology developed with via research such as the electric car and one serendipitously discovered like penicillin .
All technological innovations , regardless of their developing process , help solve world problems .
In view of the increasing emphasis of eco friendliness , the US General Motor R&D unit developed the electric car IMPACT during the early 1990s .
This development received great responses from people throughout the US as it signifies one big step towards solving existing environmental problems such as the global warming .
Similarly , Alexander Fleming's discovery of Penicillin made many deadly diseases such as Tuberculosis curable .
This groundbreaking discovery also won Fleming a Nobel Prize .
Therefore , the common factor of all technological developments is that they address existing social problems , in one way or another .
However , there are still differences between an innovation that is developed via continuous research and one that is serendipitously discovered .
These discrepancies can be further categorized in terms of their purpose , procedure and effect .
The conventional innovation process requires the engineers to first identify a human need before the research officially begin .
This ensures that the research has a proper target .
Take the development of electric cars as an example , engineers recognized the increasing emphasis on eco friendliness , and therefore developed the vehicle without fuel powered engine to ease global warming .
On the other hand , a serendipitously discovered product is not the preset goal that the researchers want to achieve .
Its application is realized after the product has already been created .
Alexander Fleming did not expect to discover penicillin mould when he left the petri dish containing Staphylococcus plate culture open .
Therefore , an innovation involving continuous research and development differs from an accidental discovery as the former is a rational problem solving process while the latter is more of a lucky surprise .
Apart from the difference in purpose , the conventional innovation products and the one serendipitously discovered also undergo different research and development procedures .
The conventional products usually go through careful planning stages , making the whole development process well prepared .
These innovations are usually backed by solid technological background , expertise and sufficient funds .
GM allocated $2 billion for designing , manufacturing and marketing of their electric car IMPACT , after which expert diffusion scholars helped in campaigning for the product throughout the United States .
Within one year , the first tier of cars was put into mass production .
On the contrary , when Fleming discovered penicillin mould , he then had to refer his discovery to Charles Thom , an American specialist for further research .
It took more than 10 years for penicillin to be eventually purified and applied to medical use .
Lastly , the immediate effectiveness of a conventional innovation may be more conspicuous than that of a fortuitous discovery .
The centralized research procedure gives engineers more careful thoughts in the development of a conventional innovation .
The technological product created is thus more sophiscated and addresses human need more directly .
On the other hand , accidental discovery may be too crude for actual application immediately .
After Fleming had discovered penicillin , a series of specialists , including himself , had to carry out tedious research trials to further improve penicillin to ensure stable reaction on human bodies .
In conclusion , technological products developed via research do differ from those serendipitous discoveries in terms of their purposes , research procedures and immediate effects .
Despite of this fact , these products all serve to solve existing problems .
Yet technological innovation is not like a lottery game .
Instead , it should be a conscientious and exact pursuit of solutions .
Although there are occasional lucky winners , engineers should still put in every endeavour in all research processes .
Technological innovations shaped the modern lifestyle .
We use electricity , watch television , surfing around the billions of website every day .
Some of those inventions have become an essential part of our life and we cannot live without these inventions .
However , it is clear that these inventions are not produced overnight and human beings had put in a lot of time and efforts to develop and generate them .
Generally , innovations can be generated in two ways -- conventional research or skunkwork .
There are some differences and similarities between the technologies created in the two different backgrounds .
One of the main differences between conventionally generated technology and skunkwork product is the speed of generating the product .
According to Rogers (2003) , skunkwork refers to a small group of highly selected people designated to do research for an innovation without carry out tedious organization procedures .
While conventional research requires the researchers to do large amount of reports , discussions and management procedures , skunkwork provides pathway to develop an invention quickly without being constrained by bureaucratic processes .
Therefore , innovations that were created in a skunkwork environment are usually created faster than those inventions created by conventional research .
For example , Roger (2003) states that the skunkwork of producing laptop , lead by Mizoguchi , involves 10 engineers from military projects and takes only 24 months to complete .
In contrast , a conventionally generated technology may not have move that fast .
Conventional research involves a lot of management procedures .
The research must be approved by the corporate leaders before it can be carried out .
Therefore , conventionally generated technology usually moves slower than that of the skunkwork production .
To sum up , conventionally generated technology and skunkwork invention bear some differences and shares some common points .
Although they differs in the procedure throughout the development of a technology , the 2 ways are heading towards a common goalto produce a better environment for human beings .
Engineering design process is a suitable method that allows engineers to analyze the problems and developing solutions to it .
It breaks down those critical sections and allows the project to proceed in an orderly manner with proper guidelines .
The following is an example of using engineering design process as an approach to solve the problem .
The topic that is catching most attention nowadays would be on global warming or climatic change .
Many engineers and scientists are brainstorming for new ideas to prevent global warming from worsening .
According to National Geographic (August , 2009) , the 'Big Idea' is to launch millions of reflective particles or tiny 'sun shades' into space (between the Earth and the Sun) .
These ideas may sound ludicrous , however it is the easiest method that enables us to store more time while we change our lifestyle and prepares for global warming .
Launching a few huge sunshades at the altitude , especially at the poles and oceans , this allows some of the heat to be reflected away from them , thus reducing the temperature and melting of glaciers .
Our oceans absorb tremendous quantities of heat that was emitted by the Sun due to the high heat capacity of water .
A relationship is established between the rising sea level and the rise in temperature (or carbon dioxide concentration) , the graph below is taken from a scientific journal 'Climatic Dynamics' which shows us the relationship .
[pic]
Launching of sunshades has two advantages , firstly to store enough time to change our lifestyle permanently , example reduce in poultry consumption , reducing the usage of non-environmental friendly materials .
Secondly , to develop more advance technologies such as clean fuel and energy conserving systems .
However , this is not a permanent solution to solve the problem , it is a mitigation step that slows down the crisis from occurring .
It is necessary for us to remove those "sunshades" when Earth starts to cool down , glaciers reform and most importantly , when we (humans) are ready .
Ergonomics , Product Safety and Liability and Mechanical/Strength Analysis
Locating the sunshades at remote areas , reduce the probability of injuries in case of any accident .
The material use for the sunshades will mainly be some reflective materials , example sulfate .
It is important that the sunshades are able to stay within the designated area when the Earth orbits around the Sun .
Sunshades switch over would be carry out periodically , as maintenance work could be quite tedious as changing of parts will requires the sun shades to ascend down .
High durability , battery life and able to function at low temperatures must be considered during the design phase .
Economic and Market Analysis
This method allows us to combat global warming easily and fastest compared to many other solutions .
Ken Caldeira , a climate expert at the Carnegie Institution said , "If a country starts thinking it's in their vital interests to do this , and they have the power , I find it hard to imagine them not doing it ."
Identify and Establish the Need , Develop a Problem Statement
In brief , geoengineering solution allows us to fight global warming temporary , it is just a mitigation approach and not a preventive one .
It is still dependent on us to start changing our lifestyle and cut down on carbon emissions , just in case the sunshades fail , the crisis that we have been masking would soon rush towards us at once .
There are many different views and stands about global warming , discussions are still carrying out between the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and delegates from oil and gas industry .
Regardless of the conclusion , at the end of the day , we are still required to prepare for the worst situation .
How can planet Earth and the entire human species escape from this impending crisis ?
Many people have been trying tremendously hard in reducing the carbon emission by using clean energy or going into a vegetarian diet .
These methods do work , but only minority of the population is doing it , and results could only be seen after many years of efforts .
Establish Criteria for Success
Earth is heated up by the Sun's energy and many believe that the increasing amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere worsen global warming by retaining more heat .
Instead of reducing the carbon emission , we can solve this impending crisis by finding some methods that reduces the heat source or able to manipulate the heat input onto Earth .
2 .
Gather pertinent information
Search for Information Resources
Research has shown that whenever a volcano erupts , it releases large amount of dust and gaseous chemicals causing a thick layer of haze to form around the planet , thus reducing the average temperature of Earth by almost one degree Fahrenheit .
3 .
Generate multiple solutions
Engineering designing plays a key role in technological innovation .
According to Seyyed Khandani (2005) , engineering design includes creating technological products which have never existed before and improving the existing devices or systems .
There are five basic steps for solving a design problem: define the problem , gather pertinent information , generate multiple solutions , analyze and select a solution , and test and implement the solution .
Although the description of the designing process is simple and clear , the implement of engineering design is rather complicated and requires several crucial qualities .
Two of the most important qualities are creative thinking skills and intensive working habbit .
However , two problems in China deprived them of these two qualities .
First of all , Chinese education system largely destroyed students' creative thinking skills .
Inovative thinking contains natural curiosity and bold imagination whereas analytical thinking is comprised of experiences .
The schools in China usually aim at cultivating students' analytical skills by teaching them knowledge and testing them on the knowledge been taught .
But the education system doesn't encourage students to think out of the box to give their own answers or to explore the mysterious world .
This "education for examination" strategy have two negative impact on engineering design .
First , it prevents students from detecting real problems by themselves which is essential in the first step of engineering design .
As the experiences filling up students' minds , their curiosity is fading day by day until they don't even bother to take notice the world surrounding them .
In addition , it limits the possible solutions students could come up with , therefore hampers the third step .
Examination often denies imagination .
Hence students gradually lose the ability to conceive fresh ideas .
However , the best way to solve a problem may not be taught by lecturers and books .
Sometimes , we need to use our own brain to find it out .
Secondly , Chinese society destracted engineers from devoting into innovative work .
In scientific world , most of the greatest contributers are from western countires; the only two Chinese scientist who won Nobel Prize developed their theories in America .
Similarly , in technological area , Chinese engineers seldom have breakthroughs .
These phenomena can be largely subscribed to the impulsive atmosphere of Chinese society .
As a result of the impulsive atmosphere , Chinese government focused too much on economic development but input too little on technological research .
Compared with the developed countries , China stressed more on implement rather than generation of engineering design .
Besides the indifference from government , engineers also didn't attach much importance to engineering design .
Engineering design is a meaningful work but requires lots of sacrifice and devotion since it couldn't generate benefits promplty and directly .
Hence , this impulsive atmosphere seriously impacts the whole engineering design .
The lack of innovative thinking skills and the indifference to the creative work have already hampered Chinese engineering design .
To promote creative-centered research and design , China have to transform greatly in these two dimensions .
In Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs , health clinches the second platform of the pyramid under the classification of safety needs .
Health , good health in particular , is an important part of our lives .
The Prime Minister in his National Day Rally speech gave immense significance to healthcare .
With health being the subject of conversation in most places , it would not be wrong to classify good health as a need in today's world .
The measures taken to improve the healthcare system worldwide ranges from the fundamental implementation of affordable healthcare in poor countries to the more advanced introduction of stem cell research .
With one notion of improving the healthcare system , man has even delved into surgery assisted by robots .
Some might find this assisted surgery difficult to fathom while others might argue about the competency of such a system .
Amidst all these opposition , the Da Vinci surgical system rose prominently from the California company intuitive surgical .
This Da Vinci surgical system would not have been made possible without the engineering design process as described by Khandani .
The engineering design process gears up with , first , defining and understanding a problem , The brainchild of the Da Vinci surgical system was the primary need to make the surgical process a less invasive one .
To put it in better words , it was to reduce the size of incisions and to forego the need to crack bones or rib cages .
The problem in this case is the intrusiveness of the surgical procedure on the human body .
With the problem reinstated , it then becomes crucial to mark down the requirements towards accomplishing the design .
However , as mentioned by Khandani , following the development of the design solution , these requirements will have to reviewed later .
Initially , the requirements for this design to kick start were its effectiveness in performing surgery , its ability to be user-friendly and the capacity of it to work without posing potential danger to the patient .
Overall , with the base of the design process carefully established , it would be easier to get to the imminent task .
Following the defining of the problem was the task of gathering sufficient information .
Lack of information would turn out to be potentially lethal to any design process and the Da Vinci surgical system was no exception to this .
The spectrum of information was spread out in all ways , from the need to understand possible fallbacks in the design process to previous attempts at creating the surgical system .
Khandani in his viewpoint mentioned various sources of information like the internet and library .
Information , being a liabilty , will first have to be sourced out and then scrutinized to the minute details .
With information as a good layback , the design can grace the next stage which is the formulation of many solutions to the problem .
With concised understanding of the problem and important information , the design will move to the next stage of creating solutions .
A single solution alone will not be able to suffice in making the design a roaring success .
A good engineer will have to contemplate on various solutions and from various angles .
After gathering various solutions to the problem at hand , Khandhani suggested narrowing down to one solution after considering the pros and cons of each solution .
Making surgery less invasive could mean inventing other instruments but the reason a robot was chosen signifies the importance of surgery .
The lives of patients cannot be placed in jeopardy and inventing a design that comprises on safety of the patient was an absolute no .
In the case of the Da Vinci surgical system , it will not be able to function unless it detects the presence of the surgeon's head in the viewer .
This was indication that the surgery was still in safe hands and was the best solution to making surgery less invasive .
Therefore the solution was specified and the design process was nearing completion .
Having a solution to the problem did not indicate a successful design process until the design was tested and implemented .
This stage depicts the take off of the design for the first time after many trial attempts and failures .
Khandani in his article mentioned four sub categories in the take off which are namely prototyping , concurrent engineering , documentation and applying for patents .
A good engineer will have to consider these sub categories before his creation takes place .
In context to the Da Vinci surgical system , take off of the system also meant clearance by the FDA .
The FDA's approval formed another sub category other than those mentioned by Khadhani in his article .
July 2000 was a significant date in the history of the Da Vinci surgical system and was a mark that the world was taking the first step towards digital surgery .
July 2000 was the date the surgical system could perform advanced surgical techniques .
The opportunity to test and implement meant that the surgical system was ready to start its race in addressing health concerns .
In conclusion , the need of the world and the attempts to address the need required one to go through an engineering design process .
Health was the need in this case and the Da Vinci surgical system went through the design process .
It is worthwhile to note how the healthcare system as a problem metamorphosized into the generation of solution in the name of the Da Vinci surgical system .
The engineering design process as Khandhani clearly paints in his article is the guiding tool for various important inventions .
Overall , the system is an effective design that has addressed the health concern of the world .
In ancient China , there were four great inventions , the gunpowder , printing , the compass and paper making .
However in modern times , the engineering design developed very slowly .
Why did this happen ?
I think there are many reasons .
In the Qing dynasty , the governing class implemented closed door policy , which made the society stagnated for a long time .
Then the Cultural Revolution made a deep effect on Chinese society which needed another long time for China to recovery .
Even nowadays there are still some problems existed which hamper the engineering design process .
Here we are going to talk about two problems , the examination-oriented education system and the worship of authorities .
The examination-oriented education , as the name implies , is the education whose purpose is getting high grades in the exam .
Teachers teach for the exam .
Students study for the exam .
This results that students have high scores but low abilities .
In the first stage of the engineering design process--define the problem , people need an active mind to design problem , but many students under the examination-oriented education system only know how to use their knowledge to answer the question on the examination paper , they do not know how to use knowledge to solve the real problems .
In the third step of the design processgenerate multiple solutions , this needs divergent thinking and analytical skills , whereas the examinationoriented education do not emphasis the importance of thinking and skills .
Its only purpose is high score in the exam .
The skills which needed in the design process cannot be gain from such an education system .
Chinese educationalists have noticed this problem .
They have implemented another education system , education for allrounded development , which emphasis that developing students' abilities is the most important thing .
These problems hampered the process of engineering design for innovation .
When there are problems , there also must be some ways to solve the problems .
China has already find ways to solve these problems , but solving these problems needs time .
I believe that one day there is no problem in the way to innovation in China .
In view of the rising fuel prices in the recent decade , car manufacturers have addressed the need to reduce costs in production , so as to be able to pass on minimal costs to the consumers , yet still remain competitive and appealing in the market .
To invest , research and produce the electric car is a good deal in the long run , mainly because the car runs on electricity that is of a much lower cost than fuel .
Furthermore , this would reduce the dependency on fuel in the future for cars , should one day the world has run out of fuel .
With this in mind , the car manufacturer General Motors embarked on a $2 billion project on designing , manufacturing and marketing the electric vehicles in the early 1990s (Rogers , 2003) .
They had received an overwhelming response from the masses to test-drive the new car when they launched their test-drive campaign .
Mavens , who were specialists and consultants in their own field of expertise , were selected .
They provided opinions and disseminating the information of the electric car to the larger market , which eventually boosted the total car sales of GM when they officially launched their first electric car into the market in the late 1990s (Rogers , 2003) .
From the economic viewpoint , the technology of the electric car would benefit the manufacturers from the reductions of their production costs in the long run , and this would spur them on to increase their production with improved technology .
One of the more outstanding features of an electric car is its non-polluting factor .
With increased global warming and rapid emissions of greenhouse gases from factories and fuel-powered vehicles , there is an urgent need to reduce these emissions and the clean technology of the electric car is one of the solutions to address the environmental concerns .
To invest in the green technology would therefore require a significant amount of financial resources , and to encourage continuation in this area of research , the government plays a role as a banker to grant incentives to these companies .
In early August this year , US President Obama had announced that incentives of $2 .4 billion are to be pumped into the development of the eco-friendly technology (CNN .com , 2009) .
With the financial aid from the government and the promising potential sales of the electric cars in the market , the car manufacturers are much complied to design , improve and thus , market these cars while the heat is still on .
Even back in the 1990s , the government had already taken action to encourage the innovation of electric cars .
The California and Arizona state governments had announced and made compulsory for 10 per cent of the total car sales in the market to be environmentally-friendly , so as to reduce the pollution levels in their states (Rogers , 2003) .
Social construction of technology is also what called as the social determinist technology .
The electric car is clearly an example of such technology because as early as 1990s , the environmental issues were already present such that the government had to take action to mitigate the situation .
It was only due to economic reasons recently that the production of electric cars is stepped up .
Behind the scenes , the birth of the technology of the electric car is primarily due to the society reasons then , and even till today , the electric car is constantly being re-designed and improvised with better technology so as to remain competitive in the market and most importantly , eco-friendly on the roads .
There is a legend that has been fascinating people from some one thousand year ago: God was going to send a deluge to destroy the earth and almost all the living things on earth which had become corrupt .
However , taking pity on what he had created , he instructed Noah to build a big vessel to save some species of the creatures .
Ultimately , the great flood wiped out all the beings except those Noah have conserved on the ark .
This Bible version of saving the dying out creatures inspired scientists to work on a new "Noah Ark" , or a "doomsday" conservancy , to store genetic materials in case of future use for both scientific purpose and biological diversity .
However , this time , the one who destroys the earth is no more the god but human beings themselves .
As a matter of fact , the Earth's population is currently increasing , coupled with pollution , urban sprawl , deforestation , and climate warming which caused serious damages to the habitats of the plants and animals .
These series of human activities with their negative effects on the environment directly lead to an inevitable consequence: species extinction .
Dr . Donald A . Levin , Professor of Biology , University of Texas , Austin once claimed in the January-February issue of American Scientist magazine , "Although the extinction of various species is a natural phenomenon , the rate of extinction occurring in today's world is exceptional -- as many as 100 to1 ,000 times greater than normal ."
The alarm-bells have been rung , which draws worldwide attention .
Both scientists and environmentalists are endeavoring to change the situation , and fortunately there is good news for those who really care about the endangered creatures .
Besides the set up biological laboratories , various kinds of DNA repositories have been built while more plans are under way .
So far , there are already more than 1 ,400 seed banks in the world , in addition to those are intended for both plants and animal DNA storage .
A technical question may be raised from the public: how to store DNA ?
Newspapers revealed some information on this issue .
Genetic material Samples are placed inside tiny vials , which then were put into numbered boxes with special code respectively .
The temperatures of vats storing the species are normally adjusted to -160 to -18 degrees Celsius depending on different species .
In the vats there is liquid nitrogen , but samples are perched above 20 centimeters of it to let the vapor , instead of the liquid itself cool and preserve the genetic information .
As such , specimens can be perfectly stored for some 1000 years .
However , can the problem of species extinction really be solved by this technology ?
Since this particular technology came into being under the influence of human activities , it will definitely continue changing .
In other words , when the technology becomes more mature and more profitable in the future (which is very possible) , it is very hard to guarantee that it will only be put into good use .
What if the issue involves crime , disease or simply moral controversy like cloning ?
The outcome remains to be seen .
Anyway , social requirement created it and it is meeting the allowable needs for the time being .

Technologies have the capabilities of solving problems and improving on our daily life .
In order to come out with useful technologies , Rogers (2003) states that the process involves research for more in depth understanding of scientific knowledge , followed by research to solve specific problem and finally , development of the technologies .
However , in the mist of researching on a particular technology , discovery of new technologies may appear unexpectedly .
There are both similarities and differences between technologies developed via research and technologies resulted from a serendipitous discovery .
For example , the invention of laptops and the discovery of 3M Post-it pads respectively .
Laptops and Post-it pads are both favorable to us in one way or another .
In the case where space constraint is of concern , laptops will be the solution .
This is due to the fact that the size of laptops is much smaller than desktop computers as the latter consist of monitors as well as central processing units (CPU) .
According to Rogers (2003) , "the laptop made particular sense in Japan , due to crowded offices and small homes" .
Similarly , the 3M Post-it pads are useful to us in our daily life .
With Post-its , any notes , instructions or reminders can be written on it and attached to "a letter or other document" (Rogers , 2003) .
Hence , both inventions are beneficial to us .
The two technologies also possess another similarity , that is , they are both profitable .
According to Rogers (2003) , laptops demand increased from 5 ,000 units per month in 1986 to 100 ,000 in 1989 .
Nowadays , laptops are still widely used all over the world by students as well as businessmen .
This infers that laptops are doing well in the market .
Likewise , Post-it pads are "one of the 3M's most profitable products" (Rogers , 2003) .
Thus , both the laptops and the Post-it pads are profitable .
However , between these two technologies , one of their differences is how the idea came about .
For invention of laptops , idea came about when there was a problem to be solved , which is , "due to crowded offices and small homes" (Rogers , 2003) in Japan .
On the other hand , for the 3M Post-it pads , the unexpected discovery came about when 3M researchers are investigating on a new adhesive (Rogers , 2003) .
Therefore , the creation of Post-it pads is unintentional while creation of laptop is with intended purposes .
Another difference between the two technologies is regarding the room for further development .
For laptops , advancements are constantly introduced to attract the market .
For example , there are faster processors and more internal memory space being incorporated .
In addition to that , shrinking of laptops sizes and the variations of designs makes them even more attractive than before .
There will surely be more enhancements to come in the near future .
However , for Post-it pads , the developments are probably limited to colors , shapes , size and the extent of how sticky it is .
Hence , in terms of future developments , laptops may have a better prospect as compared to Post- it pads .
In conclusion , both technologies , which were either developed by research or by chance , have its similarities as well as differences .
Although there are certain differences between them , the characteristics that both are profitable and useful in our daily life operation in one way or the other are important elements when developing a technology .
Therefore , no matter whether the creation is based on research or luck , as long as it benefits us in one way or the other , it is a great invention .
According to Rogers (2003) , the development of technologies can be examined from a technologically determinist perspective , that is to create a revolution in the society .
However , for technologies to be widely adopted and successful , inputs from the society must never be neglected .
In fact , innovations are more often shaped by social aspects .
One example of such technology is the 3-D printer .
The 3-D printer currently available has the ability to produce complex model of differing shapes and sizes in a short duration .
In addition , it can print on various materials ranging from rubber to plastic .
These properties of the 3-D printer are consequences of psychological and economic factors .
Present technology is insufficient to convince investors to finance proposals , especially in the manufacturing or construction sector .
While computer-aided designing software is available to produce 3-D simulation , it lacks realism .
Since such project involves huge amount of money , investors must be ascertained that their commitment will bring them profit .
One way of convincing them is to produce physical prototypes where that can feel and scrutinize .
Secondly , creating models with traditional means is time consuming , which does not make economical sense to businesses .
Companies are often engaged in a race to unveil their product ahead of their competitors , so as to seize a major share of the marketplace .
In such situation , time is of essence .
In consideration of these factors , designers have conceived the 3-D printer , which is capable of speeding up designing process .
Based on a report in The Economist (2009) , it now takes Timberland merely ninety minutes to turn a design of a new sole into a model using the 3-D printer , a significant decrease from a week that the process requires in the past .
The factors that shaped the technological innovation of the 3-D printer discuss thus far are coming from the end-user perspective .
However , factors from the manufacture's viewpoint are also considered to ensure the commercial success of the 3-D printer .
These factors have also influenced the design of the 3-D printer .
The designing of the 3-D printer is also influenced by the potential profitability of it .
The development of the technical aspects of a technology involves the devotion of large amount of resources , which will results in increased cost .
As with all business operators , corporate manufacturers must ensure that their product is profitable , or at the basic able to recuperate the financial resources poured into research and development .
The designers of the 3-D printer had ensured that their product appeal to a large consumer group by boosting its functionality .
As mentioned in The Economist (2009) , the "machine can not only produce things out-of plastic , but also complex ones with moving parts ."
In conclusion , the technological innovation of the 3-D printer is shaped by the demand for realistic model that can be produced in a short time .
Besides , it is also influenced by the potential profitability of the corporate manufacturer .
The engineering design processes as described by Khandani(2005) provides a well-rounded methodology to come up with solutions to a need .
The process starts with identifying the underlying cause of the need to effectively solve the problem at hand , followed by research on the topic for better understanding .
Brainstorming for solutions comes next and the engineer lists out all the possible solutions for self-critique later .
Armed with more information on the problem , the engineer would be able to make better decisions on the final solution to optimise on and adaptation as a prototype .
The focus of this essay is; however , on the ways the engineering design processes help fulfil a particular need .
Therefore the final step of implementing the solution will not be discussed .
In 1997 , a group of countries agreed to commit to the Kyoto Protocol , which aims towards a reduction of greenhouse gases emitted in view of the potential climatic changes to come should the situation be left unattended to .
Today , even as many other countries have taken small steps towards the control of greenhouse emissions , the fact remains that a large portion of the energy we generate for human consumption still comes from the burning of fossil fuels .
There is therefore a need for a more environmentally friendly way to generate the energy for our use .
The development of a problem statement gives the engineer a chance to look into the elements which the need is comprised of .
In this case , to reduce the undesirable emissions of mainly carbon dioxide , sulphur dioxide and the oxides of nitrogen in order to provide environmentally friendlier energy .
With the aid of a clear problem statement , the engineer is able to tackle the problem at its core by following through with an objective-specific statement .
In the last step of our discussion , the analysis and therefore selection of a single solution for adaptation , falls back heavily upon previous research .
The engineer must be mindful of various factors and make a choice towards one solution which balances the criterion he deems necessary for his product to meet the need .
I defined the more important requirements of the final solution to be its ease of acceptance by users , the extent of reduction of undesirable emissions and the time taken for implementation and effect .
Comparing the two solutions , alternate sources of energy like wind energy , hydroelectric energy or nuclear energy significantly reduces the amount of greenhouse gas produced .
However , it is not likely that they will be able to replace the current infrastructures of fossil fuel generators at a quick rate due to high start-up costs , and in some cases geographical constraints .
Hence , despite being an ideal solution in the long run , alternate energy sources are unable to curb the problem now .
On the other hand , increasing efficiency of current generators allow for optimisation tune-ups , which are less costly and more likely to be welcomed and readily adopted by the energy business .
Furthermore , there is much room for improvements in fuel to energy efficiency; with innovation towards developing upgrades for conventional generators to better utilise the usual energy lost as heat , the amount of fuel needed and therefore greenhouse gas emissions could see a decrease of upwards of 20 percent .
The solution to the need of an environmentally friendlier way to generate energy based on my particular set of factors is therefore to innovate for an add-on to existing power generators to provide greater efficiency of fuel to energy conversion .
This will reduce the greenhouse emissions as smaller amounts of fuel would be needed to generate the same amount of energy , thus meeting our need .
The ubiquitous gasoline cars we have around the world nowadays are being slowly replaced by the electric-powered cars .
In fact , U .S President Barack Obama is aiming to put a million electric vehicles on the roads by 2015 (Peter , 2009) and with the world's number one superpower taking the lead , it is almost as sure that the rest of the world will jump on the bandwagon .
These battery-powered cars were previously a costly mode of transport limited to a niche market but they have since been reborn and are creating a new wave in the automobile market .
The rebirth of the electric vehicle technology can be attributed to the revived interest by the automobile giants , government regulations on greenhouse gas emission and also the improvement in the technicalities previously assosciated with electric cars .
This year , the US Department of Energy , after a highly competitive application process , handed out US$400 million in grants to the 'Big Three' - Chrysler , Ford and General Motors to develop next-generation technologies for electric vehicles (Elie , 2009) .
The vote of trust as shown by the Big Three's initiative in developing this technology has provided a huge boost to the viability of electric cars replacing gasoline vehicles as the main mode of transport on the roads .
Together with the strong backing of the government , it is exactly the type of stimulus that the electric vehicles require in order to make a strong and sustained headway into the automobile industry .
The global push towards the adoption of the electric vehicle technology is increasing in tempo .
However , for it to replace the gasoline vehicles will be an uphill task that requires a concerted effort from both the industry and governments .
Hybrid vehicles available on the roads nowadays are a good start , and hopefully in years to come , gasoline cars will be a thing of the past .
In Singapore , moving on to the commercialization stage of the design process is not easily achieved without going through tough brain storming .
There are many factors to consider in order for decisions to be made .
Thus , problems (may) arise and hinder the commercialization stage of the design process .
First of all , for the NUS eco-car innovation process , it is true that the development of eco-car is indeed environmental friendly .
It does save the Earth with its advanced technology of bringing upon "green" effects , which will be welcomed by everyone .
However , if eco-car is to proceed on with the commercialization stage in the engineering design process , the problem encountered by my home country is the capital cost .
This is because most of the parts contributed to the assembly of the eco car are bought from overseas and these better grade materials can be rare source and hard to acquire .
Furthermore , hiring skilled workers and buying machine to assemble car are costly as well .
Hence , for the eco-car to be launched in Singapore in its commercialization stage of the design process , the production of car will result in significantly increased in cost of retail price due to the high prices of raw materials in constructing of car .
The high retail price of car will significantly affect the decision of committee to commercialize the product as consumer would not pay much for it .
On the other hand , for the NUS Haptic Chair innovation process , the researchers had successfully developed the chair for the convenience of the deaf people in Singapore .
The problem that hampers the design process is the shortage of testers to test on the product , for which according to the article3 that there were not enough deaf children in Singapore to test this product .
Therefore , there will be no guarantee to the effectiveness to see how the product can be utilized and researcher will not be able to do modification and optimization to the chair for better performance .
Research is no doubt one of the key factors that contribute to the success of an innovation .
In Singapore , the research sector is one of the best funded field , besides education and defense .
With a population of only about 4 million , coupled with lack of natural resources , Singapore has no choice but to make the most of what resources are available .
Hence the significance and importance of research in Singapore .
Examples of common problems in the research sector are lack of skilled labour , time constraint and budget .
Take the NUS eco-car project for example which was engineered by NUS and still in the research stage .
It is not fully developed and commercialized yet because of its low market value .
To build an effective eco-car , a pool of skilled labour is needed .
However , in NUS , the project is of student level only .
With additional guidance from experienced engineers , the eco- car could have been better designed at probably have a better chance to be marketed .
The lack of skilled labour in the project caused it to be somewhat stuck at the research stage of the innovation process .
Hence the development of the eco-car was not consumer friendly and it was unable to move on to the commercialization stage .
Maybe it would be take a few more years before the eco-car have a potential to be marketed .
For this NUS FSAE race car , the innovation stops at the development stage as this is a NUS student project .
It will not be taken to the market level .
The success of the design will be based on the yearly race competition held on an international level .
To sum up , lack of skilled labour and inability to re-create computer simulation in real life are not the only 2 problems commonly faced in engineering design process in Singapore .
However , these 2 problems are enough to cause the downfall and failure of the product when placed in the market .
Engineering design processes consists of five different stages starting with defining the problem , followed by gathering pertinent information , generating multiple solutions , analyzing and selecting a solution and finally testing and implementing the solutions .
When solving a design problem , one may encounter problems that will hamper the design process .
In engineering design processes , two of the problems that will hamper the design process would be the lack of funds and resources .
Fund is an important factor that determines whether the design process can be carry on or otherwise .
To begin with the design process , there is a need to have a team of experts and researchers to sphere head the project which requires hiring cost .
Therefore , the lack of fund will result in the inability to hire professionals to accomplish the task .
Fund also plays an important role in purchasing materials to manufacture the product .
Most of the time , products are made over and over again to improve its weaknesses and strengthen its strengths .
Therefore , purchasing of materials can be quite costly as plenty of them will go to waste .
As a result , the lack of fund will hamper the progress of the design process as there is no material to manufacture a physical product to test its usefulness .
The design process does not stop after coming out with a final product .
This is because the product may not be perfect , and minor yet important changes need to be done to improve the product .
Therefore , further research needs to be done and money will be involved .
Without sufficient funds , research to further improve the product cannot be done and this may hamper the design process .
Another main problem that will hamper the engineering design process will be the lack of resources in terms of knowledge , raw material and technology .
Knowledge is very important in engineering design processes .
Without knowledge , one will not be able to make wise decisions during the design process .
For example in the aero plane design process , one needs to determine the material to be use as the body of the aircraft .
Without the knowledge of the characteristics of different materials , one will not be able to choose the best material , which must be strong yet light in weight , to be use .
Knowledge from past experiences will also help in ensuring a smoother design process .
In NUS , a team of students from the engineering faculty took part in Formula SAE Race Car Project in 2001 .
That was the first time engineering students from NUS took part in it .
Due to the fact that it was their first attempt , they realized that the lack of race car knowledge had hampered their design process , which they did not do well for the competition .
However , the engineering faculty has built up the race car knowledge after taking part in several annual competitions , and in the recent competition it came in 19th place .
Therefore , knowledge plays a crucial role in the design process and the lack of it will hamper the design process .
In summary , the flow of the design process can be hampered by the lack of funds and knowledge .
In the case of lacking of funds , companies need to find sponsorships to fund the cost of their design process .
However , knowledge is something that cannot be achieve overnight .
Having past experiences and studies will be the key to gain greater knowledge .
As a living being , maintaining a welfare life is of vital importance .
In fact , whether one can keep leading a high quality life largely depends on a reliable energy supply .
To illustrate it simply , one current need of modern people is the demand for a consistent energy source .
Therefore , engineering design process aims to invent a technology approach to meet people's need .
By identifying the problem and listing all the possible resolutions , it will figure out the best energy source and try to utilize it to supply energy .
After that , gradual improvements will make it more practical , which subsequently serve the public better .
It is known that we all live in a new era where every social activity or industry production activity we do is closely relevant to energy utilization .
Sometimes when the electricity power is cut off temporarily , or the price of petrol is raised rapidly , we will find that our lives are severely affected .
Hence , demand for effective energy supply is the major need of modern people .
The following step is to consider all possible new energy supply source and selecting the best one .
According to reliable research , the new energy supplies include nuclear energy , solar energy , and geothermal energy (Wikipedia) .
Their advantage mainly embodies in respect that they are all renewable energy source .
Among them , solar energy is the best choice because it is safer than nuclear energy and easier to be obtained than geothermal energy .
Hence , solar energy comes into our sights as an ideal energy source .
After that , engineering design process applies the engineering theorem and latest technology to practice , which amounts to effectively use solar energy .
For example , solar energy can be used to heat the bath water .
The whole process is like installing a solar penal containing many tubes on the roof of the house where the penal can be maximally exposes to the sunlight .
Then let the bath water flows through the tubes and absorbs the heat collected by the tubes .
Through heat transfer from tube to the water , bath water is heated .
Another application of solar energy is relevant to the energy generation .
Wind and falling water are actually different forms of solar energy (Harnessing direct solar energy a progress report , 2006) .
By releasing the energy stored in them , large amount of electricity is generated which can solve the electricity shortage in some regions of the world and give great support to the normal living and production activities .
Last but not least , the engineering design process still needs gradual improvements to truly meet people's need .
The production cost of solar energy is higher than that of fossil fuel energy , which therefore impedes its popularization .
Hence , how to cut the cost is what engineering designer should consider about in the future , in order to let solar energy be utilized more successfully .
Nowadays , people have been more health conscious than before .
The need can be seen when they are willing to spend hundreds to thousands of dollars on medical bills .
Challenges have been faced by doctors , drug researches and biomedical engineers to collaborate in this matter in order to come out with the best solution to address current health problems .
Example of it is the latest medical device called the IVDD machine (Intervetebral Disc Decompression Therapy) .
It is a device that addresses the problem of lower back pain .
This idea is discover when researchers realize that space travelers were relieved of low back pain and their disc height were actually increased .
This valuable information were used by engineers to develop IVDD to reproduce the same effects on earth .
A design idea can spark out elsewhere .
Other challenge face by design engineers is the availability of technology .
Technology is often the limiting factor when it come to design a sophisticated medical device .
Example of this is the electrosurgical device .
Electrosurgical device was not invented until it was realized that very high frequency of current can actually burn a tissue when the contact point is relatively small .
This idea and discovery has led to the invention of the CUSA Excel System , a device that performs bloodless tissue cutting which is used now in every hospital in Singapore .
Design can also come from the need and request of people .
Social need often has to be addressed by engineers to fulfill the market requirements .
To show an example , in this advancing and fast changing society , many working adult especially women has found extremely difficult to achieve a balanced between their family and work .
Engineers have addressed this problem with an effective solution by designing the milk pump .
The milk pump allows milk storage and feeding without the present of the mother allowing them to go to work without worrying to breast feed their baby .
It is very interesting to see that how engineering ideas can come about .
There is hundred of ways that an idea can originate from .
A design can come out in order to improve the older design such as the MRI machine , to address psychological problem of patient such as the fear of going through surgical operation or to assist medical personnel such as doctors to deliver better health service .
Other challenges face by engineers including patenting their designs , devices testing , performance benchmarking , training of medical personnel , custom modification of devices , law's requirements , safety concerns , compatibility with other medical devices  ,durability and usability  .
The challenges face is never ending for an engineer in order to come out with a state-of-the-art medical devices currently and also in the future .
When you are enjoying ice-cream in a sweltering summer , have you ever thought about that you are enjoying the privilege for rich people roughly 100 years ago ?
For your information , refrigerator is a rather new invention , and it is not widely used among common household until 1930s (Bowden & Offer , 1994) .
Then how does refrigerator come into being ?
Some factors such as the demand of lead user , economic factors , and environmental concern actually play important roles in shaping refrigerator into its shape today .
In the first place , the lead user of refrigerator is the first and most important factor that drives the development of refrigerator .
Lead user can be defined as a group of people that have the greatest need towards a potential invention .
According to Hippel (cited by Rogers , 2003) , lead user plays an important role in most of the innovation-designing process , because they usually have the needs of innovations that are "well ahead of the general market" .
In the case of refrigerator , lead user can be regarded as the food businessmen in 20th century , mainly because most food would perish very fast under normal temperature .
In addition , long distance transportation of food also requires low temperature to preserve the food .
Since the lead user has such a great need on a product that could help them keep the food cool easily , refrigerator was first commercially introduced to long distance food transportation in 1900s (Bowden & Offer , 1994) .
Lead user therefore started the application of refrigerator on business .
Last but not least , the environmental concern also helps to shape the refrigerator during its innovation-development process .
For example , one of the reasons why refrigerator was not widely used by common household before 1930s is because the refrigerator at that time was using toxic-gas system , which would destroy the environment and be unsafe for home use .
What is more , the environmental concern has become more and more important in the development of refrigerator in the past decades .
One of the most popular refrigerants for refrigerator , Tetrafluoroethane , has been banned by the governments in a lot of countries , taking its depletion to the ozone layer into concern .
The environmental concern therefore leads the refrigerator develop in a more environmental-friendly direction .
In conclusion , in its innovation-development process , refrigerator is mainly shaped by the demand of food businessmen , as well as the economic factors and environmental concern .
Due to the number of words limited , this essay only scratches the surface of what leads to the invention and diffusion of the refrigerator , and picks out the three most obvious factors to discuss .
If you want to do more in-depth research on it , please go through the related journals and websites .
As the global economy continues its search for growth , its insatiable appetite for energy has greatly diminished our non-renewable resources .
Scientists have estimated that given the current global energy consumption , we only have sufficient oil reserves to last us for another 50 years .
Furthermore , greenhouse emissions produced from the burning of fossil fuels have lead to global warming , with its impact visible from the shrinkage of polar ice caps at the Arctic region as well as the rise in global temperature .
This could eventually cause flooding of low lying areas as well as food shortages and it paints a bleak picture for our future generation .
Therefore , the world is turning its head towards 'green' technology as a solution to the above crisis .
Research on the 'green' technology field has started way back in early 1950s , however it has only started to gain momentum recently as its economic and social benefits become more recognised .
With oil prices steadily climbing towards US$100 per barrel , business cost also rises with rising energy cost .
This would lead to price inflation and could cause an economic slowdown as affordability would be a concern .
Furthermore , if no other alternative energy sources are discovered , we could face severe economic problems when we eventually run out of oil , since we need energy to run our economy .
Investing in 'green' technology would not only ensure that we will have a steady supply of energy to develop our economy but it could also be another source of revenue for countries developing such technologies and some analysts has estimated that this industry could potentially be worth up to US$4 trillion .
Therefore , governments are pouring funds into research on this field to benefit from its economic advantages .
Next , there is a general consensus that global warming has been greatly attributed by the rise of greenhouse emission from the burning of fossil fuels , which could have devastating and irreversible impacts .
Recently , rising temperature has been causing frequent heat waves across Europe which has killed a number of people .
The rising temperature also gave rise to an increase in the number of heat stroke cases and could cause a potential health issue .
Furthermore , rising temperature also resulted in frequent droughts which caused food shortages and aggravate the world 'hunger' problem .
More significantly , the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers could endanger low lying areas and the rise in temperature could also cause severe imbalances in our delicate ecosystem .
This will impact all walks of life , including us , humans .
The world environmental system is now balanced on a crucial tipping point beyond which costly , devastating and irreversible impacts will be inevitable .
Therefore , the future of our planet lies in our hands and we must be socially responsible for our future generation .
Thus , environmental groups have been pressuring businesses and governments for 'green' energy solutions as we thread our economic progress with sustainability .
On top of that , governments have also been pushing for the 'green' agenda .
This is evident from the carbon tax law that has been imposed by European Union on businesses , which tax businesses on the amount of carbon they produced .
Furthermore , government are also awarding incentives for companies to go 'green' and more research funds have been allocated to this new field to develop 'green' products .
This is evident from President Obama's economic plan , which includes a US$ 1 trillion package invested into the 'green' industry so that 'greener' products can be developed to ensure economic sustainability .
'Green' technology maybe the main focus in this century , however it must be noted that investing in this technology is costly and not many businesses are willing to venture into it on its own .
Therefore , scientists , businessmen and governments must work together to find a feasible solution in balancing economic growth with sustainability .
In the age of information technology and globalization , the world we live today have progressed beyond our imagination by the aid of constant improvement in technology by research and development (R&D) as well as innovation .
In one of the Rogers's article in 'Diffusion of Innovations' (2003) , he has mentioned about the introduction of battery technology in the electric vehicle by General Motors (GM) in the early 1990s .
Interestedly , this significant technology was initially determined by the California and Arizona state governments inadvertently so as to tackle the issue of smog levels in Los Angeles and Phoenix at that period of time .
(Rogers , 2003) 'IMPACT' , which was renamed as EV , was the pioneer name of the electric car produced by GM (Rogers , 2003) .
With the development of the electric car , the technological innovation has been continuously influenced by several factors primarily in the aspect of environmental and human factor .
Issues pertaining to environmental degradation have already begun to dominate discussions among the world leaders as well as the general population since the early 1990s .
As mentioned by Rogers (2003) , environmental factor is one of the primary issues that led to the production of the electric cars .
Electric cars were created to eradicate the ramifications caused by emissions of carbon dioxide and the smog level in the world .
According to Tyler (2009) , the Ontario Medical Association announced that smog is responsible for an estimated 9 ,500 premature deaths in the province each year .
Hence , it will be beneficial for the creation of the electric cars in the hope of reducing the number of deaths caused by smog .
Furthermore , leaded petrol has been commonly used by the cars consumers in the past .
Depending on the methods used for generating of electricity in electric cars , they have the capability of producing very low emission of carbon dioxide .
It will be possible when more nature energy such as wind and water is used to generate electricity by the turbines compared to the burning of fossil fuels by the power plants .
Thus , with the creation of battery technology generated by electricity , mankind can place greater confidence in new technology to combat environmental issues .
Furthermore , we can not deny the fact that human factor has played a major role in changing the technological innovation of electric car .
Rogers (2003) has pointed out the power in buying interest of test drivers of the electric cars and marketing strategy by GM to create a greater attention on their electric vehicles .
In the article 'Electric cars: On the road to greener transport ?'
(2009) , it discussed about the growing appreciation of the impact that city and regional authorities can have in making practical preparations for an electrified road transport system .
Clearly , the need of the consumers and the government actions are factors that will influence the success and improvement for those technological companies in terms of capital and avenues as well as confidence and morale of the products they sold .
Without the hunger of the unlimited needs in consumers today , technology will not be moving in such a fast pace and may be hampered by the lack of innovation from a lower demand in researchers and engineers .
The process of engineering and designing a new innovation is normally a long and difficult one .
During the process , creative ideas and inventions are brought up and developed upon .
The final product of such a process is usually something that meets the human needs that were first identified and helps make life easier for us .
However , during such a tedious process , there are bound to be problems that may hamper the whole engineering design process .
In Singapore , our small population and education system are two of the main reasons for delays in the process .
Singapore is the smallest nation in Southeast Asia , covering just over 270 square miles and with a population of roughly 4 .7million .
As compared with other innovation powerhouses , for example Japan; which has about 128 million people , Singapore has a very small population .
This lead to factors such as , a limited pool of local talents , a small local market and a lack of volunteers willing to try out new innovations; all of which will affect the engineering design process .
Researching and developing a new product requires a dedicated team of talented researchers with different expertises .
Therefore , in Singapore , it is often difficult to gather such a team due to our small population , which means a smaller group of local talents .
As a result , smaller teams are formed and it inevitably increases the time spent on the whole process .
Furthermore , there could also be a lack of design ideas .
The Singapore government is well aware of this problem and has been trying to attract foreign talents to fill the void .
According to Khandani (2005) , "The net result or purpose of most engineering designs is to produce a product that generates a profit for the company ."
Thus , if there is only a small local market to sell the product , a lot of extra effort will have to be placed to ensure that the final product sells .
The engineering design process will be further delayed because of this extra effort required .
The final effect of having a small population in Singapore is the lack of volunteers willing to try out new innovations .
This is further pointed out in the case of the Haptic Chair (Chua 2009) developed by Suranga Nanayakkara , a PhD student from National University of Singapore .
Mr Nanayakkara had to bring the Haptic Chair back to Sri Lanka for testing because he could not get access to enough deaf children in Singapore .
The lack of testers in Singapore will hamper the fifth step of the engineering design process stated by Khandani , which is the testing and implementation of the solution .
The second problem that affects the process is the education system in Singapore .
The system is successful in educating the masses and is highly regarded by many other countries .
It emphasis mainly on academic performances and students are graded based on their exams .
As a result , there is usually lack of creativity in the students produced through this system .
The impact of having a lack of creativity during the engineering design process is severe as the process requires the generation of multiple solutions .
A workforce that is educated in Singapore will probably suffer as they are not used to answering design questions while they are studying .
Therefore , the process will most likely be hampered due to the lack of creativity in our workforce .
In conclusion , the Singapore government should continue their efforts to bring in more foreign talents and improve the current education system .
Companies should try and promote their local products to other markets and Singaporeans should be more accepting towards new innovations .
All this will lead to Singapore having a greater success in creating new innovations .
In order to handle the energy crisis , the research and development of hydrogen energy is an important section .
How to store hydrogen safely is one of the difficult points among this section , so it should be given priority .
Engineers' innovative design makes contribution to solving such storage issue .
According to Khandani(2005) , engineering design process play an important role .
Because of hydrogen's unique physical property , there are three main problems need to work out .
First , it takes up too much more space for its lightweight .
Second , it escapes too fast .
Third , it is too dangerous for it's inflammably and explosively .
On the one hand , to storage hydrogen under pressure is a rather well-known technique .
However , the use of hydrogen tanks in vehicles , and in particular the challenge of using very high pressures , require advanced technology .
It needs to overcome permeation problem and pass cycling tests .
On the other hand , for solid-state hydrogen storage , it requires materials that can absorb hydrogen quickly and massively .
Furthermore , there are also certain requirements for their reaction .
Overall , these two solutions have their own advantages in different aspects; at the same time , they also have difficulties respectively .
So as to make these two hydrogen storage schemes feasible , a lot of experiments and tests have been done .
For the compressed hydrogen storage , many numerical modeling has been done through computational fluid dynamics tools .
It helps to better under the safety implications of potential accident situations .
And the experiment results came out as well .
For the cycling tests , the filling time is less than 3 minutes and the maximum pressure is 350 bar (will be increased to 700 bar in the near future) .
For the permeation tests , tanks are filled up to 700 bar and the temperatures of ambient and tanks can be controlled up to at least 85c .
For the solid-state hydrogen storage , many testing and performance assessment of potential hydrogen storage materials have been done in laboratory .
Big progress has been made in this field , some new materials have been found and more waiting to be found .
Certain laboratory in European also offers services for research centers and university groups , so as to training and aspiring young .
To sum up , the research and development of the storage of hydrogen will meet human's need and make great contribution for human's getting forward; and the engineering design progress plays important part in it .
Technology is the design or creation of an instrument or an action that lowers the uncertainty in the relationship of cause-effect in achieving a desired outcome .
Many technological innovations were created from scientific researches to solve problems but some were serendipitously invented .
Technological innovations created from scientific researching are created to satisfy a need of to solve a problem affecting people .
Serendipitously created innovations are actually spin-offs from the original plan of research .
Thus an innovation that does not solve the initial targeted problem but solved an unintended problem or need .
Although they had very different outcome , they were triggered by the same motivation to make a better world .
Birth of these two types of innovations had very similar causes , such as pressure from the society or government to cater to certain needs .
Two pieces of technology , for instance , eco-cars and warfarin were products of research and serendipity respectively .
The creation of eco-cars was to address to environmental issues such as global warming and air pollution .
In the early 1990s , the California and Arizona state government demanded that at least ten percent of the total sales of automobile would have to be environmentally friendly .
This resulted in an automobile giant , General Motors (GM) , dedicating $2billion into producing electric cars .
(E .M .Rogers , 2003) This is a case where an innovation is created to cater to the needs by scientific research .
Innovations , regardless serendipity or not , have a common motivation which is to solve surfacing problems in the world .
Electric cars and warfarin alike , they need to be marketed and diffused for potential users to adapt .
Electric cars were marketed extensively through a word-of-mouth process (E .M .Rogers , 2003) arousing a great interest in electric cars .
Also , warfarin was liscenced by Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF) to commercial manufacturer and then used by farmers to eradicate rats where its effectiveness is readily observed .
Both these innovations need to be well marketed and diffused before it can actually solve any problems .
However , the fate of dedicated researched innovations and serendipitous innovations can differ greatly .
One can be almost certain that a serendipitous product will be put into use without much delay as this product is often discovered by another needy party to solve their problems in the process of the initial research .
On the other hand , products through dedicated researching were monitored by a parent organization .
For example , further development of electric cars was dismissed due to the shift of taste of the market towards the "hybrid" gas- and-electric-powered vehicles .
If this product does not provide a satisfactory amount of benefits to the parent organization , it may be dismissed despite its potential usefulness .
In conclusion , innovations are to make life of its user to improve .
No matter how the innovations come about , they have a common sense of motivation .
Through investigation of needs and problems , innovations are made accordingly but unexpected discovery of ideas will lead to innovations of a different kind .
These different kinds will face different circumstances thus a different fate .
Innovations however profitable should not be dismissed but sell to a higher platform where it could spark other ideas or satisfy needs that are not foreseen by the parent organization .
Technology has played a significant role in moulding our lives .
As long as we seek to improve our lives , technology will always exist .
However , this is a period of time where technology will be important in helping mankind to survive on this planet .
Global warming has been identified as one of the greatest threat to our survival , and engineers have tried to solve this issue by coming up with green technology such as solar panels , windmills and dams .
This is a case of technology being socially determined , but modifications in the form of economic factors , military demands and government regulations have occurred , which prevents this technology from being utilised fully .
One of the top priorities of every country on this planet is to ensure the stability of their economy .
For that matter , the use of green technology is not feasible in every country .
Take for example , a country like Singapore , where there are no natural resources available and land-space constraints are always a problem .
Imagine using solar panels to provide electricity for every household .
Given the fact that most households in Singapore share a common block , if the solar panels are fixed on the top of the buildings , will there be enough to provide sufficient electricity for the whole block , which may consists of up to eighty household users .
Given the land constraints , it is definitely a costly as well as non-feasible innovation and only time will tell if this technology can be upgraded into something that can be fitted into a society like Singapore .
Economic factors and government regulations are closely related .
Based on the Madrid article , (Madrid (1995) Diagnosing climate change) John Houghton joked with the leader of Saudi Arabia's delegate party that what he was proposing was against his country's interest , and that he should not be raising it instead .
As we all know , Saudi Arabia's source of income is mainly from the oil industry .
If households all over the world started converting to green technology , there will be a decrease in demand for fuel(since it runs the electricity needed for each household) and as a result a decrease in their countries economy .
This is a case where a country is willing to put aside government priorities for the greater issue on hand , by supporting the use of green technology .
In a bid to counter the issue of global warming , solutions that are socially determined such as solar panels , windmills and dams were created .
Yet the use of it has been restricted by economic factors , military demands as well as government regulations .
Should the day arrive when innovations can be clear of such restriction , only then will the full benefits of it be felt .
In the recent few decades , adverse climate changes and increase numbers of natural disasters have finally made humans realize the impact of human activities on earth .
This ignited a chain of campaigns , activist groups and policies in support of reducing pollutions and wastes to save our planet .
This current situation may seems favorable theoretically for innovations such as the electric car industries to flourish .
However , in reality , the development process of environmental friendly electric cars depends mainly on government policies , social acceptance and cooperation with other related industries .
Decisions made by any industries or citizens in a country is heavily influenced by the policies made by the government .
In the early 1990 , the support given by the California and Arizona state governments on electric cars manages to boost sales of electric cars made by General Motors (Rogers , 2003) .
Besides giving financial aid to R&D departments which helps to initiate the start of the project on electric cars , subsides and incentive may also be given to citizens who use electric cars which would increase the demand for more electric cars .
Such increase in demand would result in companies to increase the supply of electric cars and probably trigger new companies to enter the electric car market .
Thus this increases the rate of development in electric cars .
In conjunction with incentives for electric cars , taxes on pollution inducing cars can also be increased which will motivate people to choose electric cars over petrol cars .
These factors induced by governments decisions truly showed the instigation it has on industries and consumers alike .
Besides government influence , the survival of a new technology also depends on social acceptance of the new product .
In the case of the IMPACT electric cars , the opinion leaders were the ones who stimulated the sales and awareness of these cars (Rogers , 2003) .
Many scientific articles also states that social acceptance is increasingly being recognized as a constraining factor in innovations based on renewable energy sources (Rolf , 2006) .
Without the accession from the society , it would be difficult for the emergent of any new innovations .
This is one of the reasons why marketing strategies such as the use of promotions and advertisements is extremely important in rising the awareness and creating a need for new technologies , thus allowing a new technology to survive .
On the contrary , cooperation between other industries can be equally as important .
For example , if no power supply company is willing to build charging stations for electric cars , it would be impossible for electric cars to exist .
Similarly , if all current gas stations are installed with fast battery charging equipment , electric cars would be more practical and be allowed to travel freely .
Besides the need for electric car companies to work well with their power suppliers , it would be practical for them to work hand in hand with banks and insurance sectors .
An attractive loan and insurance scheme is substantial as it will allow potential customers to buy an electric car , which can have a hefty price tag .
These examples clearly show the significance of the benefits that cooperation between related industries can have on an emerging technology like the electric car .
Ultimately , it is clearly shown to us that there are many factors that can deduce the rate of development of the electric car .
It is thus important for innovators to gain their government's support , get socially accepted and collaborate well with different industries .
In order for electric cars to substitute the current petrol cars , much more have to be done in the mentioned three aspects .
If these factors are not fulfilled , electric cars would still probably ends up as a failed dream .
Engineering design process is the process of coming out with a system to fulfill requirements .
It is a decision-making process , in which the basic sciences , {mathematics}[HYPERLINK: http://en .wikipedia .org/wiki/Mathematics] , and engineering sciences are applied to convert resources optimally to meet a stated objective .
Such engineering designs bring technology together to meet human needs .
One of the many human needs is the security aspect .
Being secure would generally mean the condition of how one feels protected against harm of any sort .
Some examples will be the physical , financial and emotional damage from an event .
The design process comprises the process of defining problems , generating solutions and selecting analyzed solutions , which helps in meeting the need of safety in technology .
In the initial stage , the process allows engineer to identify the needs and subsequently , define the problems involved .
Thereafter , a clear definition of the problem will be reached through the many experiments and data collection done .
For example , in the development of the automobile airbag , potential safety factors contributing to the failure for the inflation of the bags were considered and re-examined throughout the design process .
Also , this is the stage whereby the criteria for the success of the products are considered .
Further emphasis is now placed in meeting the needs initially decided upon , and in this case , the security aspects .
As the stage progresses , multiple solutions are generated to solve the problems defined earlier .
Gathering important information regarding the problem is done initially .
Then , existing solutions to the problems are assessed and combined with other possible solutions to produce better solutions .
This process of tearing and combining is called synthesis .
In relation to the safety aspect , it is through such synthesis that safety will always be improving because better solutions to safety problems are generated .
Finally , it comes down to the decision process of selecting the analyzed solutions .
Selecting of solutions to any of the problems will probably the most difficult stage in the design process .
It starts off with the analysis of every solution generated .
Product safety and liability is one of the analysis factors in determining if the solution is feasible .
This factor is to confirm that using of the design will not cause harm to the users .
For example , one of the questions you will ask yourself frequently is "What are the chances of getting injured during normal use and during the failure of the design ?"
Also , warning labels are introduced to describe the safety guidelines of the design .
Although having warning labels will not keep consumers away from getting injured from the design , it helps in informing them of the potential dangers .
However , there are limitations in the design process in meeting the need of safety .
Firstly , the safety issues discovered were done over the period of century , in the work of thousand of practitioners .
Most of the time , an individual cannot think of all of the safety aspect of a design over few years .
Secondly , generating good solutions to safety issues require creativity and , often , risking safety in the first place to better understand it .
An instance will be the use of animals in the car crash testing before crash dummies were introduced .
Lastly , determining which safety solution is feasible comes with experiences instead of being able to learn it of a book .
Moreover , different teams of engineer may have different point of approach regarding safety issues .
The design process has been the core behind how engineers go about handling new and upcoming problems humanity will face .
It met the many challenges once faced by people and safety is one of the challenges faced .
With better technology and science in the near future , we can definitely expect more from this process in meeting our needs in time to come .
Engineering design is a particular kind of skill that requires an engineer's knowledge and experience .
It is a most effective method to solve the problems we are facing and improve the quality of life .
Engineering design has provided us many conveniences , as tiny as micro-chips in our laptops which have faster processing speed and lower cost , as large as the international transportation .
After we entering the 21st century , our society has come into a new stage with higher productivity and efficiency , which also means that we have more energy requirement at the same time .
For centuries , our major energy came from burning the fossil fuel such as coal , oil and gas .
They have higher quantity of combustion , but they are not reproducible and the resource is limited .
Wood is another energy resource which is reproducible , however , it cannot generate as much heat as fossil fuel , and we destroy the nature also .
According to the Engineering design written by Khandani in 2005 , we can separate the design process into 5 steps .
The first step is to define the problem .
Our problem is very simple----we need more efficient resource to generate enough power for us and last for long time .
At the same time , it must be easy to get and clean , we cannot sacrifice any more .
The second step is to gather the related information .
In a recent research , it shows that traditional resource cannot provide energy for more than 100 years , green house phenomena
becomes more serious .
The new technology gives us many ways to find new source----wave energy , wind energy , solar energy and nuclear energy .
However , in terms of all these sources , they can only provide less than 4% of our power .
That requires engineers to find ways to maximize the efficiency of power generation .
We come to the third step , coming up with multi-solution to the problems .
As we mentioned , they are kinds of new resources to use , solar , wave and nuclear .
We must think about which one is beyond our control and which is better .
We need to follow the step two , analyze all the factors and decide which one we want to choose .
Use nature energy it really good , it is free , it can be found everywhere , such as solar and wind , the bad thing is we don't have the ability to control them .
On sunny day , we have the sun-light , how about rainy or cloudy day ?
In conclusion , engineering process is significant for us .
It applies in our daily life , give more solutions to a same problem .
It supports the society to move faster .
Over the years , we have seen many new technological innovations and inventions .
Some are deem beneficial to mankind , which others are just created for the sake of businessman to reap in business profits .
However , this technological innovation which I am describing has brought about a large change in human life .
It has also brought about much convenience and is now consider an asset to most people .
The technological innovation which I am referring to is the introduction of 3G mobile phones .
In the early 1990s ,mobile phones were first introduced to replace pagers .
Back then , mobile phones could only serve 1 basic function  , and that was just to make basic phone calls .
There was no other functions in a mobile phone .
Apart from being a device with minimal functions , the design and shape of the mobile phone back then was also very ugly .
It was because at that time , the technology was not yet advance enough for manufacturers to come up with cool and sleek designs like the mobile phones nowadays .
It was also very costly to own one .
Hence , not many people were able to afford a mobile phone in the past .
However , take a look at today's society .
Mobile phones have already become a necessity .
Almost everyone owns a mobile phone , including a certain percentage of primary school students .
The phones which people nowadays possess also differs from the past , in terms of functions , design and size .
All these transformation are brought about due to several factors .
Secondly , this technological innovation was brought about by technical improvements in technology .
Over the years , we can see that technology is improving and more people are able to take advantage of it .
Hence , phone manufacturers decided to take a risk by adding a few new features into the mobile phone to see whether is it acceptable in the market .
A typical example is the production of NOKIA 8310 back then in 2002 .
This phone was the first phone in the industry to be equipped with radio function , apart from the basic functions of a phone .
After this production , many other rival brands follow suit .
This thus proves that the society is open and adaptable to new features in the phone .
This was further echoed by the good sales results of this model .
Hence , this thus send a signal to phone manufacturers---the public is more than willing to accept a phone with more functions and will not even mind to replace their previous models for newer ones with added features or functions .
As a result , it give manufacturers incentive to keep up with the times and to always constantly upgrade their mobile phones from point to point .
This is why we are able to see the presence/existence of the 3G mobile phones .
Economic factors also played an important role in this technological innovation .
Over the years , the production of parts for mobile phones has become cheaper .
This could be achieved as manufacturers are able to reap economics of scale as their production size increases .
Hence , as the cost is now lower , manufacturers are then more willing to produce and come up with more features to be added to the mobile phone to attract consumers to purchase it .
This is exactly the case for the production of 3G phones .
People find the 3G phone a useful device as it is able to perform many functions , which inevitably save time and bring about a lot of convenience .
As it has so many functions , it will definitely attract consumers to purchase it .
Since the demand for it is so high , manufacturers will then find it profitable to increase the supply .
This thus lead to the vast production of 3G phones , bringing technology to the next level .
In conclusion , the transformation of mobile phones from a black-grey screen to one that is so highly sophiscated is indeed something remarkable .
This technological innovation cannot be achieved without the factors listed above .
I believe in the near future to come , we are able to expect more innovation and creativity being input in the production of mobile phones .
The society factors such as economic factors , political decision , and technological advancement advertising and even military demands can affects the development of technological innovation .
One very important technology that has been shaped by the society is the development of electric vehicle .
One of the factors that determined and shaped the technological innovation the most is the country economic status .
When people are richer , they will want to own something such as a car to show their social status .
Electric car in the past is very expensive and only the very wealthy people could afford it .
It is a display of social standing when you are seen in an electric car .
Therefore it is more common to see people in cars in those rich countries than those poor countries .
Technological advancement of a country also affects the development of the electric vehicle .
A very important component of the electric vehicle is the battery .
A very powerful battery is needed to powered and run the vehicle for a long time and it is only possible with advance battery technology .
It is only natural that nobody would want an electric car that needs recharging for every few miles it travel .
According to EM Roger (2003) , in the early 1990s , the battery technology can only support the vehicle to travels for 100miles .
For every 100 miles of travelling the vehicle requires 4 hours of recharging to a 220-volt outlet .
Before that the use of electric vehicle was very limited as the battery technology is not available or too costly .
There are many factors that may shape the technological innovation of the technology .
The factors may leave a positive or negative impact on the technological innovation depending on the market and how socially acceptable is the technology at that point of time .
Once such example of a technology that has been shape by it user would be the electric vehicle .
Therefore the society also plays an important role on technological innovation .
People nowadays do not only think of creating tools that can ease their life .
They also need to choose the most efficient technology that can meet their needs .
Furthermore , the processes to create and choose the suitable technology is called engineering design .
One of them is educational problem occurs in every level of academic institution in Indonesia .
The system is not designed to educate students to explore their creativity .
Students are being fed by materials given by the teacher and they are most likely not allowed to learn things in their own way .
For instance , elementary students must follow the step of solving mathematical problems given by the teacher; otherwise they will not get the full score or even considered wrong .
This problem affects the solutions generating process in engineering design .
Since they only have one way to solve an obstacle , they will be fear of problems .
They will not take any risks to find another possibility for the solution of given obstacles .
Khandani (2005) stated that creative people are needed in this stage as they can observe details and in the same time , see the whole picture of the problem .
Based on Khandani (2005) , product safety is an important stage of engineering design , which assures that usage of the design , will not cause any injury to humans .
Khandani (2005) specified that the safety issue can extend to include property and environmental damage .
As we know , recently , there are a lot of fatal accidents have occurred in Indonesia; for example , plane crash and collapsed railway .
Further investigation found out that they were caused by lack of safety and liability test .
They minimize this test because they do not have sufficient fund to support the test .
Living in a society with unprecedented material prosperity , human beings are facing severe problems resulted from energy and resource shortage right now .
In order to sustain a stable development in the next generations , people are paying more and more attention to build up an eco-friendly society which makes energy usage reach an optimum .
Considering the mass energy wastage in transit around the entire globe , one of the approaches to reduce energy usage is to construct a better transportation system that delivers energy more efficiently .
In engineering design processes , the steps regarding solution generation , selection and test are of vital importance to build up such an ideal energy transportation system .
Generating multiple solutions stimulates engineers' creativity and provides impulsion to originate a technological breakthrough .
As Khandani(20005) mentioned in the article "Engineering Design Process" , it is required to investigate the existing solutions , utilize creativity to propose new methods and synthesise all the fresh and ready ideas to come up with a unique and valuable solution .
Such an approach enables engineers to think out of the bounder and challenge the old conventions , and subsequently forges innovative breakthroughs in fields , like transportation system construction , that have hardly experienced any remarkable advancement for decades .
Following the solution generation step , analyzing and selecting a design ensures that the ultimate solution suits best for implementation .
This crucial procedure places all related circumstances into consideration and evaluates the newly-born solutions using a systematic technique (Khandani , 2005) .
Being a project that is closely related to social economy and other critical issues , establishing an efficient energy transportation system urges engineers to identify the overall effectiveness of a certain solution based on the assessment in different fields .
The systematic evaluation approach applied in the engineering design process then facilitates engineers to generate a reliable judgement of the solutions to a large extent .
Lastly , the testing state places the final solution into a real-world practice for further improvement although restrictions exist .
This step allows the solution to be exposed to the real-world variation and yields an even more trustworthy appraisal .
It is also a moment for engineers to investigate the underlying problems in their design and then implement corresponding modification and improvement .
Nevertheless , simulating the real-world variation in accomplishing a huge project like constructing an efficient energy transportation system cannot be fully comprehensive and creating a full-scale prototype of the system is even more unrealistic .
As a result , the effectiveness and some concealed weakness of the design are not able to be fully traced during the test .
To sum up , although imperfection in the accuracy of testing still exists , the solution generating , analyzing and testing steps in engineering design processes play key roles in forging innovative breakthroughs , verifying the feasibility of the design and upgrading the final solution while designing an effective energy transportation system .
Hopefully , the engineering design processes can be further polished in a short term so as to return engineering designs with higher quality .
Throughout the history , many innovations were created not for its intended application .
According to Rogers (2003) , innovation process has six stages: needs/problem , research , development , commercialization , diffusion and adoption , and consequences .
The duration of the process takes many years , or even decades .
Political , social , economic changes during this period would affect the process of innovation .
One of such cases is Global Positioning System (GPS) .
It has evolved from its initial military purposes to the commercialized product that we know today .
Early United States government policy and cold war situation shaped the invention of GPS .
In 1960 , GPS was introduced by US Department of Defense to track down its marine .
Towards its development to today's technology , the policy maker played an important part in it .
In 1973 , when the army , air force , and navy each had its navigation system , the department of defense once again came in and unified the technology .
Furthermore , in 1994 , as the cold war had ended , the US government then decided to fully open the GPS for public use .
The turning point for GPS for civilian use happened at 1983 , when a civilian Korean aircraft was shot down by the Soviet Union for territory trespassing .
It raised needs for a reliable navigation system .
Hence , driven by social concern , President Reagan of the US agreed to partially open the GPS for public use .
Soon after this , when the surveying market boomed in 1980s , the demand for GPS and the money generated also contributes to the development of GPS for civilian use .
In conclusion , political , economic , and social situation normally determine an innovation as shown in GPS .
The GPS would not be possible to be commercialized had the situation was different .
The longer the duration of development , the greater will be the influence of the political , economic , and social situation on it .
Hence , the technology development is partly socially determined .
As modern society is developing fast in the new century , human's need becomes more and more diversified while problems of the shortage of resources get more and more serious .
Such kind of conflict requires engineers to develop new products to meet all needs .
The tasks are never easy for engineers without creativity and innovations; engineers must design products which are both artistic and practical .
Designing products and finding solutions require a long term process , which is defined as engineering design process .
According to Khandani , engineering design process is a very important route for engineers to create products and it can be expressed as a 5-step process , which includes "Define the problem" , "Gather pertinent information" , "Generate multiple solutions" , "Analyze and select a solution" , and "Test and implement the solution" (Khandani , 2005) .
However , there exist some problems that hamper engineering design processes for innovations .
Among them are the problem of plagiarism and the insufficiency of fund support for scientific research .
Although the academic community in my home country is facing many problems hampering innovations , the development of the science and technology has never been pulled down .
I believe that one day all the problems are solved and we get strong enough in academic field .
The main difference between a technology which was developed via research and a technology which resulted from a serendipitous discovery is the extent of the presence of luck .
It is a common knowledge that chance often is a factor in making a discovery (Miller , 1998) .
A serendipitous discovery of technology by its name , suggests that it is an unexpected outcome of a search for solutions to another problem .
It is accidental by nature .
For instance , Dr . Spence Silver , a 3M scientist , intended to produce a super strength adhesive , produced a weak adhesive instead (Connell , 2001) .
This failure was converted into a successful product when a 3M researcher , Art Fry used the bonding agent to create "Post-it" pads (Rogers , 2003) .
On the other hand , a research-based technology is built upon the problem that the inventor has intended to solve .
There is no de-railing of the initial plan .
For example , Tetsuya Mizoguchi saw a need for a portable personal computer in Japan ad invented the first Toshiba laptop computer after several years (Rogers , 2003) .
Comparing the two technologies , it is clear that more elements of luck are present in the former invention than in the latter one .
Nonetheless , luck is not the only determining factor for the birth of a technology , whether it is developed via research or resulted from a serendipitous discovery .
There are other contributing factors such as the efforts of the inventors and their determinations to succeed that lead to the discovery of the technology .
For any technology to be developed , the inventors have to spend a lot of time and effort in their research .
Serendipitous discoveries may be accidental but they are not fortuitous .
They involve a deliberate process of search for a solution to a problem (Cunha , 2005) .
Furthermore , the unanticipated discovery of technology has to be further processed and worked on in order for it to solve another problem .
Dr . Spence Silver spent five years evangelizing the potential benefits of his adhesive invention to internal 3Mers to gain new product development support .
It took another five years for Art Fry to perfect the specifications and design machines to manufacture the product (Connell , 2001) .
Similarly , the inventor of a research-based technology has to conduct multiple purposeful research and overcome numerous challenges before he succeeds .
Mizoguchi invented the first Toshiba laptop computer after several years .
The process of creating the invention was tough as he did not gain the support of the corporate leaders and was denied of development funds and a laptop R&D team (Rogers , 2003) .
Hence for all serendipitous and research-based technologies to be discovered , the inventors have to spend a lot of time and energy in their works .
In addition to the amount of time and energy sacrificed , the inventors must have the perseverance in order to successfully create a technology .
This is an important factor for both research-based and serendipitous technologies .
The inventors are bound to face many obstacles during the process of making their inventions .
For example , 3M leaders showed no interest of the weak adhesive product for nearly five years; however , due to the perseverance and heroic efforts of Silver and Fry , the invention finally gained recognition (Connell , 2001) .
Likewise , Mizoguchi disobeyed the company's orders and risked his career for the sake of innovation-development (Rogers , 2003) .
He believed in his invention and was determined to make it successful .
Both inventors did not give up despite the unfavouring conditions they faced .
Therefore , perseverance is a crucial factor to the discovery of serendipitous and research-based technologies .
In conclusion , whether the technology was created via research or resulted from a serendipitous discovery , the inventor had put in much time and effort into it .
He had to be determined in achieving success as well .
The main difference of the two technologies lies in the element of luck whereby the serendipitous discovery was unforeseen .
Thus the two categories of technologies share many similarities .
Smallpox vaccine was first tested by Jenner in 1796 .
Penicillin was discovered by Fleming in 1928 .
Both of them are important discoveries in medicine .
Hundreds of thousands people are saved by these two discoveries .
There are some similarities as well as differences between these two life-saving discoveries .
Both smallpox vaccine and penicillin are tremendous discoveries that save people's lives and they are milestone in medicine that lead people to explore new areas to fight diseases; however , the procedure of finding these two discoveries and the development of them are different .
One similarity of smallpox vaccine and penicillin is that they are life-saving discoveries in medicine .
In the eighteen century before Jenner discovered smallpox vaccine , smallpox was a widespread killer disease .
Many infants and young children were killed by smallpox at that time .
(Scott , 1996) After Jenner discovered the smallpox vaccine , the death rate of smallpox was close to zero .
Jenner's significant discovery was praised by the third United States Present Thomas Jefferson in his letter 'Letter to Dr . Edward Jenner On is Discovery of the Small Pox Vaccine' .
(Jefferson , 1806) Due to Jenner's discovery , the World Health Assembly officially announced that smallpox was eradicated in 1980 .
(Scott , 1996) Penicillin is an antibiotic that prevent the growth of bacteria and cure infections .
It is the first and most widespread antibiotic to date .
Before penicillin was discovered , many people died of infections .
After penicillin was discovered , the death rate of infection was largely decreased .
During World War II , hundreds of thousands injured people were saved by penicillin .
Another similarity of these two discoveries is that they are landmark in medicine .
Smallpox vaccine is the first vaccine that people used to improve immunity to a certain disease .
After that , people started to develop vaccines to protect people from diseases such as hepatitis B vaccine , BCG and pertussis vaccine .
Similarly , penicillin is the first antibiotic people used to cure infections .
After the discovery of penicillin , people realize that there is a new species of medicine , antibiotic , which can kill bacteria and research are conducted to develop more antibiotics .
More and more antibiotics are discovered and put on production like aureomycin , erycin and chloromycetin .
Both of the two discoveries are milestones that people began to explore new areas to fight diseases .
Although smallpox vaccine and penicillin have those similarities , the procedure and development of these two discoveries are different .
Based on the observation that cowpox prevents smallpox , Jenner began to research into using cowpox to build immunity against smallpox .
After testing his theory , he successfully discovered smallpox vaccine .
(Scott , 1996) In a few years time , his discovery was translated into most European countries languages and smallpox vaccine was applied to prevent smallpox .
In contrast , penicillin is a serendipitous discovery .
Fleming found penicillin almost by accident .
Returned from his holiday to his laboratory in 1928 , Fleming found some penicillium notanum in some lab dishes .
The penicillium notanum can prevent the growth of bacteria .
He named this anti-bacteria chemical penicillin .
(RSC , 2009) However , this discovery was not put on production directly .
Until 1940s , more than ten years after Fleming's discovery , penicillin went into mass production .
In conclusion , smallpox vaccine and penicillin are tremendous discoveries that save numerous people's lives , and they are milestones in medicine .
However , the procedure and development of these two discoveries are different .
In the view of social construction of technology , many technological innovations and inventions are influenced and shaped by social factors (Rogers , 2003) .
Social factors are classified into economic factors , military demands , and government regulations in general .
The values and norms of society significantly influence the process of scientific innovations (Rogers , 2003) .
As illustrated in the article "The Generation of Innovation" (Rogers , 2003) , the process of how the refrigerator got its hum is a typical instance of social construction of technology .
During this process , gas refrigerators with no noise were gradually replaced by electric refrigerators under the influence of social factors .
These factors mainly include the investment of companies , need of customers as well as purpose of saving energy .
First of all , the main reason for this innovation is that the major corporations such as General Electric , General Motors , Kelvinator , and Westinghouse consider that investing in electric refrigerators instead of gas refrigerators would be able to produce more profit (Rogers , 2003) .
Although it was once expected that gas refrigerators would dominate the market , the investment of main corporations has determined the dominant role of electric refrigerators .
In this case , the technological innovation has been driven by the interest of its investors and developed for greater profit for companies .
Furthermore , the evolution of refrigerators is also shaped by the demand of customers .
Refrigerators with better mechanism as well as working capacity are demanded by the market .
The need of customers affected the interests and decisions of investing companies , hence influence the development of refrigerators as well .
In fact , some of the interests of corporations like General Electric are driven by the demand of customers .
What the customers are willing to buy gave rise to the preference of companies .
Production decisions are made to meet the market demand and maximize the profit , and the root of the decisions lies in customers' expectation .
In conclusion , the new generation of refrigerators with no noise is a typical technological innovation which is shaped by social factors .
The decisions by investing corporations , the demand of customers , consideration of energy saving as well as government policies have played important roles in this revolution and the social construction of technology is well reflected .
Many products in the world do not appear from nowhere , but they are made based on the creativity of engineers in the response to human needs .
For instance , the invention of telephone was to help people in long distance communication; airplane was made for shortening travel time; wheel chair enables handicapped to travel around .
Creativity will not stop at one place; it will move on from time to time to improve the appliances or devices .
Therefore , it would be more appropriate now if the engineer design process moves toward human health , in terms of biomedical invention such as artificial heart devices .
Based on Khandani (2005) , there are five phases of design process which will be elaborated in subsequent paragraphs .
The first step of defining the problem is very important so that an engineer would not lost on the way finding the solution .
Therefore , it is necessary to identify the need from this design activity and make a problem statement for the ease of gathering information , choosing a solution and conducting experiment .
In the case of artificial heart devices , materials used and size may be defined as the problems .
With the increasingly globalised world and widespread travelling by people , there is greater mobility .
People can now be travelling to other countries to work .
Hence people also will want greater mobility in their computers , which is why the laptop was invented in the first place .
With the laptop , people can now be working anywhere and anytime , not be chained to their work desks as their desktop computers are not portable at all .
So the companies are competing to develop laptops that are lighter , smaller and pack in more functions and computing power so as to meet consumer demands .
People can now work on the move and be more efficient by multitasking .
But people have unlimited wants , they are not contented with just the laptop with is considered quite bulky at times , thus they demanded laptops that are smaller , lighter .
Just recently , a new class of computing devices emerged .
They are the netbooks .
They are much smaller , lighter than the laptops and can be fitted into small bags comfortably .
They cater to the increasingly mobile workforce with can work anyway on the go as they are able to surf the internet and work on documents .
This functionality comes only at a fraction of the cost and weight of the laptops .
Hence there are people willing to buy the netbooks .
Hence this shows that the consumer factor also influenced the development of laptops to a great extend .
The laptop is indeed an important technology that is shaped by economic and military factors , and consumer demands .
These are the main reasons behind the social forces that shape development of this technology .
Companies will want to create a product that is demanded by the world so as to make profits to survive .
And people's wants and desires are unlimited so as to fuel this continuing development of this technology .
Perhaps the future laptops will shrink to the size of palmtops but with greater computing power as people demanded laptops that can be fitted into their pockets .
According to the article "The History of Electric Vehicles" , Robert Anderson of Scotland invented the first crude electric carriage between 1832 and 1839 .
However , having been popularity for less than 100 years , Electric vehicles had all disappeared by 1935(The History of Electric Vehicles ,2009) .
After 65 years , electric cars came back again from America; however , unfortunately and interestingly , they failed again .
Rogers indicated in his article "The Generation of Innovations" that the innovation-decision process is very crucial to the adoption of a new technology , because not only technique factors but also economic , political and social factors play an important part .
Therefore , it is the technique , economic , political and social factors that killed electric cars together .
Electric cars have a very obvious shortage in their technique design .
The electric cars invented in 1990 did not have a powerful battery .
Due to the limitation of its weigh , size and the battery technology , the battery used in the electric cars at that time was limited to a range of 100 miles (Rogers ,2003) .
As a result , they are not convenient enough .
Instead , Hydrogen fuel cell was brought up to substitute the electric battery .
Economically , the consumers , the car companies and some oil companies were not very satisfied about electric cars .
In order to improve the air condition , consumers had to spend more and compromised on limited range of electric cars .
And since the electric cars did not have engines and some other complements , the car companies could no longer benefit from the maintenances of those cars .
As for the oil companies , apparently , they could not make money from oil , if all the engine cars were substituted by electric cars .
Moreover , the main stream of the government did not approve of this inventor .
Although the California and Arizona state government came up with the mandating that "at least 10 percent of the total sales of automobile companies would have to be nonpolluting"(Rogers ,2003) , they had to cancel the command since the electric vehicles failed to act in the public interest .
Moreover , the federal stepped in this case to oppose the California and Arizona state government .
In the article "The Generations of Innovations" written by E .M . Rogers , social construction of technology is defined as technology that is shaped by social factors .
In this essay , I will use the invention of internet as an example to show how this important technology was determined initially by a specific group of users , mainly government and military personals , and later commercialize into today's daily usage .
Unlike the development of some inventions like Post-its which was resulted from serendipity , the internet was a strategic innovation that was initiated by the government and developed by their researchers .
In order to understand the reasons for the need of Internet by U .S . government , we will need to understand the history background during the middle of twentieth century .
During the Cold War period , the world politics was divided between democracy and communism .
In the 1950s , the Soviet Union tested their first atomic bomb resulting in the world having two nuclear super powers that were conflicting with each other over world political dominance and military superiority .
This inevitably sparks of the arms race .
Meanwhile , the growing dominance of Soviet Union over Eastern Europe also threatened the position of the U .S . as the world's most powerful nation .
A series of policies containing containment and deterrence of the rising influence of communism were implemented .
The Cold War and arms race stimulated the research and development of all technological fields in the U .S . including improving communication infrastructure between the government and military planners .
In 1961 , Paul Baran , who is a member of RAND Corporation , was commissioned by the Department of Defense to do research on networking .
Baran and his colleagues developed an entirely different method of communication called packet switching .
The principle behind packet switching was that data would be broken down into datagrams or packets that were labeled to indicate the origin and the destination of the information .
The packets were then be forwarded from one computer to another computer until the information arrived at its final destination computer .
The packets would be encoded as electrical signals , light , or radio waves and transmit via copper cables , fiber-optic strands and the ether; which consists of microwave , satellite , or radio transmissions .
This was important part of a computer network .
In situations where packets were lost at any given point , the message could be resent by the original user .
As a result of decentralization , packet switching , unlike the telephone system , will not break down when one part of the network systems is faulty since the packets can be rerouted until it arrived at its intended destination .
In order to destroy this decentralize communication system , all the channels of transmission will have to be destroyed .
Three years later , J .C .R .
Licklider , a researcher under Advance Research Project Agency (ARPA) proposed that computers were the keys to network communication .
With the inclusion of computers as a link to network communications , a system of protocol had to be created to standardize network communication .
The interface message processor (IMP) became part of the actual language that linked computers to the network; it defined how they would connect , route and verify the messages received .
Thus the IMPs , together with the telephone lines , and data sets would constitute a 'message-switching network .'
The protocols would define the communications formats between the IMP's and became the format through which all the computers in a network were connected to .
The following two decades witness the improvisation and spread of networking .
Network Control Protocol (NCP) was developed by VInt Cerf and Bob Kahn in 1973 to allow network communication of people using different hardware .
Consequently , networks were able to connect to different parts of the world .
For instance in 1973 , the U .S . has connected its network to both the United Kingdom and Norway .
In the mid 1970s , networks began to spread to research universities across America and internationally .
The governments of France , Japan , Germany and other European nations also developed research networks .
In the early 1980s , there was a growing demand for network usage by researchers and students .
However , it was costly to be part of the ARPANET because ARPANET had a tight control on the usage of network .
The frustrated Duke students Tom Trusscott and James Ellis , and Steve Bellovin , a student at UNC , created Usenet .
Within a few years , there were more postings and news groups than the system could handle .
By 1982 , there were hundreds of postings a day to as many different news groups .
Usenet was much more popular than ARPANET .
Although there were over 230 ARPANET sites in 1982 , Usenet take less than two years to reach that number .
The popularity of Usenet was due to the fact that it was inexpensive and provided semi-anonymous communication through which people could share their ideas .
This resulted in hundreds of discussion groups , each discussing different subjects  , which range from politics to daily life experience .
The explosive growth of network usage resulted in all of the networks to switch from NCP to TCP/IP in 1983 .
The new TCP/IP protocol was able to deal with the increased electronic traffic of the developing Internet .
In 1987 , the National Science Foundation , which has funded a program earlier in 1984 to create national infrastructure to provide a variety of academic institutions access to a larger national academic network , backed away from funding the Internet and allowed giant corporation such as IBM , MCI and Merit Corp to manage and support the infrastructure it had funded .
It was not until 1993 where the Internet was transformed from government-funding to commercialization by private sectors .
With the creation of World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN , the European Nuclear Research Centre , the World Wide Web opened up a new era of individualism and creativity that will change the information age once and for all .
In conclusion , it was the historical background during the era of Cold War that prompted the US government to consider new ways of creating indestructible communication to enable the political and military leaders to communicate with each other during a nuclear attack .
Through the works of brilliant researchers , the Internet , which has limited to a few users at first , was improvised to accommodate increase electronic traffic and finally commercialize to be available to each and individual of us .
Technology is an act of designing and inventing of a tool that will either solve a problem recognized or fulfill a particular human need , in other words it is a product of society .
According to Rogers (2003) , the success of the invention is full of uncertainties as the responses from other parties involved , such as the society or government , are not predictable .
If the product is not accepted by consumers or widely used , the product has failed socially .
There are many factors that contribute to the failure of a product socially and one of them is the economic factor which monopolizes the consumer market .
The case study on Cowan (1985) is a representative example of failure of product due to economic factor , in which a aggressively advertised product is preferred over the other that can bring much more advantages .
Cowan (1985) discussed about the two types of refrigerators developed , the electric refrigerator and the gas refrigerator .
The gas refrigerator should have been more preferred by consumers since it brings along overwhelming advantage but it turned out to be otherwise .
The extensive promotion of the electric refrigerator , which its research and development investment was funded by corporations , influenced the choice of consumers since the gas refrigerator was not widely promoted and made known to consumers .
Such cases are typical examples of how a technological invention is shaped by economic factor , in which the technology made available to the consumer was directed by corporations' profits earned instead of offering the one that benefits consumer most .
One of the reasons behind such situations is probably due to corporations' fear of losing their share of the market and thus suppresses new technology to minimize chances of it happening .
This , however , affects consumer's acceptance of inventions directly , in which the choice made will then be economically driven rather than based on the usefulness of inventions .
Another contributing factor of the success of invention will be the buying power of consumer , which very much depends on the economic situation then .
In times of economic recession , it is of lower tendency for consumer to purchase the more expensive refrigerator when both have the same primary functions that is to store up food at low temperature .
For that , the competition among corporate and the extent of price slashing they are willing to offer such that they still earn an amount of considerable profit may help improve consumer's acceptance of their product .
Therefore , it can be concluded that functionality may not be only determining factor to the success of technology since it may not be the priority of consumer's concern , but rather how the technology is commercialized and diffused to the public or society .
As such , technology nowadays needs not only to prove its functionality but also spend efforts on creating its awareness since it is up to the consumers , who come in contact with many advertisements in their life and is eventually conditioned , to make the decisions .
Due to the flourishing of construction industries over the years , the construction industries worldwide consume resources equivalent to more than what the nature are able to produce on Earth .
In this rate of consumption , our environment will not be able to supply us with sufficient resources years down the road .
In order to compensate and preserve the right of nature , there is a need to implement a system whereby waster construction materials can be treated and re-used .
This implementation will help protect the environment by controlling amount of resources consume; reduce cost of manufacturing and importing of raw materials; reduce the cost of construction and even maximise economy advantages .
The process of recycling of construction waste involves separating and reusing recoverable and useable waster construction materials during demolition .
The advantage of this treatment system not only will produce low-cost recycled materials , it may also produce new composite of materials with better characteristic .
However , few considerations should be taken into account during the design process .
During the remodelling of buildings most construction waste goes into landfill , hence increases burden on the landfill loading .
These wastes may be high in chemical content which result in water and soil pollution .
Whereas some can be recycled and re-use as similar material while others to be reconstituted to other form of usable materials .
Moreover , recycling which need reprocessing may not be economically feasible because it requires a facility using recycled resources to be located near the source .
Thus , site separation is an important step for recycling of construction waste .
Although initially it requires extra effort and training , once separation habits are set up , it can be done at very low cost .
The world today is changing continuously where it faced many global challenges and problems .
As a result , technologies have been constantly developed in order to response to human needs .
Once the needs are identified , ideas have to be developed through research .
Example of such technology is the development of tomato- harvesting machine where an agricultural scientist at the University of California at Daris predicted there will be a serious shortage of the labour in California (Rogers , 2003) .
However , technologies can also be created through serendipitous discovery .
As the name implies , it is a new discovery of a valuable idea by accident .
One example is the discovery of the Penicillin by Sir Alexander Fleming where he realized the presence of the antibacterial agent while researching on influenza .
This leads to the birth of the Penicillin which is widely used as antibiotics (Mary Bellis , About .com) .
Although the two technologies are created in a very different approach , both have to undergo the innovation-development process where the final product can be marketed .
According to Rogers (2003) , the innovationdevelopment process consists of all the decisions , activities , and their impacts that occur from recognition of a need or a problem through research , development , commercialization of an innovation , through diffusion and adoption of the innovation by users to its consequences .
Therefore it is extremely time-consuming to develop a new technology .
For a technology that is deliberately invented , it generally requires much a longer time frame as compared to those fortuitous discoveries .
This is because inventors had to generate multiple solutions to solve for the problem identified .
Much research has to be prepared so that the best solution could be found .
In the case of the tomato harvesting machine , there are plenty of factors that need to be consider .
If the tomatoes have to be harvested by a machine , they have to breed hard tomato varieties so that they will not be crushed .
However in the case of the serendipitous discoveries , identifying a problem or need as well as selecting the best solution are eliminated .
Hence the total time consumed is much shorter compared to the technology develop through research .
However , no matter whether it is created intentionally or unintentionally , both required the ability to think creativity and innovatively as well as some coincidence and luck .
In the case of a deliberate technology , inventors must not restrict themselves to only one solution but exposed themselves to the various possible solutions .
These solutions have to be analyzed and research further until the best solution is found .
If luck is presence with coincidence , the best solution will be generated in a shorter time .
Similarity , the person must have the ability to view things in a different perspective , have sufficient background knowledge about the serendipitous discoveries and some luck for serendipitous discoveries to take place .
Since fortuitous discovery often occurs while research was carried out in a totally unrelated field , they must be able to identify the technology that came by accidentally .
In conclusion , the fundamental of inventing a new technology is to meet the needs of human .
Regardless of how technologies are developed , they will definitely benefit people .
Developing a new technology usually requires plenty of time , therefore creative thinking and innovation is required .
In addition , luck and coincidence must be presence for the discovery to happen at the right time , right place and to the right person .
With all these factors , the time taken to develop a new technology will be shorted .
Rogers (2003) brought forward the idea that society is coming to a generation of innovation , which implicates that innovation is gradually becoming the main tasks of various enterprises and scientific research .
In every day's newspaper , it is usual to find news regarding some enterprise adopting a new technology .
However , the products in market are not updating as fast as the innovation introduced to the public .
This is because the innovation in technology is not only technologically decisive but also socially decisive .
Social factors include economic factors , military demands , government regulations and so on .
Usually , a new technology will be tested by more than one factor and the results will directly affect the future of the new technology .
Firstly , the new technology must satisfy consumer's needs .
Before the refrigerator was introduced to market in a mass , there was a competition between two prototypes of refrigerator .
The old type has a motor that drives a compressor that condenses a liquid , releasing heat into the surrounding environment that the liquid had previously absorbed inside the refrigerator when the liquid vaporized .
A superior alternative is the gas refrigerator , in which the ammonia refrigerant is vaporized by heating it with a gas flame .
Later , the refrigerant dissolves in water , thus cooling the refrigerator box .
The gas refrigerator has no moving parts and hence is unlikely to break down .
Furthermore , the gas type hardly has noise , which solves the most severe problem regarding the noise (Cowan , 1985) .
Because of these overwhelming advantages , people expected that gas refrigerator would dominate the consumer market .
However , it was defeated by electrical refrigerators because of some other factors
The example of refrigerator competition interprets that whether to adopt a new technology depends on other social factors other than consumers' needs .
To continue the previous example , the reason why gas type lost in the competition is due to the high research and development cost , several dominant cooperation thought electrical refrigerators would make more profit , then they invested large amounts of money in producing electrical refrigerator and developing market .
The aggressive occupancy of market compelled smaller companies which prefer producing gas refrigerator give up .
In this way , gas refrigerators were washed out of the market .
Whether a new technology will be popularized usually depends on more than one factor .
Mostly , they will give reverse responses after considering in different angles , but people can still make decisions based on the more crucial factor or the factor they concerned the most .
Apart from consumers' need and producing cost , other factors like environmental problems , military demands and government regulations also affect the adoption of a new technology .
The earth is experiencing water deficit .
Unlike burning forests or volcanic eruptions , the falling of water tables throughout scores of countries cannot be readily photographed , it is largely invisible .
However , in recent years , this are observed by an increasing number of droughts , dried-out wells , and unavoidably , a change in climate pattern across the globe .
We are now consuming water that belongs to the future generations .
The high demands and misuse of water are increasing .
Man has since been working , vastly through engineering efforts , to manage water resources .
According to Khandani (2005) , engineering is the creative process of turning abstract ideas into physical representations (products or systems) .
In the last few years , engineers had indeed innovatively managed and minimized water deficit in many countries by conveying solution ideas into engineering designed products and systems .
Water treatment has largely been classified as one engineering process which turns used-water into clean , acceptable water for end use , and sometime even drinkable water .
Dirty water are usually collected through piping systems from lakes , drains and household , and transported to a treatment plant .
In the treatment plant , the dirty water is separated from solid particles by settling and filtration .
After which they will be treated and purified by various sub-processes such as reverse osmosis , distillation , chemical disinfection and some others .
All of these engineered processes will produce a cleaner effluent .
Further treatment can even turn dirty wastewater into drinkable water .
The 'Newater' treatment plant in Singapore is a global example of water treatment .
Water can be stored , treated and finally even transported .
Water transportation is made possible through engineered piping system .
Large water pipes are constructed to constantly transport water from a storage dam to dried-up lands .
This allows for a good system of irrigation by providing transported water to the dried soil continuously .
This process and system assist in the growing of crops in dry area especially during periods of inadequate rainfall .
With such engineering designs , deserts can be turned into green pastures with rich crops .
It is amazing how science and technology through man's engineering efforts have benefited the world .
We are now facing a crisis of water shortage which could lead to many water related problems .
Engineers in recent years have been working creatively and innovatively to properly treat and managed water .
With the advancement in technology , these are all made possible and there are even purified drinkable water treated from wastewater .
In certain countries , dried-out lands are even brought alive through water irrigation , where water are stored up somewhere and constantly transported through pipes to these lands .
Engineering products and systems designs are not simply a design of aesthetical purposes , but also technologically meeting some of the greatest needs of human , water deficit .
Inventions are made to benefit mankind .
However , some inventions were made accidentally while others look into the problem directly to develop a new product .
From five aspects - discovery , creativeness , time taken , acceptance of the project by company and also from problem solving - we can see that there are similarities and difference in these two approaches .
The examples I am using for this essay for serendipitous discovery and developed via research is 3M Post-it pads and Toshiba Laptop respectively .
One obvious difference is the way it is invented .
One of the well-known accidental inventions , according to E .M . Rogers (1950) , happened several decades ago , 3M researcher found a new bonding agent , but decided it was worthless because it did not stick paper very tightly to a surface .
This failure converted into a successful product when a 3M researcher used the new bonding agent to create "Post-it" .
As for Toshiba laptop is developed via research , Mizoguchi foresee that portable personal computer can be invented when he visit the United States with an R&D team form Toshiba .
He was certain to make it came true .
Creativeness is always one of the important factors in inventing things .
An accidental discovery requires a member of the team to think of the product related during another process of making another product .
This person must be able to think out of the box .
But for Mizoguchi , he has set his target on developing a laptop .
However , both inventions require creative thinking in order to produce excellent product .
We can see from the above , inventing things is not an easy task .
Each of the findings has it difficulties .
Be it serendipity or developed through research inventions , it benefits to human lives .
In the world today , most humans are leading convenient and comfortable lives .
This is made possible due to the innovations engineers have produced to improve on the lives of mankind .
What is the engineering design process that produced so many useful innovations like ?
According to khandani , S .(2005) , engineering design consists of five steps: defining the problem , gathering information , brainstorming for solutions , selecting the best solution and finally the implementation of the solution .
These are the general steps to the formulation of an innovation .
This process requires certain skills from the engineer , such as creativity , ability to learn from failure .
In singapore , the local society and education system produces problems that hinder the usage of the engineering design process .
The first problem will be the focus of the Singapore education system .
It has evolved over the years , from textbook learning to the introduction of hands-on learning to equip students with skills such as creativity .
However , the implementation of hands-on learning is only carried out to a small extent .
learning is still heavily dependent on textbooks today .
In addition , education in singapore is fast paced and result orientated .
From primary schools to junior colleges , lecturers are always rushing through lessons in order to be able to finish the syllabus on time .
Whether students learned or not depends on the outcome of major examinations such as GCE 'O' and 'A' levels .
These exams do not concentrate on the learning process .
Instead , it focuses on the answers .
With such an education system in place , what students learn are confined to what the textbook offers , with minimal development of critical skills such as creativity and analysis .
This trend will impede the engineering design process at the brainstorming and selection of solution stages .
In the brainstorming stage , the innovator must be able to think of solutions that are non-existant in reality .
This requires alot of creativity .
Next , the selection of the best solution requires the innovator to possess strong analytical skills .
These skills are critical to the two stages of the design process , but is lacking in locals due to the effect of the education system .
Another problem faced in singapore is society's mindset .
Life in singapore is highly competitive and fast paced , hence parents believe that their children must possess outstanding paper qualifications to survive .
As a result , they enroll their children in tuition classes to enhance their academic performance , depriving them of the chance to develop their critical skills .
Moreover , majority of the locals are apathetic to their surroundings .
Everyone minds their own business , and do not bother themselves with what happens around them , unless it concerns them .
In the current state of society  , people are not adept at analysing information and observing problems , and even if they did , they will deny its presence .
This behaviour will jeopardise the steps where the problem is defined and the selection of the best solution .
To be able to define a problem , the innovator must be observant enough to see the problem , and bothers to do something to improve it , hence creating an innovation .
The skills are vital to the two stages of the process , therefore society's mindset poses a problem to the design process .
In conclusion , for Singapore to have outstanding innovators , the problems in the education system and the mindset of society must be addressed .
People must be more creative , able to think analytically and change their mindsets .
However , two problems are not the only problems that will impact the design processes negatively .
There are other problems that require attention .
With these problems rectified , then Singapore will have more innovators , and hopefully more useful innovations to improve people's lives .
Global warming is a threat that we are becoming more anxious about .
One of the causes of this environmental degradation is from carbon emissions , especially , carbon emissions emitted from car exhausts .
Hence , the electric vehicle is an important technology as it is a possible alternative and replacement for future cars .
The electric vehicle wins over the petroleum vehicle as it produces less carbon emissions .
Being an environmentally-friendly vehicle , it should be a popular choice .
However , they are poorly adopted and according to Autodata , electric vehicles only make up 2 .8% of today's cars .
Thus , it is likely that the popularity of electric vehicles is socially-determined .
Economic , governmental and psychological factors could have shaped this technological innovation .
One factor that has shaped the electric vehicle is the economics of owning an electric vehicle .
Cost is a major consideration in a consumer's decision-making process .
The maintenance cost when the electric vehicle was first introduced was high .
This made the electric cars more expensive than petrol-run cars .
For instance , the battery pack in typical electric cars did not last long .
According to Gruening (1995) , the battery pack had to be replaced every 20 ,000 to 30 ,000 miles .
Consequently , this made the electric vehicles more expensive than petrol vehicles and hence less affordable to most families on a budget .
Besides the low lifespan of the batteries , the time required to recharge an electric vehicle was much longer than the time required to refuel a fuel tank .
For many , time wasted waiting would translate to high opportunity cost .
Thus , these economic factors could be reasons why electric vehicles were poorly adopted .
Besides economic factors , government regulations and laws also played a part in shaping the electric vehicles .
The California and Arizona state governments , in the 1990s , mandated that at least 10 percent of the total sales of automobile companies would have to be non-polluting .
Rogers(2003) notes that these laws prompted General Motors to invest in the designing , manufacturing and marketing of the electric vehicle .
As a result , the concept of the electric car was widely promoted in the United States of America .
In addition , tax rebates and incentives added on the attractiveness of buying an electric vehicle .
For example , the Climate Change Bill in the United States included incentives to set up charging stations and subsidies for people buying the cars .
These offer made by the government made these vehicles competitive to the petroleum cars in prices .
Therefore , it can be seen that the government's involvement in promoting environmentally-friendly vehicles affected how marketable electric vehicles are .
Moreover , psychological factors of owning an electric vehicle have affected the outcome of the electric vehicles in the market .
A technical limitation of the electric vehicle the range of travel it can offer .
An electric vehicle with a fully-charged battery is not able to travel as far as a petroleum vehicle with a fully-filled fuel tank .
Although families who needed a car as a mode of transport did not usually require traveling for long distances , there is a psychological perception of having their freedom being restricted .
Hence , they will prefer a petroleum car which has a potential in allowing them to travel farther .
Thus , the strong desire for freedom might have affected the popularity of the electric car .
In short , there are several factors that could have shaped the electric vehicles .
Economic and psychological factors might have dissuaded many from supporting them while the government plays a prominent role in encouraging the growth of the electric vehicle industry .
However , there is a close relationship between the social factors and the technical challenges that the electric vehicles face .
Hence , the recognition of electric vehicles by society could be affected by both social factors and challenges faced in the present technology of the electric vehicle .
As Khandani(2005) points out , innovations are designed to meet human needs .
Human needs and problems are the motivation of conceiving of new ideas and designing new products .
In Singapore , and other countries next to the equator , air conditioners and electric fans have greatly contributed to people's life and people are able to enjoy cool and refreshing in burning hot days .
Throughout human history , people have conceived of many ways to get rid of heat in hot weather .
The design process of electric fans and air conditioners is a process in which engineers make designs to meet people's needs .
From the very primary fan to the electric fan , and all the way to the air conditioner , engineering designs gradually solve the problem and meet people's needs .
In ancient time , heat and humidity tortured people a lot .
In hot days , people felt physically uncomfortable and mentally irritable .
The working efficacy was low and diseases transmitted easily .
People began to think of ways to solve the problem .
Some great minds , probably the engineers in those days , created fans .
Fans were generally made by leathers or palm leaves sewed together .
The fan basically combined the theory of flowing air and wind , but it was a great success and everybody uses fans to generate breeze and keep cool in summer .
It relieves the discomfort in summer .
http://www .iisme .org/etp/HS%20Engineering-%20Engineering .pdf
Gradually , people were not satisfied by fans , since they had to keep shaking fans to keep cool .
It was disturbing to shaking a fan at work or in sleep .
At the same time , electricity was invented and people began to appreciate the convenience brought by it .
In 1886 , Schulyer Wheeler (Inventors , 2009) devised a new type of machine using electricity to send breeze .
After careful design and hard process of trials and fails , the first electric fan was created .
The advent of electric fan was a great success and it was implemented around the world .
People's need was met by the air vortex flow formed automatically .
The electric fan was the standard at that time .
Now electric fans and air conditioners are better designed than the original ones .
People feel more comfortable in hot days .
Productivity is increased and industries flourish .
The design was initiated by people's needs , and they ultimately met people's needs .
It is believed that the design will not end there so that more advanced products will appear .
More developed and enhanced functions will be added and improve people's life better and better .

Technology innovation is significant to the world .
Without it , our society could not have progressed , nor would our life become convenient .
According to Roster (2003) , technology innovation development is a process begins with recognition of a problem or need , which arouses research and development activities designed to create an innovation to solve the problem or need .
Five stages can describe this process: problem , research , development , commercialization diffusion and consequences (Roster , 2003) .
While , different countries have different way to perform these stages .
So during the process , they encounter different obstacles , such as political issues , financial issues .
In China , currently two factors which are education system and economic situation that hamper the technology innovation process severely .
Look around and you would most probably notice people driving in their cars , talking on their phones or busy typing away on their personal computers .
These occurrences may seem common now , but they were definitely not in the early 1900s .
The advancement of technology over the last century was so breathtaking that one often wonders how the technologies were invented .
Were they created conventionally , which means that the general public knows about their development , or were they secretly developed in a skunkworks environment ?
Regardless of their distinctions , both technologies share similarities that make each of them unique and useful in their own ways .
The most significant contrast between the skunkworks technology and that of the conventional method is the vastly different confidential levels and aims which each technology works on .
In the case of skunkworks , the product being developed is known only to the researchers and the relevant organizations .
This ensures that the probability of information leakage regarding the product is kept to a minimum , so that the main objective of creating the product can be realized .
For example , Lockheed's P-80 Shooting Star fighter jet , which was designed and built under the knowledge of only the researchers and the United States military , helped the US overcome the technology gap which Germany had over it during World War 2 .
On the other hand , corporations using conventionally generated technologies usually announce to the public their latest updates pertaining to their most recent creations .
The release of information is usually done by companies which wanted to flaunt their superiority over other similar companies competing in the same market .
The rivalry between Sony and Microsoft over the gaming console industry leads to both companies constantly improving their products and announcing it to the world so as to apply pressure on the other .
Thus , it can be seen that differing degrees of secrecy for disparate technologies stems from dissimilar aims .
Another difference between the two technologies is the impact that they create when both are in operation .
New innovations contrived in skunkworks environment usually revolutionize the world and propel the company which invented it to new heights while that is not the case for conventional technology .
The invention of personal computers in IBM's skunkworks completely changed the way in which the world operates , and made IBM the forerunner in computers , but the upgrading of the computers with ordinary technical knowledge did not really lead people onto a new path , instead it only results in the proliferation of many small computer-based companies .
As a result , the market is now full of computers with different brands .
This maybe the unexpected positive side effect of using conventional technology , but compared to the skunkworks , it is relatively insignificant .
Despite of the differences , both technologies share some common traits .
First , both require a high level of accuracy .
There is not much room for error in both cases , as a slight mistake may result in devastating effects .
The skunkworks-produced P-80 fighter jet experienced numerous crashes , which resulted in many deaths , due to problems which were not analyzed accurately .
Similarly , the HIV vaccine was not researched adequately , causing many volunteers to contract the virus unwillingly .
Second , products that emerge from both technologies can be used for a long time .
It is important as this means that resources can be channeled to other areas of research .
Using the previous examples , the P-80 jet was used for close to 30 years before being replaced completely , while the HIV vaccine may be in use forever if the vaccine undergoes successful researches .
It is through these similarities that people can compare and advance on the current technology .
To sum it up , the major differences between skunkworks and conventional technology is the ripples which both technologies produce and the secrecy in which they are required to observe .
These are features that make each technology unique in its own way .
However , both technologies also possess similarities like the stringent levels of accuracy and the lifespan of the products generated , which shows that features can be adopted by more than one form of technology as long as it is beneficial .
Having a home is one of the most fundamental human needs .
Be it a shelter or a big house , everyone has to have a place they can call home .
Despite being a fundamental need , there are many people in the world who are unable to have a proper home .
According to the UN Human Settlements Programme , there are around a billion people out there who live in overcrowded housing with poor water quality , lack of sanitation , and no garbage collection .
With rapid urbanization and the world population increasing into the future , housing would prove to be a challenging issue .
A proper housing system has to be set up to deal with these housing issues and the best way to develop such a system would be using an engineering design process .
The main steps to consider in a good and proper housing system are the affordability , durability and safe living conditions .
Hence the main solution to the problem of improper housing would be the reduction of housing cost without compromising on quality .
Homeless people suffering from housing issues are mainly attributed to problems of affordability .
Building proper houses or flats usually require much finance .
The construction cost bundled with the raw materials for building many homes is something , which the poor cannot afford .
Furthermore , developers have no incentive to carry out projects in these less developed countries , as there is just no market to earn profit from .
The problem of cost clearly creates more homeless people .
On being unable to obtain a proper home , squatters are the next and only alternative that the homeless can approach to .
These make-do houses are built cheaply and improperly on wastelands .
Being made from waste metal and wood , the durability and safety of the inhabitant are usually compromised .
These shabby houses have a danger of collapsing with the constant battering of the weather .
Moreover , health dangers are prevalent when certain waste materials are used in the shelter construction according to an article , by Environmental Health Perspectives , Give Me Shelter: The Global Housing Crisis .
Furthermore , squatters in the slums do not have proper sewer system and a clean water source .
Such living conditions are detrimental to society but they are not unavoidable as measures can be taken to rectify these problems .
There are many other processes that can be applied to solve this issue , but I strongly feel that an engineering design process will be the best approach .
Despite being a big stepping-stone to solving the urgent housing crisis , the gaining of support and acceptance from the government of the countries affected will be vital for carrying out this process .
Ultimately , the success of the entire process is one that requires a holistic approach that involves more than the designing of a feasible process , but extends to the community and its government support .
Since entering the 21st century , mankind is faced with a growing number of challenges and threats .
Global warming , the War in Iraq and even the threat of China's rise are all inextricably linked with the need for energy .
Global warming is partly caused by the overuse of fossil fuels and the War in Iraq is mainly resulted from the need of petroleum of USA , while the threat of China actually refers to China's huge demands of resources including energy resources to satisfy the high-speed development of China .
Therefore , among all the current human needs , the need of energy , in my opinion , should be given priority .
In meeting this need , engineering design processes takes an important role .
First of all , engineering design processes help to make good use of new energy resources like hydrogen energy and solar energy .
As we know , the storage and transport of hydrogen have been two major factors that restrict the wide use of hydrogen .
Engineers need to find right materials and design a suitable container for hydrogen so that it can be safely transported and stored .
In terms of solar energy , to improve the utilization and reduce the cost of use is a problem leaves for engineers .
In China , millions of families have already used solar water heater for years , which saved considerable electricity .
However , when trying to convert solar energy into electricity so that it can be easily transmitted , engineers should consider the cost and utilization of solar panels .
Otherwise , it would be an embarrassing situation that the saved energy cannot pay the cost of solar panels , which would make solar energy no market .
Next , traditional fossil fuels can be better used with the help of engineering design processes .
In the process of exploitation of fossil fuels , engineering design helps to find scientific methods to improve resource recovery and reduce resource wasting .
In addition , deep processing of fossil fuels also needs engineering design to improve utilization of fossil fuels .
By doing so , the pollution caused by using fossil fuels can be reduced .
For example , during the process of exploiting oil , the byproducts like natural gas are often burned since it is hard to collect and stored .
Japan has developed the Heat Recovery Steam Generator to generate power by using the waste heat .
Engineering design has played an important role in developing HRSG .
Last , engineering design processes can help to reduce the waste of energy .
When transmitting electricity , some energy is consumed by the wire .
Engineers are trying to find a superconducting material that can work in room temperature to take place of traditional conducting material .
In this way , the energy consumed by the wire will be saved .
Furthermore , the energy- saving appliances designed by engineers have saved inestimable energy for the world .
Engineering design processes have made a great contribution to the world .
In the coming years , human's demand for energy will be increasing whereas renewable energy source are decreasing .
Engineers have compelling obligation to solve this problem .
With the breakthroughs of different domains of science , engineers should shoulder up the responsibility of making these breakthroughs available for people therefore benefit humankind .
The survival of humanity in this century is heavily dependent on the role of Engineers and we should be prepared for potential threats and challenges .
Like many other gadgets created in the 21st century , surveillance technology such as RFID has also made its way into our ever changing lives .
Apart from its many other applications in the business and medical sectors , RFID can be used to track individuals .
Some may argue that it is beneficial to us as it renders us a sense of protection if our locations are known .
In fact , usage of RFID on individuals causes more harm than good as it not only intrudes our privacy (Channel 3000 , n .d .) , our security would also be compromised instead of enhanced .
As such , usage of RFID to track individuals should be banned .
Invasion of privacy has been a major concern in the use of RFID .
Some may argue that tracking ex-convicts with the use of RFID could be used to prevent criminal behavior (BBC News , 2006) .
However , we must not overlook the fact that they are still humans and basic human rights such as privacy should not be disregarded .
Similarly , individual's privacy such as 'habits and movements' should also be kept unknown to the government (Channel 3000 , n .d .) .
To sum it up , no party or organization should have the rights to such profiling/tracking with or without any purpose as it is clearly an intrusion of privacy .
Usage of RFID is useless from the security standpoint (Ou , 2007) .
As such data is being transmitted by radio waves (Bhaskar , n .d .) , it can be easily picked up by a third party who could use it for their own purpose .
This would in turn lead to invasion of privacy as the victim's location is now known .
In worse cases , such information could be used for unlawful activities , such as house breaking .
Arguments put forth that the RFID tags on individuals could be programmed in such a way to minimize information leakage .
However , the cost inflicted would be very high (Ou , 2007) .
Data generated from RFID tags of individuals could also be abused by the intended receivers such as surveillance officers (BBC News , 2006) , adding on a whole new level of security blight .
Although a complete ban on RFID is impossible , its usage on individual tracking should be banned as it intrudes our privacy and compromises our security .

"The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the result of such testing ."
Genetic testing is a medical test which can determine if an individual is potentially at risk of inheriting certain genetic diseases or if a child would be born with genetic condition .
[i] The controversy was brought up when deciding if individual have the final say to reveal such testing as genetic discrimination might surface when the results of such testing is made known to third party .
Moreover , the reliability and accuracy of the tests remain ambiguous .
Hence , the individual should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
First and foremost , genetic discrimination arises when employers lower the chance of promoting genetically-ill individuals or when these individuals are denied a job .
Likewise , these individuals may be required to pay more when they apply for a health insurance .
Since genetic testing is beneficial , some governments have come up with legal procedures that would protect suffers from genetic discrimination .
However , these laws were usually limited[ii] .
"Discrimination is probably going to increase because current laws are ineffective ."
(Gruber J , 2000) .
[iii] In addition , the accountability of such results is questionable considering that the result is often interpreted or analyzed .
According to Kathy L . Hudson (2006) "nothing has happened for the past 6 years , leaving a system in place that still does not routinely evaluate the competence of genetic testing labs" .
Similarly , since the disease might not manifest itself even if one is tested positive , no one should have the right to reveal the results as it is difficult to verify the exactitude of the result .
In conclusion , consequences such as the existence of genetic discrimination should be taken into consideration when deciding whether the tester has the right to reveal his results .
However , since the results of such testing are not completely reliable , the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether the results should be revealed .

In recent years , surveillance technology is getting more and more popular ,especially Radio-Frequency Identification(RFID) .
RFID is a kind of surveillance technology which uses tags and readers to gather information about items attaching with the tags .
While surveillance technology has contributed a lot to the society , it causes troubles such as privacy and security issues(Anonymous 2007) .
Thus proper rules and regulations are needed for surveillance technology , i .e .the use of surveillance technology should be banned in a certain degree .
Privacy issue is the one that most people are concerning about .
RFID tags can simply be used as "spy chips" since the information in the tags can be read off in a distance and then people may "watch "on you without your permission or even awareness .
(Anonymous 2007)Moreover , it is very difficult to get rid of RFID tag as these chips are too thin and tiny to be found and disabled(Surinder MB 2008) .
Thus  , formal regulations about surveillance technology should be carried out and when privacy is affected , the use of such technology should be banned in such cases .
Another problem caused by surveillance technology is the security issue .
Whenever data is collected , the idea of data ownership would go along with it(Surinder MB 2008) .
The problem about surveillance technology is that it is very difficult to control who owns the information .
For example , the unique RFID tag number on an purchased item can be linked to the credit card number used to pay for it(Surinder MB 2008) .
Salesmen may make use of the information to sieve out potential customers and robbers may find out targets from it .
Hence , if the information is open to everyone , our safety in daily lives are not ensured anymore .
However , people may argue that surveillance technology is introduced to help ensure security , and it indeed works very well in preventing crimes to occur and providing information for investigation .
We cannot deny that surveillance technology is effective and convenient , but if data ownership is not controlled , surveillance technology may become a threat to our safety .
Thus , the usage of surveillance technology should be banned when it is used in an abusive way .
In conclusion  ,surveillance technology should be banned for certain degree to ensure that privacy is protected and the security issue is solved also .
The Individual Requesting Genetic Testing Should Have the Final Say in whether to Reveal the Results of Such Testing
As an emerging technology , genetic testing is getting more and more related to people's life as being applied to predictions and diagnoses of diseases .
Since it could indicate the onset of diseases in the future , the results of genetic testing may tag a person with "having inherited defects" (Buchanan , n .d .) .Therefore , it aroused a controversy over that whether the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results .
In my opinion , the right of an individual to decide whether to reveal the results should be protected .
First and foremost , the results of genetic testing belong to medical privacy , which is one of the basic human rights .
An individual is endowed with the right to keep the sensitive medical record .
Additionally , genetic testing is not a mature technique at present and the interpretation of such results is very complicated and variable (Rennie , 1994) .
To some extent , it is irresponsible to reveal the results which are inaccurate or even false .
Moreover , once the results are forced to be revealed , consequences may be significant .
The first one is about emotional impacts .
Genetic testing creates tension within a family because it conveys people the information of getting ill also implies other family members the possibility of having the same defect genes(Kahn ,2000) .
People may feel anxious , depressed , and even guilty of revealing the results .
Gradually , people's life may be destroyed by psychological and mental problems .
The second consequence is about the genetic discrimination , especially in employment and insurance (Norrgard , 2008) .Insurance may not be provided to an individual with results showing the possibility of getting ill .
Besides , it is disadvantageous for getting a job with results showing that the individual is genetically inferior .
In that sense , revealing genetic results may put much more stress on people .
In conclusion , the results of genetic testing do have big impacts of people's life in terms of emotional impacts and genetic discrimination .
However , all the anxiety and pressure may be unnecessary because of the unreliability of such technology .
Therefore , the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results  , and this is also in agreement of protecting human rights .
Genetic testing is a kind of genetic test which determines the vulnerabilities of an individual to inherit genetic disorders (U .S National Library of Medicine , 2009 , para .
1) .
The results obtained from a genetic test can exclude an alleged genetic condition or help verify if a person is a carrier of the genetic disease or have a chance to develop the genetic disorder in future (U .S National Library of Medicine , 2009 , para .
1) .
Upon testing , the individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing (Norrgard , 2008 , Reproductive and Other Familial Concerns , para .
2) .
Family members of the individual requesting genetic testing should also have the rights to know about the results of such testing .
This is because that they might have a higher risk for developing this genetic disease or are already a carrier of this mutation .
Only by recognizing this possibility earlier , they can then make informed choices about their family planning decisions , career and other life choices (Norrgard , 2008 , Genetic Testing is a Matter of Individual Choice , para .
1) .
The use of in vitro fertilization (IVF) method can be used for family planning .
By using this method , only embryos which are free from any genetic disorders are transferred back to women's uterus and allowed to develop to full birth (Norrgard , 2008 , Family Planning , para .
2) .
Alternatively , they can choose chorionic villus sampling (CVS) , a form of genetic prenatal testing (Norrgard , 2008 , Family Planning , para .
2) .
If the foetus had been diagnosed with the mutation , the couple can then choose to terminate the pregnancy (Norrgard , 2008 , Family Planning , para .

With advances in technology , many genetic diseases which were once considered untreatable might be cured in the near future (Allen , 2006 , Future samples , para .
7) .
It is therefore important to provide close relatives who might be at risk a chance to test whether they are affected by the genetic disease .
This will help them determine their course of treatment or at least make precautions (Allen , 2006 , Future samples , para .
7) .
Furthermore , it is also unfair to the insurance companies if the individual with genetic disease decided to buy life insurance policies without revealing that they have such genetic disorder .
The insurance companies need to be cost effective too .
They should therefore have the rights to request for a medical record (Hsien , 2007 , The question: Should genetic information be disclosed to insurers ? , para .
2) .
In conclusion , the individual requesting genetic testing has the obligation to inform others of his condition (Norrgard , 2008 , Reproductive and Other Familial Concerns , para .
2) .

"The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned ."
Surveillance technology has indeed come a long way since its humble beginnings , evolving from security cameras to sophisticated methods such as Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) and the Global Position System (GPS) .
Advances in this field have allowed us to monitor the activities of people more thoroughly .
It allows for more effective tracing of an individual through an instant identification approach .
Detractors of such systems lament that such act comes at the cost of intrusion into one's privacy .
However , using surveillance technology to track people plays a vital role in addressing criminal issues and can benefit the healthcare sector .
The colossal impact it has on the society is as such a reasonable trade off and thus it should not be banned .
The most important aspect of surveillance technology is that of crime fighting , which in turn results in crime prevention .
Security cameras and closed circuit televisions (CCTV) are being installed everywhere , from homes to offices , shopping malls and even in schools .
These gadgets act as a deterrent to crimes for it captures the illegal acts on tape , and forces a potential criminal to think twice before committing felony .
It too plays a role in solving crimes , often acting as evidence to convict a suspect .
The development of biometrics surveillance has also been touted as the future of crime fighting (BAPCO Journal , 2007) .
Criminal suspects can be easily identified through the matching of physical characteristics such as facial features and fingerprints to a biometric database .
It will hence assist in investigations and empower the capabilities of the police department to detain the offenders .
Surveillance technology also plays an important role in the healthcare industry .
They serve as an essential support in patient care through the monitoring of their well-being .
Hospitals have capitalized on the potential of RFID and have since reaped the benefits .
The patients are issued wrist tags which can be traced to the hand-held communication device of the staff .
This ensures that their movement and behaviour can be consistently monitored .
The tracking of patients is particularly useful in the protection of infant babies , alzcheimer's patients and others with special vulnerabilities (Dr . Counse , n .d .) It alerts the staff should the patient encounter a mishap or wanders away .
The RFID wrist tags also codes for information regarding the patient .
Important data such as the appropriate medication , meal requirements can be easily retrieved , thereby facilitating the job of the nurses .
This method of monitoring minimizes any potential error and enhances efficiency .
It caters increased attention and care for the welfare of the patients .
In conclusion , the use of surveillance technology to track people should not be banned for it is crucial in crime fighting .
It also acts as a useful tool to ensure the patients in hospitals are well-taken care of .
RFID may revolutionize our society in future but at the very moment , it is still in its infant stage where its benefits have yet to warrant a widespread implementation while its disadvantages are surmountable .
Henceforth , the use of RFID should be limited as of now .
Firstly , RFID is redundant as its very purpose of providing security is rendered useless due to the fact that it is relatively easy to copy information broadcasted by the tags (Ou , 2007) .
For example , to gain access to a house protected by RFID , one would only need a scanner and be within range of the owner's tag to copy all the information required for access since the RFID scanner cannot differentiate between the duplicated information and the original form .
As such , RFID poses little deterrence to unwanted guests .
Secondly , RFID infringes one's privacy in the process of tracking the various information associated with that person (Ahson , 2007a) .
For instance , a salesperson can know the preferences of one's shopping habits by scanning the person's purchase records .
In doing so , he can provide better recommendations .
However , be it for enhancement of sales or not , strangers should not be allowed to harness such private information as one's privacy is of paramount importance .
Lastly , it is not effective to introduce RFID to the goods market (Ahson , 2007b) .
A typical RFID tag cost approximately 20 cents while a scanner will cost about a $1000 .
When these devices are used on items that have prices ranging a few dollars , it makes one wonder whether one is paying for the item or for the delivery process .
Furthermore , the lack of standardization of RFID means that different RFID systems require different RFID devices (Ahson , 2007b) .
Store owners importing different goods would thus need different devices and this situation is unwanted .
In conclusion , the use of RFID should be restricted as the negative impacts associated with it are appalling .
Topic: The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing
Genetic testing is a DNA-based test which involves direct examination of the DNA molecule .
Such testing can be used for carrier screening or symptomatic/presymptomatic testing .
The practice of genetic testing has raised many controversies on ethical and social issues .
Some people suggest that the results of gene tests should be revealed .
However , the individual requesting such testing should have the final say in whether to disclose the results of the testing .
There are four reasons on why the decision to disclose the results must lie on the individual requesting it .
Firstly , all results of genetic testing have some margin of errors (Rennie 1994) .
Therefore , the results should be kept confidential to prevent misuse and other potential drawbacks .
Secondly , "one has the right to own property alone as well as in association with others , and no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property" (Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948 , Article 17) .
In this case , the property concerned is the privacy of the medical results , meaning that the individual's medical confidentiality is protected by Human Rights .
Thirdly , the revealing of the genetic testing results may create tension among a family .
Because genes are shared by members of the family , all of them have a fifty percent chance of carrying the same gene as one of them (Rennie 1994) .
In other words , the results can also reveal information about other family members .
Consequently , feeling of depression and guilt may arise among the family .
Lastly , a person with known genetic results may experience 'genetic discrimination' .
For example , an individual with genetic disorders may have difficulty in obtaining insurance and/or employment (Norrgard 2008) .
Some may argue that at-risk relatives should be informed about their susceptibility to genetic diseases , so that they can take early precaution or appropriate treatment to the diseases .
However , most genetic diseases have no means of prevention or treatment (Norrgard 2008) .
Hence , in most cases , disclosing the results of genetic testing to relatives will only bring psychological and mental stress upon them .
In conclusion , for the reason of privacy and technical unreliability as well as to avoid unwanted conditions such as 'genetic discrimination' , the choice to take a genetic testing is an individual's personal matter and the decision on whether to disclose the results or not depends solely on the individual .
Recent years have witnessed the significant growth of surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) .
Along with this growth , many arguments have arisen surrounding the use of RFID on tracking people .
Many people suggest that the use of surveillance technology (RFID) to track people should be banned , while others believe that it should not .
In my view , surveillance technology such as RFID should not be banned because of its positive effects .
Surveillance technology has brought us many applications varying in many areas of our life .
First of all , RFID has played an important role in preventing criminal .
From security view , RFID can provide more precise and complete information on suspects or criminals , which results in the reduction in time and manpower for an investigation .
In other words , when combined with the "intelligent video security system using image process" technology which can "detect unexpected movement or unusual behavior that can pose a threat to people , property and infrastructure" , RFID will prevent many potential risk from criminal or dire threat like terrorism (Focus Group Meeting on Technology Convergence , 2008) .
Not only when combined with such intelligent video technology , RFID can also protect the Homeland security of a country from many threats when it functions separately .
When travelers cross a border of a country , if they obtained "an RFID-enabled border crossing document" , the Border Protection Office or Immigration Office can collect identification and citizenship information of travelers then rapidly determine if they are threats to the country or not , based on the world-wide security information system between many Governments (Use of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Technology for Border Crossings , 2008) .
Another key application from RFID is that RFID helps to improve the healthcare sector .
The wristband with embedded transponder which can be seen in many hospital all over the world is designed basically based on RFID technology .
The wristband allows specific computers or devices to track and identify the holder which can be patients or doctors of the hospital .
Thus , it can warn the management system of the hospital if unauthorized person tries to break into a restricted area or a patient tries to leave the medical condition (RFID in hospitals , retrieved from the Internet) .
For instance , it is more safe now for patients who have mental lost or mental diseases if they are lost , because they are being tracked all the time in the hospital under the surveillance system like RFID .
It is obvious that RFID technology plays a crucial role in improving the healthcare system .

However , others argue that RFID technology have infringed privacy rights of human being .
They claim that information from RFID devices can be approached by a third party and RFID can be used to track individuals illegal if the technology is well-known (Postnote from Parliamentary Office of Science and technology , 2004) .
All such concerns have been already discussed and solved by prudent policies .
Restricted uses and laws has been applied to RFID technology , hence , the information of individuals can only be seen by authorized person legally with positive purpose .
And the fact is that most of people will choose safety and security between security and privacy .
"Ross Anderson , a professor at Cambridge University in Britain , has compared the present situation to a "boiled frog" -- which fails to jump out of the saucepan as the water gradually heats .
If liberty is progressively eroded slowly , people will get used to it" (Focus Group Meeting on Technology Convergence , 2008) .
To conclude , it is indisputable that the advantages of surveillance technology outweigh the negative effect .
In conclusion , surveillance technology such as RFID should not be banned because it not only improve security system for people and country but also enhance the healthcare sector .

Nowadays , genetic testing can provide someone with information regarding his or her genetic condition .
However , ethical issues regarding the genetic testing arise among people .
Since genetic disease is hereditary and can be traced back to the ancestor , many people may inherit the disease .
Therefore , the patient requesting the test should not be the one to decide whether to reveal the result or not .
Some argue that the result is confidential since everyone's genetic information is different (Glenn , 2008) .
However , as argued before , everybody genes may be linked to their relatives' genes , so it is possible for the relatives particularly their sibling to inherit the same defective gene .
Once the disease is confirmed , then their siblings should probably take a genetic test too .
Others reason for instance in medical insurance case that it is unfair to charge individual with genetic defects at a higher rate since the defects are not what they want (Norrgard , 2008) .
But again , if they are charged at the same rate with normal people then they are being unfair to others and the insurance company since the treatment fee for such kind of genetic disease is high .
To conclude , individual requesting for genetic testing should not have the final say as it is unfair to the medical insurance company and the person's relative who may be at also at risk of inheriting the same genetic defects .
*Spinal Muscular Atrophy **In Vitro Fertilization
Since the attack on the London Underground on July 2005 , surveillance technology has generated a lot of attention after they were used to track the movements of the terrorists responsible for the attack .
Reports and articles have shown that the use of surveillance technology to track people can be beneficial to us , particularly in the healthcare and crime prevention sector and enhancing the security area .
Therefore , I fully agree that surveillance technology should not be banned .
Firstly , surveillance technology such as radio identification technology (RFID) can be used to track patients in the hospital where it will notify the nurse or hospital staffs if a patient begins to collapse .
({http://news .cnet .com/Human-chips-more-than-skin-deep/2009-1008_3-5318076 .html}[HYPERLINK: http://news .cnet .com/Human-chips-more-than-skin-deep/2009-1008_3-5318076 .html]) This way , the chances of reviving and saving a patient is greater .
If a patient suddenly collapsed in her room and there is no one to alert the nurse , it will probably take one or more hour for her to be saved when the nurse go around to check on the patients .
By that time , her life would be in danger and this would most probably bring about dire consequences such as death .
Not only that , RFID strap can also be used to monitor patients with Alzheimer's disease .
({http://news .cnet .com/Human-chips-more-than-skin-deep/2009-1008_3-5318076 .html}[HYPERLINK: http://news .cnet .com/Human-chips-more-than-skin-deep/2009-1008_3-5318076 .html])
Secondly , the implementation of radio identification technology in prison can also help to track prisoners and reduce violence in the prisons .
({http://www .rfidjournal .com/article/view/1601/1/1}[HYPERLINK: http://www .rfidjournal .com/article/view/1601/1/1]) .
Prison officers will be able to monitor the movement and exact locations of the inmates and thus this will deter them from committing crimes in the prison .
Not only that , if indeed that a crime happened , the prison guards will be able to investigate and know who is the culprit .
Furthermore , it can also ensure that the inmates do not escape by sending alerts when an inmate approaches the jail perimeter .
Thirdly , surveillance technology can also be use to keep track of our children and prevent kidnapping .
( HYPERLINK "http://technu .nst .com .my/Current_News/techNu/Monday/Notebook/20080211123356/Article/index_html" http://technu .nst .com .my/Current_News/techNu/Monday/Notebook/20080211123356/Article/index_html) .
Parents can strap radio identification technology on the wrist of their children in order to monitor the location of their children .
For example , when the child is missing or kidnapped , the parents will be able to know the exact location of their kids .
This can also help the police in their investigative work .
In conclusion , surveillance technology should not be banned to track people as it not only can save life but also improves the healthcare sector while enhancing the security of our society .
The controversy over whether or not the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in revealing the result of such testing has been present for a long period of time .
Genetic testing refers to the reading of the human genome to identify if one is subjected to genetically linked diseases , such as Alzheimer's disease .
The main issue pertaining to this is that when an individual choose not to disclose the result of the genetic testing , it is actually unfair to and has adverse impacts on both his family and employer .
The result of the genetic testing concerns parties other than the individual alone , and therefore , the individual requesting for genetic testing should not have the final say to whether the results should be revealed to others .
Firstly , often , when an individual is tested to be positive for genetic disorder , he will be reluctant to share the result with others , even the closest kin .
This is unjust to the family members as it meant that they have also , the possibility of suffering from genetic disorder .
They should thus be notified so that they will be able to do necessary family planning , especially in the case if the individual carries a mutation that may result in fatal genetic disorder ({http://www .nature .com}[HYPERLINK: http://www .nature .com] , 2008) .
The importance of sharing the information with family members is recognized , as even during the pretest genetic counseling session , an individual will be advised to share the result with them ({www .ons .org}[HYPERLINK: http://www .ons .org] , 2009) .
Due to the negative consequences of allowing individual to make the decision , individual should therefore not be given the right to have the final say about revealing the result .
Secondly , given choice of not revealing the result of genetic testing , individual will therefore and most of the time chooses to do so to his related company .
This action has an adverse impact on the company .
If during the course of employment , the individual's welfare and safety were being threatened by the work that he was doing , the company will be held liable , despite being ignorant about the dangers that that he were vulnerable to ({http://www .law .duke .edu}[HYPERLINK: http://www .law .duke .edu] , 2002) .
Furthermore , when individual develops into the genetically linked disease , efficiency of work will be reduced , but yet the company will incur additional expenses to cover the issues that arose from a sick worker ({http://www .law .duke .edu}[HYPERLINK: http://www .law .duke .edu] , 2002) .
This furthermore supports that the individual requesting for genetic testing should not have the final say in revealing the result of such testing .
In conclusion , due to the negative consequences on both the family and the related company , individual should not the power of decision-making in whether or not to reveal the result of the genetic testing .
Genetic testing is used to test for genetic disorders , such as Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease .
With the test , people are able to understand the conditions of the diseases which they inherited genes from their parents .
It helps to improve people's lives .
While helping the people , there is also an ethical dilemma and social issues arose with it .
Facing these problems , people who have done the test should have the right to keep the result from others .
One reason for revealing the result to the family members is that the result is not only applicable to the individual but also to other family members , as they may also have inherited the diseases .
Even though the individual may have the responsibility to inform the others about the possibility of them inheriting the genes , one should have the right to decide whether to tell .
The result will give individual the psychological distress and harm , which will actually affect or worsen one's health (U .S . National Institutes of Health) .
When people find out about the test , knowing them might have the genes , the stress level will increases in turn their health will be affected .
Moreover , the test result may be faulty and some people carrying the gene may never develop the disease .
Revealing will cause a burden to them .
Individuals who have done the test may face discrimination (Karen Norrgard , 2008) .
The result may be used against the person .
Insurance company may use the information to raise rates or to deny the insurance .
Employers may not hire or promote them .
Family and friends may treat them differently or even abandon them .
One has to face these consequences even if the possibility of developing the disease is low .
Furthermore , the testing only gives the percentage but not the definitive results .
In making the test known to others , one has to face others' judgements throughout the life .
In conclusion , people should have the right in restricting others from knowing the result of the test as psychological and social issues impose great impacts on people's lives .
Radio frequency identification (RFID) is an example of the surveillance technology used commonly for identification and tracking purposes .
The market for such device is growing very quickly due to its affordable price and widespread use (Sieberg D , 2006) .
However , there are also several problems attributed from the use of RFID .
Most concerns revolve around the fact that RFID invades one's privacy and violates human rights when they are used for tracking people .
Thus , the use of RFID to track people should be banned .
RFID can be used to track individuals as information can be easily retrieved from the RFID tags without their consent .
It becomes impossible to know or detect the presence of a RFID tag since it can be read from a distance away from the individual (DiLorenzo , 2008) .
Furthermore , it is hard to decide who should have the access to such information (Sieberg D , 2006) .
Companies which specialise in RFID tags may pass the information obtained from the RFID tags to any buyer if government does not intervene or control .
In some cases , people are forced to have RFID tags implanted in their body for tracking purposes .
This may lead to even more implications on the welfare of the victims and therefore we should not use such technology to track people .
It is argued that RFID can be beneficial for patients in medical monitoring such as daily temperature taking (Paddock C , 2007) .
However , the use of RFID can have undesirable effects on our body because radio waves from RFID are mutagenic and it is harmful when exposed in large quantity .
Such radio waves can also cause cancer (Paddock C , 2007) .
Therefore , the use of surveillance technology such as RFID should be banned .
In conclusion , we should prohibit the use of RFID tags on individual without consent as they violate location privacy and affects our health .
Therefore , the use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned as it threatens the welfare of individuals .
A lot of surveillance technologies has been invented and developed .
One of them is RFID(Radio Frequency Identification) which has been used widely thorough the world even used to track people .
Yet there are many debates on this tracking concerning the ethical and moral issues .
Some argue that RFID tracking has bad effects in human life but in reality the tracking gives many advantages for human .
Therefore , due to the advantages , the use of RFID in tracking people should not be banned .
Opponents of people tracking using RFID say that the tracking weighs the important privacy of the people tracked and abuses personal information by some unauthorised man (Tan & Li , 2008) .
However , the using of RFID to track is initially according to the agreement of the patients and workers .
In addition , the RFID nowadays have been made with high security to ensure the confidential of the tracked person (Tan & Li , 2008) .
It is also said that the implanting of RFID in human body may cause electromagnetic disturbance in the body (Roberti , 2007) .
However , this effect has not been proved and so far there is no any issue regarding this disturbance .
In conclusion , RFID tracking should not be banned as it does not inflict the privacy of people and gives advantages in many aspects in human life .
Genetic testing is a development in science that allows early detection of genetic diseases (Anonymous , 2005) .
There is often a concern whether the individual should reveal their genetic result as it may bring about several impacts to the individual and to the third party .
Therefore , the individual should bear in mind the consequences and decide whether to reveal their genetic results .
Revealing of genetic test results may pose impacts on the individual as well as the family members .
Firstly , revealing of genetic test may cause the individual to be genetically discriminated (Norrgard , 2008) .
This is due to the fact that genetic testing can reveal possible high-risk diseases the individual may develop .
As such , it has been known that many insurance companies tend to deny individuals essential health care based on their genetic disposition (Anonymous , 2005) .
Secondly , it may create psychological distress to family members if the genetic test results were to be revealed .
As genetic diseases can be inherited among family members , anxiety and fear of inheriting the genetic diseases that the individual has been diagnosed will be created .
Therefore , the individual should have the final say in disclosing their genetic results as it may bring about several impacts .
However , some may argue that revealing of genetic test results of an individual would be able to protect other family members .
Indeed , early knowledge of the risk to genetic diseases might help family members to take preventive measures to reduce the onset of such diseases .
However , one should not forget that once the genetic result of the individual is disclosed , it might be difficult for the individual to integrate into the society as they may be discriminated .
There will be benefits to other parties but adverse implication towards the individual .
Therefore , the individual requesting for genetic test should have the final say in whether to reveal their test results .
In conclusion , revealing of test results may bring about several impacts to the individual as well as the third party .
Hence , the individual should bear in mind the impacts that may arise and decide if they should reveal such results .
Genetic testing is a method that diagnoses an individual's diseases based on their genes through biochemical measurement .
Since it has been brought , it received critics as much as compliments because of the risk of assaulting the individual's parity .
There are many controversies about whether the individuals have rights to disclose their results .
I am inclined to the rights of individuals to reveal their genetic outcome .
Publicizing an individual's result can bring about big impacts on them , due to the discrimination in families , career choosing , health insurance and society hierarchy .
The individual should have rights to decide whether to disclose his results to other .
Genetic testing predicts an individual's inherent risks for the disease and genetic disorders .
Depending on the seriousness of the disease , the individual decides whether to reveal his diagnosis .
Sometimes , if his families and relatives know about his result , they may start to change their behaviour towards the individual .
This may worsen the situation .
Since moral supports are indispensable for one's going , it will evidently cause depression in the individual and exacerbate the individual's chance of disease .
There is also another noticeable problem that the individual might even not want to be worried by his whole family .
Insurance companies will utilize the results to overcharge people .
Some African American workers , in the early 1970s , taking as an example , have the genetic mutation associated with sickle-cell anemia , were denied insurance coverage or charged higher premiums (Andrews , 1987) .
Similarly , in 2002 , the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company had to pay up to $2 .2 million to employees who were secretly tested for a genetic variation for a disorder (Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company , 2002) .
(Karen Norrgard , 2008) .
Moreover , forcing the individual to publicize his result will bring about a new caste system where people are grouped according to the genome .
This group of people will have rights denied from them as they belong to the lower class people .
Is not it another more sophisticated kind of discrimination ?
In conclusion , due to the serious impact in one's life , we should let the individual to decide his revealing genetic results .
Genetic testing has been widely used in the society of modern times .
It allows one to know if he has a genetic disorder by doing the test .
This seems like a good idea but whether to reveal the testing result is a controversy .
Some may feel that revealing the results may be viewed as invading privacy , while in fact; not revealing the results can be seen as being irresponsible .
There are family members , friends and employers who are playing a part in his life .
Thus , due to the implications of many other people , the individual should not have the final say .
An individual who wish to start a family with his spouse should reveal the testing result .
Marriage and having children are not just between the couple , it involves the two families .
Some people are carriers of genetic disorders , they have the genes even if they do not show the disease themselves (Genetic Testing n .d .) .
The unborn child may have the chance to get the disorder from his parents .
It is the responsibility of the individuals to tell their family members the likely outcome of the unborn child .
Therefore , individuals intending to have children need to reveal their testing result .
Some who argue that revealing the test result will attract discrimination such as being viewed as an outcast of the society .
They may be denied insurance due to their disorder .
However , revealing the result can be seen as a form of education to the employers .
They can make sure that their workers with genetic disorders are not being exposed to any environment that may agitate their illnesses (Andre , C . , & Velasquez , M . n .d .) .
Employers have the responsibility to provide a safe working environment for their workers (Andre , C . , & Velasquez , M . n .d .) .
Therefore , this can only be done if individuals reveal their testing result .
In conclusion , individuals should not have the final say as any disorders that they may be found out will affect their family and also the result will allow their employer to provide them a safe working environment .
Advances in genetic testing allow one to detect the presence of abnormal gene which could cause genetic disorder .
This has brought about many debates on whether the individual who undergo genetic testing should have the final say in revealing the results .
While some proponents suggest that it is the privacy of the individual who undergoes the genetic testing , but the test results might also have adverse effects to those who are closely related to that person .
Hence , the individual undergoing the genetic testing should not have the final say in revealing the results .
Firstly , for an individual with positive genetic test results , he has no right in keeping the test results to himself .
He needs to inform his wife in order to make wise decision if they were to start a family (When Do Doctors Recommend Genetic Testing ? , n .d .) .
They need to discuss on whether by not giving birth the disorder can be prevented from being passed on to the next generation .
Alternatively , they can test and abort the fetus affected with the genetic disease .
Hence , this affects not only the person with genetic disease , but also the life partner .
Many critics claimed that individual with positive genetic test result should have the right not to reveal the test results to potential employers .
They argued that the job applicants should not be discriminated just because of the positive genetic test result (Andre and Velasquez , n .d .) .
However , with the knowledge of employees' genetic disorders , employers can better reduce the occurrence of work-related diseases .
Employers can use the information acquired from genetic testing to ensure that their employees are not exposed to environmental agents that might caused them to have increase risk in genetic disorders .
This can ultimately lead to the reduction of work-days loss .
In conclusion , the individual requesting for genetic test should not have the final say in disclosing the test result as it affects not only one person but also the family and employers .
First and foremost , He have to tell his prospective spouse or fiancee about his genetic testing result because; some people who have abnormal gene inherited by their parent won't have observable symptoms of a the disease but will have a 50:50 chance of inheriting the disease to their children (Genetic Testing , 2007) .
By telling to the spouse priorly , they can take preventive medic treatment before planning to have children .
The second reason is an obligation to tell his employer about his diseases .
Some people may argue that it is unfair to use of genetic tests in recruitment of employees or job applicants because it is treating people discriminatively based on fixed characteristic (Andre , Velasquez , n .d .) .
The main purpose of employment genetic screening which is to make sure that the prospective job is safe and not causing complication or any bad effect for those having this kind of diseases .
Hence , genetic testing for job screening purpose isn't violating employees' right .
Last but not least is regarding the sake of other people around him .
Those who have this disease perceived a strong sense of responsibility to share this information with others (Loescher , Crist , Siaki , 2009) .
To sum up , anyone who is suffering from genetic diseases or carrier of this diseases should not has a final say in whether to reveal or to hide about his disease .
Instead , it is a must for him to disclose his disease to: his spouse to save their baby from inheriting the disease , his employer to make sure that his job is safe and all people around him .
Revealing the Genetic testing result will be beneficiary for himself , his employer , his family and all the people around him .
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is an automatic identification system that is used to identify people and items by the transmission of radio waves (DiLorenzo , 2008) .
The use of RFID to track people has invaded privacy and caused a breach to security .
In addition , human implantation of RFID may bring about health and medical problems .
Therefore , the use of RFID to track people should be banned as it would bring about negative impacts to the society .
There are two main reasons why using RFID to track people should be banned .
Firstly , it will cause impingement to privacy and security .
The use of RFID to track people enables law enforcement agencies to know our every move: our location , what we have bought and other information about our lives .
These private information may also be accessed by other parties as the RFID can be decoded and may be subjected to viral threats (DiLorenzo , 2008) .
Criminals may have access to these information and this may put our life in danger as these criminals can easily harm us once they know our exact location .
Secondly , human implantation of RFID to track people may pose health problems .
Animal studies on these RFID microchips suggested that RFID implantation in human may result in cancer (Paddock , 2007) .
In addition , the implanted chip in the skin may move to other parts of the body .
This will cause difficulty in removing the chip and this may lead to other more serious health problems .
Proponents of using RFID to track people argued that such usage of RFID is important in the medical field as it helps to monitor patient's health and enables the immediate retrieval of patient's information (Paddock , 2007) .
However , there is no guarantee that the RFID tag would be protected from security breaches .
As such , patient's medical information may leak out , which in turn may result in social discrimination and loss of health care coverage .
Medical information stored in the RFID may also be altered by hackers and this would lead to error in diagnosis (Sieberg , 2006) .
In conclusion , the use of RFID to track people should be banned as it will cause invasion in privacy , security breaches as well as health problems when RFID chips are implanted .
In recent years , the advancements of 'Radio Frequency Identification' (RFID) have led to its increased use in many major organisations .
One of the uses of RFID has been to track people .
However , critics have been quick to point out that it is an intrusion of privacy and are calling for it to be banned .
I believe that the benefits of RFID used in tracking people far outweigh the 'uncertain' disadvantages and thus it should not be banned .
Firstly , RFID has been seen as a solution to track medical patients .
As mentioned by the "American Medical Association" (Roberti 2007) , RFID allows quick and accurate identification and access to patients' data in times of emergency .
This is to ensure "improved continuity and coordination of care" (Roberti 2007) and reduce the probabilities in "adverse drug events and other medical errors" (Roberti 2007) .
Secondly , the use of RFID has been adopted in oil companies such as "Stratos" (Mehdizadeh 2007) to track and ensure workers' safety .
With the integration of both RFID and Global Positioning System (GPS) , it is used to locate workers' during emergencies .
RFID can also authenticate if the worker has the right to access certain areas and use certain machineries .
Critics though have been quick to identify that the "unauthorised reading and changing of RFID data" (Tan and Li 2008) as an encroachment of privacy .
However , there have been measures being put in place such as the usage of "Authentication" (Tan and Li 2008) to identify the reader .
This prevents "counterfeiting behaviours" and to "control access to label contents" (Tan and Li 2008) .
Distracters have also argued that "RFID may cause electromagnetic interference" (Roberti 2007) , exposing the user to the dangers of magnetic interference .
So far , there has not been a formal report confirming that worry .
In conclusion , I believe that the usage of RFID in tracking human should not be banned as the advantages of its usage outweigh its disadvantages .
And I have absolute trust in scientists to iron out the flaws to make RFID truly the "perfect" solution to many existing limited technology .
Genetic testing is used to examine the genes of a patient or a latent patient , in order to analysis the causes of some diseases .
It is now widespread and ranging from testing the congenital defect of a foetus to finding the existence of the oncogene .
However , with the application of genetic testing , some problems are revealed gradually , such as whether the patients should tell their families about their testing results .
In fact , everyone has to be responsible for the health of their families and themselves , hence , the individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the testing results , and these results should be made known to their relatives .
Firstly , it is immoral for a person to conceal his genetic testing results .
These results will not only affect this person but also affect his families .
It means that when a person tests positive for a gene mutation , his relatives may also have this mutation since they all have similar genes .
If the person does not tell his families about the test results , his families would not know their health deficiencies and would not tell their doctors .
In this case , the person's families are likely suffering from such diseases and missing the earlier diagnosis in the future , which are mainly caused by the person's concealment of his testing results .
Secondly , such concealment will become a source of dispute in marriage .
For example , if a man's genetic testing results indicated some pathogenic genes but he got married with a woman without telling her about these results , the woman might feel that she has been cheated after she knew the truth because she did not want to married to a man with gene deficiency .
In addition , if they already have children and their children also have such pathogenic genes through heredity , who should responsible for these children's health problems ?
In conclusion , the individual should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of genetic testing .
It is important for individuals to share the results with their families in order to avoid diseases and benefit the whole family in the future .
There are two main arguments to support my stand .
Firstly , a couple who is planning get marry and one of them or a close relative of them has an inherited disease is advised to take up genetic testing .
The result of such genetic test affects not only the individual but also affects his family and his fiance .
Both sides of family members should have the right to know the result and will be able to make preventive and treatment measures .
Furthermore , if the couple is planning to give birth but one of them having a positive result of such testing , they can discuss with their closed family members whether to have baby or not .
Thus , there is not right for the individual taking such test to keep the result as a secret .
Furthermore , in my opinion , employers have the right to know such result to ensure that their prospective or current employees are not placed in environments that might be hazardous to them and also can react immediately if something happens (Claire Andre and Manuel Velasquez , n .d .) .
If the individual has the final say to decide whether to reveal the result , it is unfair for his closed family and also people who are related to him if the individual decide to keep the result to him .
Others argued that it is unfair for the individual as the result is a kind of confidential information .
However , by not disclosing of such result , the consequences are serious .
The risk of giving birth to inherit genetic disease child is high and also endanger the individual by exposing himself to work environment that may be hazardous to his health .
In conclusion , the individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing for the sake of himself , his closed family and also his employer .
A genetic test is defined as an assessment of a person's genes to determine the probablitity of inheriting abnormalities or diseases as well as carrier status which he may pass down the generations .
Thus many will say the results must also be make known to his relatives even without his consent .
However , one should have the rights to decide for himself whether he should tell his results to a third party e .g .
relatives or corporations .
It is obvious that everyone have the rights to ensure their privacy , as these are what make us different from animals .
Thus as fellow Homo sapiens , each and every one has the rights to decide for himself .
Proponents may argue that the doctors should also release the genetic testing results to the relatives as these may also involved them .
However , it would be ridiculous that the relatives are able to know that they might also face this particular genetic disease in future from the individual's results since everyone have a unique genome unless they are twins .
And also even they are somehow blood related , the probability of them inheriting the same particular genetic disorder are different .
In conclusion , there could be some laws pass down to settle all these ethical issues .
Ultimately , it still does not solve the root of these problems and the unforeseen situations in the future .
Therefore rights should be given to the individual to decide for himself , as the decisions made will be impactful and irreversible on his life .
The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned .
The development and advances in surveillance technology such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) have made it possible to track anyone , anything , any places , anytime .
This has brought about many debates on the ethics , human rights , privacy and even health concerns surrounding the use of RFID .
Although some argue that the use of RFID to track people brings benefits , it posts great risks to exposure one's privacy to criminals , which is against the human rights and perhaps , threatens one's health .
Thus , such use of RFID to track people should be banned .
The use of RFID to track people is against human rights and violates one's privacy .
By using RFID technology , one's personal information , purchased goods and whereabouts can be tracked easily by private corporations or government (DiLorenzo 2008) .
Worse , hackers and analysts can remotely read the information from RFID which stores private information such as your credit card passwords , medical history and location (Sieberg 2006) .
Although some argue that RFID technology that stores one's information in RFID such as credit card or identity card provides great convenience , it creates chances for criminals as well at the same time .
Furthermore , tracking one's private information is against human rights .
Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that no one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy , family , home or correspondence , nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation .
Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks .
Health concerns are also related with the use of RFID to track people .
Some companies have implanted RFID microchips in their staffs to track their locations and information .
However , some studies showed that lab mice and rats sometimes developed sarcomas , or malignant tumors , after being implanted with microchips (Paddock 2007) .
Although humans are different from lab mice , there is a risk that what happened on the mice might happen on humans as well .
Furthermore , ifthe microchips react with a strong electrical or magnetic field , the implant could be destroyed and cause serious burns .
In conclusion , RFID should not be used to track people as it not only posts great risks to one's privacy and health but also violates ethics and human rights .
The use of RFID to track people should be banned by law and rules .
Genetic testing has enabled people to test for certain genetic diseases , especially those which they might be prone to and thus go for necessary treatments or make necessary arrangements .
However , it has also led to privacy and confidentiality problems whereby the results of the test have become a topic for debate .
Making known the results of genetic testing to relevant parties such as employers and even family members can cause ethical and social problems .
Thus , individuals requesting genetic testing should always have the final say on whether to reveal the test results to a third party .
The result of the test is the property of these people .
Thus , others should never be allowed to reveal or look into it without the permission of the owner .
This is to prevent others from using the information to discriminate against them .
For example , an employer might choose to not hire or to fire someone if he is to find out that the person has a certain disease such as cancer or Huntington disease (Maxwell & Mehlman , 1999) .
This might cause greater problems to the person involved especially if he is the breadwinner of the family .
Another social consequence would be when individuals are discriminated against in Health coverage based on their genetic make-up .
For example , insurance companies might increase the premiums of customers who are at risk for a certain disorder or even cancel their policy .
This discrimination would be very unfair to the individuals involved (Norrgard , 2008) .
Therefore , these individuals should always have the final say .
While it may be difficult even for the individual to accept the results of the test , sharing the news with their relatives and friends may be the larger concern .
While some may feel that it is the moral obligation of these individual to inform his immediate family members of positive results of inheritable diseases such as cancer or HD , since they too may inherit the disease , I feel that there is no need for such an action as the result is after all private and confidential .
Also , certain genetic test such as the test for disorders of sexual development is a very private matter .
If an individual is to be tested positive for this disorder , such that she has the genotype for males but has phenotype for females , she might be ostracised and suffer self-esteem problems (Borenstein , 2009) .
If these individuals have the final say on whether to share the result , they would be less stressed as they do not have to be concerned with the views of others whom they do not want to share the result with .
This would give them more time to adjust to their personal emotion .
In conclusion , the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing should always lie on the individual who has requested for the test .
With the advances in medical technology , it is now possible to identify one's genetic susceptibilities to certain diseases and disorders .
Despite the fact that genetic testing can bring about more opportunities for early discoveries of treatable disorders , there are still many controversies revolving around ethical issues on genetic testing .
Many argue that revelation of testing results may invade personal privacy and bring about discrimination .
Besides ethical implications , medical implications such as accuracy of test results are also concerns the general public hold for the issue .
Therefore , with these concerns , it is important that the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
The two main ethical concerns regarding genetic testing are privacy and discrimination .
Firstly privacy is one of the worries one will have while considering whether or not to carry out genetic testing .
The fear for disclosure of results to third parties might discourage people from participating in the testing although the test might be favourable to them .
Furthermore , health care providers might also reveal the person's genetic status to concerned family members which in turn weakened our confidence in the providers .
(Holtzman , 1996) Secondly , information from genetic testing of individuals with genetic susceptibilities is used by employers and insurance companies to deny them employment as well as to grant lower insurance coverage .
This is generally known as discrimination .
(Holtzman , 1996) With reference to a survey conducted by Georgetown University , out of 332 families with genetic susceptibilities , "22% reported they had been refused health insurance , and 13% had been fired from their jobs based on their perceived genetic risks ."
(Of Genes and Pink Slips: Genetic Testing Goes to Work , 2005) Up to date , not many laws have been passed down to protect the rights of people with higher genetic risks .
However , some would argue that such discrimination against employees is fair as an employee with genetic susceptibility to a known disease might bring about deleterious effects to the company's operations and other employees .
Alternatively , companies should allocate other job which is more suitable and does not put the employee at risk .
(Holtzman , 1996) In this way , both parties benefit and there is no unfair discrimination .
In conclusion , individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing so as to protect oneself from discrimination and invasion of privacy .

Should the individual requesting genetic testing have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing ?
Now days , genetic testing has caused ethical and moral issues .
One of them is about the privacy and confidentiality of the individual who undergo genetic testing , whether he or she should reveal the results of the testing to third parties or not .
While it is true that people's individual right should be respected , but if others can be saved by revelation of the results of the person undergo the genetic testing then it should be done .
Thus , the individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
There are several advantages by revealing the results of genetic testing to third parties .
It is also commonly known that if a person has genetic disease , there is a chance that his or her relatives would have the same disease too .
If the genetic testing is revealed to the relatives and they end up having the same disease , they could be saved by preventing the disease to develop further more .
Another thing is people's life is obviously more important than privacy , especially if it's your loved ones .
Therefore it is encouraged to reveal the result of genetic testing , especially to your relatives .
In conclusion , the individual undergo genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing as they are protected by the laws against discrimination and also because other people's life could be saved .
The rights and wrongs on using surveillance technology on the public has been an issue for a long time .
The issue of privacy was commonly used to outweigh the aspects of safety and security .
The ban of surveillance technology should not be imposed on .
By allowing proper usage of surveillance technology , one could increase the level of security and safekeeping in a country as well as improving work efficiency at a workplace .
The use of surveillance technology could increase the level of security and safekeeping of a country .
By using video surveillance technology specifically at appropriate places , it could help the government protect the public more efficiently such as preventing the crimes before it happened (Gray , 2009 , p .1) .
As reported in the news last year , West Virginia decided to use video surveillance technology on its highways to help in the finding of missing children (Stump , 2008 , p .1) which resulted in one hundred percent recovery of the missing children (Stump , 2008 , p .2) .
On another side , it can also help improve the work efficiency at a workplace , more commonly in office work settings .
In an office set-up , the atmosphere is created by separating employees into cubicles .
The cubicles allows employees to do things unrelated to work and employers are unable to push the employees to get the work done when they spend more than half the time using the facilities available for their own indulgence .
Thus by setting up an electronic surveillance to keep track of the employees' usage of facilities , the employees will become more 'aware' of their situation and start taking their job more seriously , improving work efficiency (Heathfield , n .d . , p .1) .
Though there is an issue regarding the invasion of one's privacy , this could be resolved by placing appropriate safeguards which protect the public's privacy when implementing the use of surveillance technology (Gray , 2009 , p .3) .
In conclusion , the use of surveillance technology should not be banned as it could increase the level of security and safety of a country and also enhance work efficiency .
Topic: "The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing ."
Genetic testing is a medical test , which is used to diagnose the disorder in the genome of a person and determine if this mutation can cause a specific disease .
With the development of ability to test for genetic disorder , an arising problem that has been "the subject of significant debate within the bioethics community" (Mehlman , 1999 , para .5) is the privacy of genetic information .
Generally , the consensus for this problem is that genetic information should not be disclosed against people's privacy .
To protect the welfare of patients with genetic problem , their genetic information should not be disclosed over their objection or even without their permission .
But in fact , there are some arguments that revealing this information can protect some third parties from harm , for example , enable the avoidance of inherited disorder .
Thus , there should be strict laws to ensure patients' right to decide on revealing their testing results , which means it definitely needs their permission to do so .
In conclusion , until these laws are enacted , not revealing such information without patients' consent or using other method like alias testing are the better choices .
Monitoring employees at workplace and installing video cameras at public places such as banks , stores or restaurants are one of the debatable issues today .
Whereas advocates of such surveillance technologies emphasize on the benefit as to promote work efficiency and secure communal settings , opponents strike back by stating intensified concerns related to individual privacy .
Nevertheless , the banning of surveillance technology should not be enforced , for the manifest reason that its strengths outweigh weaknesses and privacy concerns could be reduced once proper use is implemented .
To elaborate , the benefits of surveillance might be classified into two categories .
Firstly , the monitoring system at workplace indeed effectively drives employees to perform better .
Meanwhile , surveillance on lax supervisors may evidently verify their incompetence (Heathfield , n .d) .
Namely , mutual surveillance guarantees active working environments , as well as bringing high productivity and huge profits to the employers .
Secondly , as Mr . Gray , Mayor of Lancaster , states , the use of surveillance technologies plays a utilitarian role in public security and criminals detecting (Gray , 2009) .
For instance , video cameras in supermarkets can detect anyone suspicious of stealing or record the process of a burglary .
Sometimes criminals will be deterred if they are aware of the hidden surveillance .
Furthermore , the tracking of criminals using hi-tech sensors or video cameras largely shortens the chasing time of the police (Stump , 2008) .
Concerns of privacy issues might be crucial to constructing regulations on the implementation , however , the solutions are abundant thus the banning of surveillance technology is utterly unnecessary .
To illustrate , companies shall not be allowed to monitor phone calls expect for business related ones (Heathfield , n .d .) .
Simultaneously , the safeguards should be briefed on their integrity so as not to reveal any information obtained through surveillance; strict penalties should be enforced on those who fail to preserve privacy (Gray , 2009) .
The monitoring system has to be regularly assessed to prevent privacy invasion .
To sum up , surveillance technology should not be banned as its usefulness in workplace and enhancing public safety makes it an indispensable tool in today's world .
Surveillance in context is the close observation of a person or a group .
In the past , surveillance is conducted through human to human tracking .
With advances in technology , surveillance nowadays is aided by equipments such as closed-circuit TV (CCTV) , camera , voice recorder and RFID (radio frequency identification) .
This has brought about debates on ethical and moral issues with regards to the usage of surveillance technology especially RFID .
There may be arguments that surveillance technology is beneficial to humans in this modern era .
While not compromising the benefits it brings , the ethical and moral issues regarding surveillance technology far outweighs the benefits it bring .
Thus , it should be banned .
In conclusion , the disadvantages of surveillance technology outweigh the advantages .
The effectiveness is in doubt , human rights are invaded and there could be abuse of this technology .
Therefore surveillance technology should be banned .
The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
With current technological advancements in genetics , there are many genetic tests available for the public , from testing for inheritance diseases and terminal illnesses .
I believe that an individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
The individual should be given the choice as , the emotional hurt from the media release of these results , the use of results against the individual .
However , professional assistance should be available for the individual to seek advice .
Firstly , the emotional hurt from the world wide release of the individual's genetic information can overwhelming .
With the outreach of the mass media , reports of genetic disorder of an individual could be known to the world in minutes .
(Seth , 2009) This will cause humiliation , especially when he/she is a professional , like an athlete .
However , many of these genetic disorders are unidentified late , inherited and incurable .
(Seth , 2009) The Olympics have tested their female athletes over five games and found 27 out of 11373 women tested positive for hermaphrodite (Seth , 2009) .
Secondly , the unintentional use of the genetic information can be disadvantageous to the individual and undermine the individual's ability , career , social interactions and economical choices .
In the interest of the corporation , people who are tested positive for terminal illness will not be provided health insurance or the career advancement .
(Maxwell , 1999) Knowing one's death is approaching , the individual could make inappropriate social choices that can harm him/her and others .
(Norrgard , 2008)
However , if the individual is unable to make the appropriate choice of the usage of the genetic results , a professional doctor should step in to provide relevant advice , while maintain patient-doctor confidentiality .
The individual may refused to release the genetic test's result , when it could provide treatment or prevent the spread of the illness within the family , in the fear of discrimination and humiliation .
(Norrgard , 2008)
With the disastrous outing from the media release of genetic information and the use of genetic information against the individual , I believe that the individual requesting the genetic testing should have the final say in the release of the results .
But , if the choice cannot be made by the individual , a professional should provide appropriate release and use of the results .
The Individual Requesting Genetic Testing Should Not Have the Final Say in Whether to Reveal the Results
Genetic testing is the analysis of genes , chromosomes , RNA and proteins .
It is used to predict the risk of disease , identify carriers of disease , diagnose disease (Genetic Testing , 2006 , para 1) , and can also be used to determine parents of the child .
Genetic testing includes scientific methods in biology , chemistry , and sometimes even biochemical tests .
Nowadays , as the technology developing , individuals have more approach to such tests .
However , such people requesting genetic tests should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of the tests .
Secondly , when the result of a particular genetic test is beneficial to the whole society , researchers have the very right to disclose such outcome .
As we know , scientists all over the world are working together to make people life better by studying the genome of human and other organisms .
In doing such a significant project , they need numerous different genes to work on .
Sometimes discovering an insignificant phenomenon or test results and anglicizing it can really make a breakthrough .
Hence , when an individual requesting genetic testing comes up with an interesting exploration , it may change the perspective in looking into the subject , for instance , treating cancer , AIDS or some hereditary diseases .
As a result , these individuals should not have the final say in hiding their results .
In contrary , the results should be shared among scientists and researchers for the whole world's sake .
In conclusion , individuals who request genetic testing should not have final say in revealing the results or not for two major reasons: protecting their blood relatives from genetic disorders and helping the whole society for genetic researches .

Advances in technology have made surveillance technology so common nowadays .
Surveillance technology is the electronic equipment use to monitor the behavior and activities , usually of people without his permission .
Argument on the banning of the use of surveillance technology has been going on for years .
The use of surveillance technology should not be banned because it is useful in ensuring the public safety and monitoring workplace in a company .
The use of surveillance technology should not be banned because it can bring important benefits to us .
Firstly , in companies , surveillance technology is used to monitor employees at work (Heathfield , n .d . , p .1) .
Employees might seem to be surfing the web for business purposes at all time , but what they actually doing is personal business such as online banking , shopping and chatting .
If the behavior of employees at work is monitored , they will work more efficiently and contribute to the company .
Secondly , surveillance technology helps in enhancing and ensuring public security (Gray , 2009 , para .1) .
Tracking of missing or kidnapped children (Stump , 2008 , para .1) , movement of dangerous criminals and terrorists can be done using video and satellite surveillance .
The cameras have the function of identifying , detecting and recording vehicles' number , suspect's action and those illegal organizations' movement .
These help the police to solve cases especially criminal and traffic cases in the shortest time .
Arguments put forth in support of banning the use of surveillance technology are faulty .
It has been argued that one's privacy might be invaded (Heathfield , n .d . , p .2) .
However , monitoring can take place under suitable circumstances and to an appropriate extend .
It has also been said that surveillance of employees can affect the relationship between employer and employees (Heathfield , n .d . , p .2) .
However , this only applies to those minority spending most of the time online doing personal things and do not meet the company's goals .
Using of surveillance technology has no impact for those focusing on work and doing the right thing (Heathfield , n .d . , p .2) .
In conclusion , the used of surveillance technology should not be banned as it benefits a lot to us in public security and also business efficiency .
"The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing ."
Development and advancement in the field of genetic research has challenged the scientists and the public on a wide range of issues especially issue relating ethical concerns .
Although it seems that confidentiality of the test result is a personal matter , disclosure of such result would eventually benefit the community as a whole in the long run .
Therefore , result of genetic testing should be revealed without the consent of the person who requested it .
Firstly , result of genetic testing should be fully disclosed as it enables third party to get treatment or prevention before the condition worsens (Maxwell & Mehlman , 1999) .
By and large , genetic disorders can be inherited within family members as the defective gene might be passed on from one generation to another .
The decision to reveal a genetic test result such as breast cancer would help early detection and treatment .
Some may argue that disclosure of such results would cause discrimination towards the patients .
However , Science Daily (2008) notes that Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) has been approved to forbid insurance company from discriminating through reduced coverage or pricing and prohibits employer from making adverse employment decision in order to encourage more people to undergo genetic test which could save lives in the long run .
Secondly , revealing the result of genetic testing would help in making important life decisions .
In the case of Huntington's disease , a lethal genetic disorder , the result is also desired by family members and potential mates as it would help them to make important decisions , such as whether or not to have children or abort an affected fetus .
Under this circumstance , the final say of revealing the result should lie on the physician , who has a better understanding on the patient's condition .
Although the general agreement seems that disclosure of testing result should not over the patient's objection , this would be an exception if it is to protect third party to avoid other serious consequences (Mehlman & Maxwell , 1999) .
In conclusion , result of genetic testing should be revealed without the consent of the person who requested it as this would not only enable third party to get early prevention or treatment but also help others to make life decisions .
Genetic testing is able to analyze whether a subject is confirm to develop or inherit a particular genetic disease .
It assures the patient whether they are a carrier or will develop the disease .
Although the results are beneficial , it has implicated family members who are genetically common .
But are they able to inform the family members to safeguard their personal health yet not breaching the issues of confidentiality and privacy ?
My stand is as long disclosure has no serious social/ethical consequences , the subject will have the final say .
In conclusion , genetic testing is bound to bring ethical or social consequences if privacy and confidentiality are not met .
Regulatory framework such as Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act has ensured genetic discrimination is legislated .
With imposing law , people feels safer to undergo genetic testing; being the deciding factor to disclose their genetic results to family members or third party under their obligations .

The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should not be banned .
One pivoting reason to why RFID should not be banned includes its application to augment public and national security .
Repeated offenders and past sexual criminals can be tracked via RFID to allow for preventive measures if they are detected near places where they usually commit their crimes in .
(Brady , 2008 , para .
6) Similarly , monitoring of terrorist suspects for any suspicious movements and contact to insurgent groups can be aided by a RFID implant .
Furthermore , these suspects could then benefit from the freedom unobtainable inside of detention centres , while simultaneously alleviating the problems faced by overcrowded prisons (McKay , 2008) .
Without RFID , these would be nearly impossible due to limited security manpower .
In addition , using RFID to track a person's information can play a crucial role in medical services .
In the near future , people may opt to implant a RFID storing key medical data such as blood type and allergies into their bodies .
During a case of an unfortunate accident , medical officers would be able to gather these data almost instantaneously from a possibly unconscious patient .
The time saved from medical tests prior to an emergency operation might then improve the chances of a successful attempt to save the patient's life .
With proper regulation and use , RFID tagging may on the contrary to many arguments , ensue greater freedom and privacy given to the person implanted with RFID .
For example , as an alternative to incarceration , criminal suspects could opt to be electronically monitored in the outside world (How fair , n .d . , para .
7) .
While some may argue that such technology may be misused , laws such as imposing a mandatory need of consent from the people involved and a restriction to the ownership of RFID readers can be instituted instead of a total ban .
Thus , with the complement of these regulations to the inexhaustible list of benefits , the usage of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should not be banned .
Rapid advances in genetic research and technology led to important advances in the detection of genetic conditions and diseases (Chris and Bryn 2002) .
Genetic testing have however raised ethical concerns like whether the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing (Chris and Bryn 2002) .
There are severe consequences if the results are not handled and communicate properly by third parties .
Therefore , individuals should have the final say .
Individuals are to be treated equally as required by law unless there are relevant reasons like differences in skill , knowledge or experience (Chris and Bryn 2002) .
However , it is very likely that employers will use the results to discriminate employees based on unfounded perceptions of health risks and possible future disabilities (Chris and Bryn 2002) (Neil and Ronald 2006) .
Likewise , the insurance companies may make use of the results to charge a higher premium or not provide insurance because of possible chances of high medical bills in the future (Chris and Bryn 2002) (Neil and Ronald 2006) .
Thirumoorthy T . Medical Confidentiality [Internet] [cited 2009 Sep 16] .
Available from: www .sma .org .sg/whatsnew/ethics/Y1_S8_thiru .ppt
Doctors have to adhere to medical ethics , in which they required to respect the confidentiality of the patients (Thirumoorthy 2009) .
Both the Hippocratic Oath and International Code of Ethics states that without the prior consent from the patient , doctor are not allowed to disclose any information which he has obtained (Thirumoorthy 2009) .
Hence , by revealing the genetic testing result without permission from the individual , it constitutes a breach of medical confidentiality .
Even to family members , individuals should have the final say .
Like the phrase , "Ignorance is bliss" , if the results are not related to the family members or they have lower risk of getting the genetic disorder , telling them may cause unnecessary worries (Agatha , Denise and Kathleen 2009) (Gillian , Denise and Bartha 2009) .
There are also considerations like age and maturity level (Gillian , Denise and Bartha 2009) .
If the family member is old and no longer under high risk or a child who is too young to be at risk , there is no need to reveal disturbing results that may cause potential psychological harm to them (Agatha , Denise and Kathleen 2009) (Gillian , Denise and Bartha 2009) .
Some individuals may also be waiting for the "right time" , such as avoiding the need to disrupt or jeopardize major life events like graduation , marriage , pregnancy , childbirth (Gillian , Denise and Bartha 2009) .
In addition , the individual might not even be close to their family members .
In fact , there may even be bad blood between them .
The family members may instead use the results against the individual .
In conclusion , the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of genetic testing .

"The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned ."
In this 21st century , modern technology has advanced to a stage where radio frequency identification (RFID) is implanted into people to locate and identify them .
RFID is a chip that has a small antenna to transmit vast amount of information from a human's body to a computer using a scanner (Sade , 2007 , p . 1) .
RFID enhances productivity in the healthcare system , helps to monitor ex-offenders and also helps to locate missing personnel .
Thus , due to the benefits brought about by RFID , it should not be banned .
Firstly , the use of RFID to identify patients enhances productivity in the healthcare system (Sade , 2007 , p .2) .
The use of RFID can minimize the long registration time for patients so that they are able to seek treatment in the shortest possible time .
When a patient goes to the hospital , his medical records which are already stored in a RFID tag can be immediately traced out using the RFID scanner .
In doing so , time could be greatly minimized and many more innocent lives will be saved .
Hence , the use of RFID is greatly beneficial in the medical field .
Secondly , implanting RFID tags into ex-offenders facilitates the authorities in monitoring their activities .
Police will be alerted in the shortest possible time when these ex-offenders are in a position that may harm victims (Rfid based proximity sensor and alert system for fugitives , sex offenders , missing soldiers and the like description/claims , 2008) .
This helps to save innocent lives and reduce crime rate in the country .
It also allows ex-offenders to have their freedom and at the same time , the police will be alerted when they commit a crime .
This gives the public a sense of security and hence , the use of RFID to monitor ex-offenders is beneficial to the society .
Thirdly , RFID can also help to locate missing personnel .
People who are embedded with the tag would be scanned and their location can easily be found .
This is especially useful for the elderly who suffer from dementia .
When they are not able to find their way home , their family members can make use of RFID technology to track them down .
Hence , the use of RFID greatly speeds up the tedious process of finding missing personnel and at the same time , minimizes wastage of resources .
In conclusion , with these benefits that RFID have brought to people , it is undeniable that using RFID to track people will only improve the current situation and hence , it should not be banned .
Technological advances have brought along pros and cons ever since it sets in to our daily lives .
One of the many technologies innovated is the surveillance technology , mainly RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) .
'Tracking' , in this context , is defined as both monitoring and identifying the location , behavior , activities and changing information such as medical information .
Admittedly , personal privacy will be intruded .
Nevertheless , it has the ability to track criminals , improve the efficiency of our healthcare system , as well as to expedite the cracking of criminal cases .
Therefore , owing to the significant advantages of RFID , it should not be banned .
Tracking activities plays a crucial role in identifying terrorists and monitoring ex-criminals .
By implanting the RFID tags in both groups , their location will remain known to the police force and relevant authorities , thus allowing consistent monitoring of activities .
It has always been a common objective between countries to wipe out terrorism (Rhea Wessel , 2006) so that world peace could be maintained .
Adding on , monitoring ex- criminals will not only forbid them from committing crimes again , but more importantly , allow the public to have a peace of mind employing them , subsequently making them feel accepted by the society .
Therefore , given the advantages of surveillance technology , it should not be banned .
Surveillance technology such as RFID can improve two components of our healthcare system .
Firstly , it cuts down on the waiting time to be attended to .
A scan on the tags allows healthcare personnel to instantly identify the medical information of patients .
Secondly , wasted time on retrieving essential information of patients during emergency could be put into treating the patients (http://www .verichipcorp .com) .
Crucial moments could determine life and death .
Therefore , the RFID technology can better our healthcare system's efficiency .
Expediting the cracking of criminal cases is another point to why surveillance technology should not be banned .
Tracking locations could never be more important in cases such as kidnapping (http://www .verichipcorp .com) .
Crimes like this should be attended to in the shortest possible time as it may result in injuries or even death of victims .
Furthermore , it could lower the crime rate , thus benefiting all people .
Hence , surveillance technology can assist in cracking criminal cases .
In all , surveillance technology benefits us greatly in several aspects and thus should not be banned .
"The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned ."
Surveillance technology in the form of Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) has brought about many improvements in the efficiency and procedure of our systems .
RFID is an electronic method of exchanging data over radio frequency waves .
My article will focus on the uses and advantages of RFID to track people .
Tracking is defined to be locating the whereabouts of a person and the identification of personal information .
I strongly believe that the proper handling of such technology will bring countless advantages and thus , the use of RFID to track people should not be banned .
The use of RFID to track criminals will improve the safety and security within a prison and ultimately , improve the overall national security .
Tracking criminals will allow the prison security to know the exact location of every inmate .
This will minimise the risk of violence and prisoners escaping .
This is being supported by statistics done by correctional institutions that cases of violence decreased by 65 percent when the RFID system was introduced (Casciato 2008) .
Even when such events occur , the investigation and the recapturing of those involved would be more easily dealt with the use of RFID .
Incorporating the use of RFID in the healthcare industry will improve the efficiency and current practice of the sector .
The storage of key medical records and information in a radio-transmitting chip will cut down time spent on registration and thus , allowing patients to receive prompt treatment .
In times of emergency when key information such as blood type and allergy could be retrieved at an instant by scanning the chip , the most appropriate treatment can be decided in the shortest possible time .
This can prove to be vital in saving a person's live .
Lastly , the use of RFID to locate the whereabouts of children can help to reduce incidents of human trafficking .
In less developed countries like Cambodia , there is a large volume of children being trafficked and forced into labour and prostitution .
With the use of RFID to locate a victim , it will allow the authorities to capture the people behind such activities and provides a solution to the problem of human trafficking .
In conclusion , the benefits that RFID brings are immeasurable and thus , the use of it to track people should not be banned .
In all , RFID should be banned as it not only invades our privacy and it may impose serious risk to our human body .

With the advanced Science and technologies , potential diseases become predictable nowadays .
For instance , a ten years-old child could undergo a genetic testing and predict the risk of getting Huntingdon's disease in middle age .
This achievement , however , raises a controversy of whether an individual who requests genetic testing should have the final say to reveal or not reveal the results of such testing .
Since the disclosure might bring negative effects to the individual's family and induce discrimination in employment as well as the purchase of insurance , I would like to agree with the statement of having right to decide the revealing of genetic test result .
When an individual is tested positive for hereditary disease , disclosure of the result might impact his family negatively .
Family tension would be created if the revealing of the result happens at inappropriate moment .
Agatha M . Gallo and her colleagues (2001) note that the decision of disclosing genetic testing result should be made by considering some major life events such as graduation and marriage (Am J Nurs . , 2001 , To disclose or not to disclose ?
section ,  3) .
This is obvious and could be imagined that when the individual discloses the information to his brother who is doing preparation for the A-level final examination , for example , the latter would be overwhelmed with stresses whereby affecting his performance during the examination .
In a nut shell , disclosure of an individual's genetic testing information might incur woes in his life .
Everybody should be considerate and let the individual to decide whether he is willing to reveal the test result .
He should have the final say .
Technological advancements in the medical field today have offered us a variety of genetic tests .
Although this technology is beneficial to mankind , there is an ongoing controversy pertaining to the question on who should have the final say in revealing the test result to a third party .
While some may argued that doctors should reveal the result as it may directly affect a third party , we should still look into the concerns individuals have , such as the loss of employment and insurance after the results are made known , their rights to privacy and medical confidentiality and family considerations .
Firstly , all individuals should have the rights to make decisions that will affect their future .
In recent years , the Council for Responsible Genetics (CRG) had found that employers and insurance companies are increasingly biased against people who tested positive in a genetic test .
This practice is currently known as 'Genetic Discrimination' (CRG 2001) .
With this practice in place , individuals will never be treated fairly and their prospects will not be bright , especially in this economic downturn .
Besides employment , individuals may also be denied the much needed insurance to protect themselves against any future mishaps (CRG 2001) .
Secondly , individual's rights to privacy and confidentiality must be observed .
In the United States , doctors are obliged to adhere to the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identiable Health Information (Privacy Rule) (Sharpe and Carter 2006) .
This would mean that they have to respect the patient's decision on whether to reveal the genetic test result .
However , in cases where revealing the result is necessary to prevent an imminent threat to others , doctors are able to make this decision on behalf of the patient (Sharpe and Carter 2006) .
Despite this , doctors should make careful analysis before making the decision so as not to infringe unnecessarily into the privacy of the individual .
Lastly , individuals are able to factor in family considerations when deciding whether to reveal the result to the relatives .
Some of the factors that affect the individual's decision are the vulnerability and receptivity of relatives towards the result , the timing for revealing the result , and also the family relationships between the relatives (Nycum , Avard and Knoppers 2008) .
Doctors would never consider these factors comprehensively if they were to have the final say in the revealing the test results .
In conclusion , individuals should have the final say in whether to reveal the genetic test result if it does not pose an imminent threat to a third party .
This is because the process involves their family members , their rights on making decisions that will affect their future and also their rights to privacy and confidentiality .

Topic: The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such thing .
Nowadays , with advanced medical technology , people can apply genetic testing to identify changes in chromosomes , genes , or proteins(Genetic Home Reference , 2009) .
This kind of technique provides convincing results of the gene information that the individual carries .
While as it is more and more widely used in medical test , how to deal with the results appropriately brings fierce debates on ethic and other issues .
Some claim that the results of genetic testing belong to the privacy of the person , therefore whether to reveal them should depend on the individual himself .
However , if the final decision just depends on the individual , it will not only curb the genetic research development but also delay the precaution of potential risk that some genes convey .
Thus , the individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such thing .
In conclusion , the final say on whether to reveal the results of genetic testing should not depend on the individual as it not only has negative effects on genetic research development but also delays the precaution of potential health risk .
Thus , the individual should not act as judges to decide whether to reveal the results of genetic testing .
Surveillance is the systematic supervision or monitoring of the movement or information of an individual or a population .
(Bogonikolos , 1999) .
In recent years , numerous state-of-the-art surveillance devices and software emerged rapidly .
These surveillance technologies bring great advantages in authorization of law enforcement authorities by monitoring and securing prosecution evidence on criminal and terrorist activities .
However , its thorough interception capability and high cost consumption raised strong controversies .
The resulting consequences discussed below will further consolidate our claim that surveillance technology usage should be banned .
Firstly , surveillance technology performed on large population implies violation of privacy and civil rights .
Government agencies conduct mass surveillance on social networking sites , phone calls and broadband internet traffic hence covertly record civilian's private or confidential data .
In addition , corporate companies and central banks embedded RFID chips into products and paper notes with original purposes of tracking purchased products and cash passage between individuals .
(Yoshida , 2001; Eden 2005) However , an individual's anonymity and privacy will be gone simply when RFID scanners reveal one's personal interests , purchase records , money transaction and current location .
Likewise , modern corporate companies profaned employee's privacy by monitoring their performance at workplace , checking their email and phone log and tracking their movement at working hours .
(Moore , 2000) Hence , disclosure and storage of personal information of those under mass surveillance lead to invasion of privacy and confidentiality .

In addition , lump sum government expenditure on surveillance implementation and maintenance is considered resources wastage .
For instance , estimations suggest that installation of nationwide surveillance network around China will account for $33 billion by year 2010 , which is "around the same amount Congress has allocated for reconstructing Iraq" .
(Klein , 2008 , p . 6) Moreover , scientific research showed that majority public surveillance camera reduces crime merely to a slight degree which failed to overweigh annual equivalent cost .
(Gill & Spriggs , 2005) Nevertheless , poor image quality of surveillance camera video footage caused by excessive compression and minimized storage (Morton , 2005) space is considered worthless evidence to prosecute suspected offenders .
In fact , large amount of government grants on surveillance technology implementation can be alternatively invested on issues of greater importance namely eradication of poverty , famine and diseases control .
In conclusion , surveillance technology should be banned as consequences including violation civilian's privacy and wastage of national resources results .

According to a survey , the using of RFID tagging systems and its related technologies in the domain of healthcare will have a rapid growth from $90 million in 2006 to $2 .1 billion in 2016 CITATION Rap06 \l 2052 (Rapid adoption of RFID in healthcare , 2006) .
This is a very good evidence to show that the surveillance technology is becoming more and more widespread in current society , especially in our daily healthcare apartments .
Some data indicates that RFID technology can really help us a lot in saving the patients' lives , preventing errors caused by doctors and providing a more safe operation environment .
Firstly , it can give the patients more freedom by getting rid of those long and boring procedures CITATION Rap06 \l 2052 (Rapid adoption of RFID in healthcare , 2006) .
Usually these procedures require the patients to suffer quite a lot and need many efforts from the attendants .
Secondly , it can reduce the possibility of errors which may happen in the process .
One basic theory is using an electronic handshake spectrum to prevent the wrong procedures from happening .
Thirdly , it provides us a lot of convenience because as a result of the widespread of this technology , some old and needy patients can be cared and thus under safe condition anywhere .
By planting this device into their body , we can detect where they are in case some urgent diseases break out .
"The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned ."
It was reported that during the September 11 terrorist attacks , fire fighters wrote their names on their arms for fear that they would be unidentified by their family members if they are disfigured .
(Kanellos , 2004 , There's not a lot of middle ground on the subject of implanting electronic identification chips in humans , para 4) This news offers us food for thought if the use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be permitted .
Admittedly , the use of surveillance technology may invade one's privacy .
Nonetheless , it is more persuasive to believe that surveillance technology helps in tracking of properties and improvements in medical care .
Hence , the use of surveillance technology should not be banned .
Firstly , businessmen contend that the use of surveillance technology facilitates the tracking of properties .
RFID tags can be inserted into objects to monitor the sales and quality of products .
This would ensure easier documentation of items sold and companies could improve their operations efficiency .
An illustration is a shopping mall , Wal-Mart , which is using tagging devices in its products in order to update their supply chain (Srivastava , 2007 , Shopping and dining out , para 1) .
However , critics argue that the accumulation of data may be susceptible to theft and misuse (Kanellos , 2004 , Tagging hospital patients . . . and alumni , para 7) .
With rapid advancements in technology , abusers can tag on RFID tags and misappropriate the data .
(Kanellos , 2004 , Tagging hospital patients . . . and alumni , para 8) .
This may lead to the loss of companies' privacy if confidential information were obtained .
Nevertheless , this concern may be overrated as Sriviastava (2007) claimed that devices such as 'tag killings' are available to safeguard the information stored in the RFID tags .
Hence , the use of surveillance technology should not be banned .
Secondly , medical professionals assert that the use of surveillance technology aids in improvements in medical care .
Patients' health could be monitored and checked regularly with the use of RFID tags .
(Kanellos , 2004 , Tagging hospital patients . . . and alumni , para 3) With this , the medical reports of patients can be shared and obtained easily by hospitals which will facilitate the diagnosis and prescription of drugs for the patients .
In addition , abduction of babies are minimised with increased security .
(Srivastava , 2007 , Sports and health , para 4)
In all , the use of surveillance technology should not be banned as it facilitates tracking of information and medical care .
As technology progresses , one may expect more surveillance devices to be developed in the near future .
The usage of surveillance technology such as RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) on people or products has been a hot topic debated by both supporters and critics .
RFID tags has been introduced to the general public , but remains theoretical until the 11th September ,2001 attack .
The idea came when a technology executive discovered that RFID tags may be used for identification if a body becomes disfigured or unrecognizable in an accident .
Thus , the RFID technology starts to materialize and propagates in public which causes commotions pertaining to privacy and ethical issues aroused from the usage of such technology .
Albeit the risk of privacy invasion , RFID tags are potential devices which do benefits a lot to humans if executed under strict regulations .
First and foremost , with the RFID surveillance technology , personal safety in public places can be enhanced .
By having RFID attached to a person , especially children , their whereabouts can be constantly watched by their parents and increases the safeguarding of their children .
However , there are issues concerning the dependence of technology instead of parents giving full attention towards their children by their own effort , and thus decreasing their sense of responsibility as a caretaker .
But with RFID tags , their children can remain safe and sound by lowering the case of being injured or lost as the devices can detect straightaway if such situations happen .
Therefore , RFID tags are efficacious devices in monitoring the situation of children .
Surveillance is no longer unfamiliar in the era of technology-based society .
Surveillance , according to Bogonikolos (1999) , is the systematic investigation or monitoring of behaviour or intercourse of one person or a group .
It is professionally used by the executive authorities and the governments , especially the Ministry of Defence .
Nonetheless , the generalization of certain simple surveillance technologies causes their existence to be found everywhere .
Although surveillance can be utilized widely in the aspects of health and medical , protection against terrorist attack and security purposes , abuse usage of such technology will bring us negative impacts .
Thus , in my opinion , surveillance should be banned under certain circumstances .
There is much controversy raised on the disadvantages of surveillance technology nowadays , particularly in term of privacy .
Privacy can be defined as "the condition of not having undocumented personal knowledge about one possessed by others" .
(D . Moore , 2000 , p .698) Recently , home surveillance becomes more well-liked among nuclear families .
Since most couples in this competitive era have their own business or enterprise , home surveillance is then installed in order to guard their residence .
However , this might cause severe effect in which home and individual privacies are invaded once the mechanism is hacked with a little technical skill .
Besides that , even though camera surveillance used in educational institutions is purposely to secure the safety of students , "the majority of the schemes evaluated did not reduce crime and even where there was a reduction this was mostly not due to CCTV; nor did CCTV schemes make people feel safer , much less change their behaviour ."
(Gill & Spriggs , 2005 , p .115) As a result , the setup of CCTV not only dissipates the expenditure , but also reduces the freedom space of students .
On the other hand , surveillance technology also influences the psychological condition of individuals .
For instance , installation of surveillance technology in workplaces more or less will lower the task performance of employees .
While monitoring the employees with video surveillance along working , they may feel uneasy on their movements .
At the same time , monitoring also reduces the liability between employers and employees , and results in the decrease in morale in the latter .
(Bryant , 2006 , para .11)
In conclusion , the effects of surveillance technology surrounding us are based on both major and minor premises , which are privacy and right of freedom of individuals , as well as the psychological condition .
Hence , these have strengthened our standpoint that surveillance technology should be banned .

Rapidly rising availability of surveillance technology have made it possible to yield information about the locations of people .
This has raised issues concerning the collection , use and disclosure of personal data .
Nonetheless , the use of surveillance technology adds convenience and offers opportunities for improvement in our daily lives , from personal safety to health .
Due to the potential technological benefits which could impact human lives , it should not be banned .
Although the use of surveillance technology may lead to undesirable implications , they are highly unlikely to happen .
Some opponents of surveillance technology have argued that its use would invade their privacy and the information might also be distributed to unauthorised parties without consent (Srivastava , 2007 , para .
31) .
However , a series of technical countermeasures , policies and regulatory initiatives had been introduced to minimise and possibly prevent these adverse effects (Srivastava , 2007 , para .

Hence , the use of surveillance technology to track people would still be effective and beneficial in our society , as long as the appropriate approaches are applied .
In conclusion , the use of surveillance technology would be constructive to many aspects of our daily life as the benefits far outweigh the societal concerns .
As a result , the use of surveillance technology to track people should not be banned .

The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned
RFID , security cameras , Global Positioning Systems (GPS) on mobile phone and some eavesdropping device are some of the common surveillance gadget used by the FBI and police .
In the 20th centaury , the best weapon against terrorism is no longer bullets and bomb , the focus is to prevent criminal activities before it happens , hence , information is the key .
(Piller & Lichtblau , July29 2002)
Surveillance technology can also be used in the medical fields .
Presbyterian Hospital in Charlotte , North Carolina came out with a RFID infant protection system where a RFID chips was tagged onto the infant .
(Two Stories Highlight the RFID Debate , July19 2005) The security system will sound off if the infant was being illegally removed from the nursery .
This system successfully recovered a kidnapped infant by using RFID signal on the tagged baby to track its location .
GPS chip was also placed on Alzheimer's patient shoes to track their whereabouts .
Patient with this disease can be easily disoriented , hence , causing them to lose their way .
(Wong , Jun10 2009) The use of surveillance technology can help the patient's family members to locate them and bring them home safely .
From just the above example , we can see that the advantages of using surveillance technology overweigh its disadvantages .
In conclusion , we can impose law and limit the use of surveillance technology but we cannot ban it .
Topic2: "The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing ."
Genetic testing has evolved and is now more prevalent in our modern society .
In light of this ubiquitous and accessible availability of genetic testing , many have started to question the problems that are associated to the results .
The question now is whether an individual should decide whether to release the results to others or the results to be revealed regardless of his approval .
There are evidences that the latter proved more beneficial to both the patient and others around him .
Accessible genetic results are also important to patients and their families .
Patients with positive test results will be susceptible to physical and emotional stress and thus will need support from his loved ones .
(Sharing Genetic Test Results With Your Family , 2009 , para .
2) .
Moreover , the results may also shed some light to certain predominant problems that the entire family may be susceptible to in the near future .
This will allow relatives to start early treatment before the disease develops .
(Sharing Genetic Test Results With Your Family , 2009 , para .
7) .
Therefore , availability of genetic information will help ease the pressure on the patient and also allow many to go through early treatment or take preventive measures .
Albeit many believe in human rights as well as the protection of one's interest , there are many other prevailing factors that tip the balance toward releasing results and making it readily available for the good of the patient and his surrounding people .
Genetic testing is the examination of the fundamental human genetic information , so as to access an individual's risk of contracting diseases .
Although this advance in technology proves to be a significant breakthrough in the medical field , social problems in the form of genetic discrimination could be the likely consequences .
Thus , individuals undergoing genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results as they are the ones who will likely face discrimination .
Employment is one area of discrimination .
Individuals tested to have risks of suffering from diseases that could affect their working abilities would very unlikely be employed by profit-driven companies .
From the employers' point of view , these individuals would likely take medical leaves often to consult treatments , and could be lower in productivity .
One example of such discrimination was experienced by Eddy Curry , a former Chicago Bulls player .
In 2005 , Curry was forced to leave for the New York Knicks after his refusal to a genetic test aimed to determine if players were susceptible to a heart ailment (Harmon , 2008) .
Hence , employers would likely use genetic testing to gauge a potential employee's productivity and worth .
To eliminate discrimination in the workforce , individuals undergoing the test should be given the final say .
Individuals could also face genetic discrimination from insurance companies .
Insurance companies function by collecting premiums from many separate individuals and paying large amounts to only some of the insured .
The rest of the sum collected would be the company's profits .
Hence , if genetic testing results are available to the insurers , they would likely exploit it by increasing the premiums to be paid by the individuals tested positive to diseases , or declining them the policies .
This form of discrimination does exist , and laws have been imposed to alleviate this problem .
For example , the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act was introduced to stop the misuse of genetic testing results by insurers (Harmon , 2008) .
Thus , to more effectively alleviate discrimination from insurers , individuals should have the final say .
To conclude , genetic discrimination can be alleviated if the individuals have the final say in whether to reveal their genetic results .
Technological advances have eased the carry out of surveillance activities .
Some suggest application of surveillance technology is advantageous in the safeguard of credentials , protection of national security and enhancement of business and commerce sectors .
However the same technology can also be used to track people and intrude private information .
Concerns are raised on the moral and ethical issues surrounding the latter usage of such technology .
In fact , the intrusion of people's privacy has become more serious when surveillance technology is abused that such technology used in tracking people should be banned .
Two issues are discussed .
Both support the fact that surveillance technology create risks to privacy that far outweigh the technology's heralded benefits .
Firstly it is said that it actually enables identity thieves , stalkers and other criminals to commit "contactless" crimes against victims who won't immediately know they've been violated (Consumer Watchdog , 2009) .
In February 2005 , when the State Department (US) asked for public comment on the implementation of Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) in passport booklets , of the 2 ,335 comments received , 98 .5 percent were negative , with 86 percent expressing security or privacy concerns , the department reported in an October 2005 notice in the Federal Register (Lewan , 2009) .
Indeed , the fear of losing privacy is a distressing concern among the society .
Secondly , tracking devices such as online behavioural tracking systems can be used to target vulnerable consumers for high-price loans , bogus health cures and other potentially harmful products and services ," said Susan Grant , director of Consumer Protection at Consumer Federation of America (Consumer Watchdog , 2009) .
Nowadays electronic information from consumers is "collected , compiled and sold" (Consumer Watchdog , 2009) without reasonable safeguards and therefore poses a threat to the exposure of private matters of consumers that may lead to abuse of such information for certain benefits or intentions .
In conclusion , surveillance technology should be banned as it not only intrudes privacy but also pose a risk to personal security .
While surveillance has been a part of society since the widespread Cabinet Noir splinter (Encyclopedia Britannica , 1911) of the postal organisation during Louis XIII reign , only recent development in technology has made it possible for the intrusion into the private lives of individuals on such a grandiose scale specifically with regards to the wide scale tracking of movement .
The application of tracking technology has spurned heated debates from both public and private sectors .
The acceptance of RFID (Radio frequency identification) and commercial data mining to serve behavioural advertising has raised concerns with privacy groups and computer experts due to potential of abuse being present .
While RFID has proven itself as a worthy tool in combating terrorism on an international scale , it has also opened a window of opportunity for criminals who do not require contact such as identity thieves and stalkers to prey on countless unknowing victims exploiting the fundamental flaw of each RFID chip; as Neville Pattinson (2007) stated: "'each chip is built to faithfully transmit its unique identifier'" (Lewan , 2009) which it does with no consensual oversight .
Another contentious issue is the potential quasi-legal practice of collecting the information of political dissidents gathered at legitimate rallies by the government .
Behavioural advertising on the other hand has invaded the individual's right to safeguard their personal information and browsing habits .
The web users whom have been targeted by the advertorial companies have lost all meaningful control (Report on Consumer Watchdog; Consumer and Privacy Groups Urge Congress to Enact Consumer Privacy Guarantees , 2009) over the use of their personal data which is often shared with third parties for financial gain oblivious to the victim's lack of consent .
Surveillance technology even when well intentioned has been proven to have too many potential pitfalls to be ignored .
The rise in the infringement of individual privacy by malicious people and oppressive government shows no sign of slowing down due to continual evolution in both legitimate technology and the resourcefulness of criminals to exploit it .
In conclusion , the relative gains in accessibility and efficiency does not give carte blanche for private organisations or governmental agencies to push forth dubious surveillance technology regardless of how well intentioned it may be .
The individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing .
In recent years , development in technologies of genetic testing has increased the ease of access for individuals to genetic tests .
Genetic tests are laboratory techniques used to determine whether a person has or probability of getting a genetic disorder .
Some examples of genetic testing are diagnostic testing and pre-natal testing (Mehlman , 1999 , para 1) .
These individuals should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such tests .
Individuals should maintain their rights in whether to reveal the results of such testing is so that they can protect themselves from genetic discrimination .
Such discrimination could appear in the area of employment , where companies use the results of genetic tests to influence the employment prospects of an individual .
For example in 2005 , a Chicago Bulls basketball player named Eddy Curry was sold to the New York Knicks because he refused to take a genetic test to check if he was predisposed to a heart ailment (Harmon , 2008 , Caught in a Bind , para 8) .
So what if the he had taken the test and was diagnosed with having a higher possibility of developing heart problem ?
He would probably be sold to another team even though he could be a good player .
This would be unfair for the individual .
Thus , to protect themselves from genetic discrimination , individuals should maintain their rights in having the final say whether to reveal results of genetic testing .
Another reason for individuals to maintain their rights in revelation of genetic testing result is so as to allow individuals to enjoy the benefits that genetic testing can bring .
Because of the potential discriminations that individuals could face due to their results of genetic testing , many chose not to take the test .
Even with the improvement of the technologies related to genetic diseases , these individuals are denied of the opportunities to prevent , or even treat the genetic disease that could be present .
If the results of genetic testing are to be forcefully revealed , less people will be willing to even go for the test .
Hence , to allow individuals to have the chance to know more of the preventive measures or possible treatment , they should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of genetic testing .
In conclusion , there are consequences the individuals have to consider whether to reveal their result of genetic test .
If they are forced to reveal , they could be subjected to unfair treatment and be void of the benefits of genetic test .
Thus , individuals should maintain their right to decide whether they want to reveal the result of their genetic test .
