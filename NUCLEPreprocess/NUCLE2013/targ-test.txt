Infectious disease is also a life killer .
Not long from now SARS , as blurry a memory as it is , attacked people all around the world .
Since no one knew about this disease before , it spread around the whole world before humans took action .
The spreading speed was so fast that plenty of people died before knowing about it .
An atmosphere of death covered the whole world .
The expression of desperation can be seen everywhere .
War kills a lot of people , which is not doubted .
After going through the WW1 and WW2 , the population on the earth got much fewer .
Because  technology was not developed enough or because there were wars and battles one after another , people just did not live a long life .
Hence , as technology especially in the medical field continues to get developed and updated , people do not risk their lives anymore .
People are happy to see that they can finally live a long life without sacrificing their blood in battles and with more and more perfect medical insurance .
The medical equipment and staff are getting more and more today .
Although some countries in Africa and Southeast Asia still face a lack of medical insurance , the world in all is getting better in this field .
With modern machines and growing methds , humans do not need to worry about the amount of food anymore .
All the achievements humans make influence the lifespan of people .
That is why population ageing can be seen as an achievement .
Population ageing is not all about the good side of the society though .
As  society develops , people gradually find that population ageing has brought us many problems .
With more and more people not working at all and receiving an allowance from the government ,  society's balance has been broken .
It is difficult to keep the economy functioning well .
Times change; people change .
Many young people do not view things like their parents used to do .
Many young people choose not to have kids or have fewer kids than before .
This problem is very common in developed countries .
With a more perfect system with the older and more modern equipment , population ageing always comes first .
The governments are seeking solutions to solve this problem .
For example , they encourage people to have more children by awarding them .
They pull up the age to retire .
No matter what measures they take ,  population ageing still remains a serious problem and that is where the challenge lies .
RFID is used in many forms for example , transportation , homes and even offices .
Over the years , it has helped humans to improve accessibility in the form of cards to gain access to certain places .
Other than using it in these areas , it is also been used as a human implant or as aproduct .
These implants and products have also been used as surveillance tools .
As a surveillance tool , it could also be used in terms of surveys and statistics .
There are also medical tools that are more of an implant into the human body for basic medical research .
Moreover , the use of RFID chips in tracking clothes is also very common sight in the service industry becaueof the huge number of clothing to be identified and tracked  at any one point .
As RFID has been used in  transportation  in the form of ez-link cards , the ability to gain faster and easier access of  transportation needs has been seen over the years .
This form can also be used as a tracking device because the places a person visited for the past few trips were all recorded by the system and the cards .
This form of tracking is not harmful and disturbing to  society as it could be used to fight crimes to maintain law and order .
As this information is been well-kept by the operators because they encrypt the data and use it in its proper form .
This also prevents  normal hackers from getting this information that was recorded for proper usage  for unlawful usage .
If their medical history is all recorded in the chip , the person's life may be savedMoreover , Moreover , the use of the RFID for medical research has also been widely used in many countries .
These chips were also implanted under the human skin where they also help to store the basic information of the person   .
This form of tools does not harm but it helps in the ability to identify any person who is not carrying any identification when comes to emergency .
may be  save the person's life If their medical history is all recorded in the chip .
Additionally , the service industry is also using it to track its clothes that were been used by their employees .
This is a scene seen in Resort World Sentosa .
The clothes were all implanted with an RFID tracking chip for easy identification and recording of the whereabouts the clothes is at .
As their clothes were mass collected and washed by an external company , the ability to have a tracking system to know the whereabouts of their clothing helps in terms of  logistical hassle .
Therefore , the usage of RFID chips is more useful to help the human in the basic needs or task that is required .
This form of tracking is also not harmful to any person because  much of this information is all used for helping a person then disrupt the lives of human race .
Therefore , I agree that the use of the RFID technology in tracking any person or product  would help the human race which also has been mentioned above .
I think that surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) can be used to track people .
Nowadays , with the rapid development of science and technology , emerging technologies always contribute to better living conditions for human beings .
For example , the Internet has abridged the distance among people globally .
Although we have to admit some bad effects which are brought by the new technology , still the advantages of the new technologies cannot be simply discarded .
Back to the surveillance technology , people may say it leaks their privacy or personal life .
Compared to this disadvantage , we should think about the advantages it has make available for human beings .
It can provide a safe , convenient , identifiable environment .
Tracking people using surveillance technology can make people's life more convenient and identifiable .
Nowadays , people need of carrying a lot of ID cards around to show that they are the  .
If we have this technology , it will automatically confirm people's indemnification and save the effort to carry a lot of cards .
Once people have their own identity confirmed , they do not even need to bring any money along with them .
To purchase goods , they just need to deduce money from their identity and make a transition of money to the one who is selling the goods .
Because of the identifiable environment , a lot of conventional ways or styles of human life could be changed .
If the technology can be made to adjust to human being's feelings , it would be more welcomed by those concerned about privacy .
For example , if the one who carries the identifiable sensor does not want others to know his or her location , he or she can disable the tracking .
Then , you may ask , how can the police get the information ?
I think that the tracking can be saved in some place which is not open to public .
If it is very severe , the records could be opened for official use .
As you can see , there are quite a lot of advantages of using surveillance technology to track people .
In short , it can provide a safe , convenient , identifiable environment for human beings .
Moreover , we can try to reduce the bad effects caused by the new technology .
Thus , I strongly agree that surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) can be used to track people .
I do not agree with the above statement .
In my opinion , surveillance technology such as RFID should be used to track people though there does exist many problems if it is prevalent .
It can help to regulate people's behavior , control crime and prevent terrorism , and set up demographic data .
RFID , despite the fact that it may be considered as privacy infringement , is different from video surveillance .
Unlike video surveillance , RIFD can only reflect the location and movements of the person with tags .
Without sending back any images or sound record , RFID is more user-friendly and helps prevent the user's privacy at the best it can .
Firstly , RFID is a useful tool to help to regulate human or animal behavior .
The tags can be used on those who need to be taken care of or beloved ones , such as a child whose parents are always concerned about his whereabouts when the parents are not together with him , or maybe a lovely dog whose owner fears to lose her .
In the first case , RFID can be used to help parents to surveil their children so that they can make sure if they are at school or playing around at their friends' home , and this may help parents regulate their children's behavior .
Secondly , RFID can be used to control crime and prevent terrorism .
Everyday crimes happen from time to time , and  can be a combination of ethical , physiological and social problems .
RFID can be one of the trivial ways to help dispel criminal or terorist thoughts .
Police can put tags on those that have potential to commit crimes .
Thus , when a man with a 'terrorism tag' enters a junction or a plaza full of people , police should notice this and observe the man's behavior as well as checking his package to prevent him from exploding TNT .
Apart from preventing crime and terrorism , RFID can also be used as an evidence or alibi to help infer whether the suspect is the criminal or not .
Moreover , RFID can be used to help collect demographic data .
If RFID is used on everyone and runs for years , the surveillance centre will have a complete set of statistical data showing the movement of people from city to city , and from town to town , thus showing which city is expanding more than people thought , and which city is becoming less attractive .
Statisticians can use these data to build up appropriate models to predict the future needs for each city so that local governments know where and when to build more infrastructure , what kind of infrastructure and what other developments should be made .
Economists can take advantage of these figures to predict the economic trends of the local area as well as for the whole country .
As for transportation , the roads and traffic authority can easily identify where traffic jams are and advise drivers to change to suggested routes .
In all , RFID should be applied to facilitate governments to better manage the world that we are living .
It can help regulate behaviors , prevent crime and set up demographic data for various uses .
But before the application , governments need to secure the safety of RFID after implantation and make sure there will not be any ID theft .
More importantly , governments should make sure only the right people can get access to these data and they must guarantee that they will not misuse or abuse the information .
As technology becomes more advanced nowadays , people are very exposed to the various types in their daily lives .
It is undeniable that technology has made our lives and work easier and more efficient .
However , when surveillance technology starts to violate the privacy of people instead of being used in a more beneficialway , it is my opinion that such technology should be rethought  .
In fact , people are getting more exposed in public through the fast development of the virtual world -- the Internet .
Social networks such as Facebook ,Twitter and many others often reveal the true identities and some confidential information of the users without their being realised .
This already raises up the problem of privacy leakage .
The surveillance technology deteriorates the problem by stalking  people's privacy openly which may arouse anger and unhappiness among people .
This happened in London a few years ago , when the government installed CCTV on several streets in order to better supervise its people and keep the social order .
This was supposed to be applauded by the public because it allowed fast searches for people who violated the law and caused harm to others .
Instead , when the installment of such devices was released in the newspaper , it was heavily criticised by the public .
People were claiming the loss of privacy .
The government had to uninstall all the devices in the end .
From this case , we can clearly conclude that surveillance technology may be helpful in some ways; however , when it touches the privacy of people , it is unacceptable .
In conclusion , I think that surveilence technology should not be used to track people .
It not only restricts their freedom in all aspects  , but also causes leakage of personal information .
This greatly violates the rights of people .
