In fact , this was the major limitation of people's average life span in the past .
With advanced medical technology , not only many diseases can be cured , but also people know how to keep themselves healthy .
If developed health care system is increasing the positive side , it would be also helpful to reduce the negative side , which including reducing the hazards from the environment .
Health caring by far has been expensive to carry out .
If the environment is too dangerous to live in , there would be not sufficient medical resources for usage .
Such environmental hazards come from various aspects .
A major source of the hazards is the pollution .
A place with heavily polluted air and water is by no means a good habbitat and will bring a lot of health problems for its residents , among which aged people and children will be harmed most .
Only if the city is safe and comfortable can people live a longer and happier life .
If the above two aspects are described as the hardwares of the system , they do require a software to function , which is the ubiquitous good will for senior citizens .
When people become old , most of them join the weak group of citizens who have to live by receiving care from other people .
If a society has the most advanced medical science and the best environment , but do not grant the access to them to its senior citizens , it just does not help .
And if people in society do not want to care for their elderly , nothing will be done for them .
Only when there is a ubiquitous good will for senior citizens can the aged people live well , and that is a thing to be proud of .
With the glory , there comes problems .
To take care of old people , facillities such as nursing homes should be built , which add on to the expense of society .
An even larger share of the old people expense lies in the health care .
In addition , old people are weakened in many aspects , thus they are usually not considered as labors .
When the percentage of old people grows larger in the population , the labor is considered to become less and each labor need to pay more on the welfare of the old people .
In summary , the rising average life span is both a challenge and an achievement because it means the increase of the load and the advance of society , including at least advaced advanced health care system , reduced hazards from the environment and the ubiquitous good will for senior citizens , at the same time .
"The weak is meat and the strong eat it" does not apply nowadays .
The advance technology saves lots of lives which should never come to this world or should pass away .
For people , this is an achievement , but for nature , it changes its rule and cycle , which is a big challenge faced by human being .
If anyone has ever read any fiction or storied written before the 18th century , it is very hard to find any character in those stories lived longer than 80 years old .
They may die for hunger , die from illness or just went to bed as usual but never waked again .
In China , there is a famous saying that there are things should be celebrated , one is red and one is white .
Here , red thing means marriage and white means someone passing away .
The first time when I read this saying I am confused why someone passing away is a good thing that people should celebrate and later I was told that in past , it is hard to live longer than 60 years old and even though you are very lucky to live longer than 60 years old , you will suffer a lot from illness or the sadness for your young relatives passing away , so people think it is worth celebrating since they will not suffer any longer .
It is very hard to understand such a feeling as people felt in the past .
Now , technology and science develops at an unbelievably fast pace .
There is lots of illness that is thought incurable in the past vanished in the world .
Even though people with cancer , which is still hard to cure , now have more chance to survive and have a longer time to live .
Besides illness , the improvement of technology generates more food both in quantity and in quality .
In the same time , it also frees a great amount of labor .
Now people not only can have food to survive but also enjoy high-level food and even pursuing the tasty and luxury one .
It is a break-through of technology and science , and an outstanding achievement of human wisdom .
The world is always fair to us .
While we are celebrating for the break-through of our way to Utopia , we are suffering facing to a new challenge .
We cannot give up what we achieved in the past and follow the natural way die and reborn .
Therefore , the only way available for us to destroy such a balance is accelerating the progress of development so to increase the capacity of our planet .
As with the world is becoming more and more advanced , people are leading a more and more comfortable life .
Moreover , the life expectancies have also been raised due to the developing of the economy .
However , while we are enjoying the fruits carried be the development of the economy , we are also facing a global problem --- population ageing .
There is no doubt that this problem has become more and more serious which have gradually influenced the tendency of the population as well as the source allocation .
Therefore , the rising life expectancies can be considered both a challenge and an achievement .
On one side , we cannot deny that it is a great achievement with the rising life expectancies .
The reason why the life expectancies have aroused is that we are becoming more and more clever due to the evolution , and we are becoming richer and richer due to the knowledge we have learned .
Since that we get richer , we have more money to use to live a more comfortable life .
Therefore , because of the great efforts we have made , we have been living a better life .
And that is what we are striving for .
So the rising life expectancies can be regarded as a proof of what we have made to combat for ourselves .
On the other side , we have to say that obvious problems that we are facing are also caused by the rise of life expectancy .
Since that we have a better living circumstances and higher living quality , we are leading a longer life .
This seems to be a gratifying progress at the first sight .
However , during the process of making development to our life , we decide to reduce the rapid growth of population by adopting the measure of controlling birth so that the shortage of source allocation can also be slowed down .
This also works and we have also seen the effect .
Then there comes a problem .
Because that the birth rate is reduced while the death rate is also reduced , the percentage of the elderly is increased while that of the youth is decreased .
So the population is getting more and more aged .
But the primary labor force as well as the work force is from the youth .
That is to say , the population aging has aggravated the burden of the society .
Then we can see that the rising life expectancies can also be viewed as a challenge for us to face .
Taken together , we should say that the rise of life expectancies is two sided .
It has shown that we are leading a better life but we are forced to face the problem of solving population aging .
However , the achievement that we have made is far more than the problems caused by the challenges .
The significance of our existence is to leading a meaningful life and combat for the development of our world .
There is no absolute perfect way , so we have done a good job on the road .
Therefore , we need to continue on our striving as try our best to reduce the adverse impact that is carried .
Rising life expectancies is an achievement because it clearly demonstrates that overall quality of life is increasing in both developed and developing countries .
However , it is also a challenge because it strains both society and the environment .
It is well-known statistics that , generally , as a country develops the life expectancies increases .
This is the result of better quality of life; which is basically sufficient food and clean water , better sanitations and advanced health-care .
With sufficient food , children will develop properly into adults .
Better sanitations will result in fewer deaths by infection and significantly reduce the spread of diseases and viruses .
Advance healthcare is also a major factor in prolonging the individual's existence on earth .
Examples of how advance health in the city has raised life expectancies are such as antibiotics , the cure of poliomyelitis , and better and cleaner surgical procedures .
All of these are human achievements in their own rights that have resulted in rising life expectancies , and hence they also illustrates why rising expectancies can be considered an achievement .
It is remarkable that population aged 60 and over is increasing at 2% to 3% annually in developing countries as well .
It is highly plausible that the results for increase are the same as the developed countries .
If that is true , it means that human rights and living standards are increasing in developing countries , albeit slowly .
Fewer famines , better sanitations and more access to healthcare in developing countries will be this century's greatest achievement as a global society .
However , an aging population is taxing on a country .
Although life expectancies may increase significantly , the population overall productivity may not increase linearly .
They will end up putting a burden on the society that they have been contributing their whole working career .
With falling birth rates , there will be fewer working adults in society to distribute the workload .
In addition , an aging population will require more healthcare and treatment because one's constitution weakens as one ages .
The challenge is how many lives can the society and community afford to sustain; and it will only become increasingly difficult to handle .
Rising expectancies is also an environmental challenge because a better quality of life requires a lot of energy .
More food , clean water , better sanitation , and healthcare consume large quantities of energy .
An example is the modern method of intense farming .
Large quantities of energy are needed for the pesticides , and to harvest and transport the food produces around the globe .
If the current quality of life has to be sustained or increase in order to keep increasing the life expectancies , it will be continue to have a huge impact on the environment .
The challenge will be increase the quality of life while being environmentally sustainable .
The rising life expectancies can be considered an achievement and a challenge because it is the by-product of rising quality of life; bringing along its glory and its dirty little secrets .
At the present time , people are more concerned about their health .
There are better health care systems to let people check their physical condition regularly , and more and more people choose organic food and eat balanced diet to make them healthier .
As a result , the current average life span is over 65 worldwide now .
By projections of the United Nations , it is shown that population aged more than 60 is increasing at 2% to 3% in the developed and developing countries respectively .
The rising life expectancy is a big achievement of human beings .
However , as there are only limited space and resource on earth , rising life expectancy is also a challenge for all the people worldwide .
Rising life expectancy is a technology achievement .
Back to the ancient days , when human beings firstly appeared on the earth , the average life expectancy is only less than 20 .
The reasons are mainly due to the threat of fierce animals like tigers and lions , the lack of food , the lack of hygiene knowledge , and also very importantly , the lack of medicine .
With the development of society , of the past thousands of years , the technology is progressing and the concern for health is arising , so that higher life expectancies are achieved .
With more advanced technology in medicine area , more and more diseases can be cured so that much more death is avoided .
Since people get higher education today , increasing amounts of people switch from fast food to organic food and have a balanced diet so that their chance of getting cancer is lowered .
Such situation is a major progress from the ancient time and also a big achievement by all human beings .
However , since the space and resource on earth is very limited , higher life expectancy means more people will live on the earth at the same time and more fierce competition for food and space is unavoidable .
Since there are more people on the earth , more space is needed for people to live in , so that some farming land might be turned into buildings to accommodate more people .
However , the need for food is also increasing , so that the competition might become even more frightening .
What's worse , since people are unsatisfied with the amount of space and food they have , violence might take place more frequently .
Many violence happened in Middle East is just due to the fight for food and water resource .
With more people living on the earth , pollution might become even serious , and as a result of pollution , the supply of food and water will decrease , so that a negative loop will occur and the problem becomes even harder to solve .
In a word , the rising in life expectancy is both an achievement and a challenge for the whole human beings .
The advanced technology has helped us to live longer , but the limited resource on earth is also a big challenge .
We should do our best to cooperate with each other and live on the same earth in harmony .
With the development of the modern society , people lives longer .
Statistics shows that worldwide , the average life expectancy at birth was 66 .57 years for 2009 according to CIA World Factbook 2009 .
In the developed countries like Japan and Switzerland , the life expectancy can be as high as more than 80 .
Normally , people will regard the extended life expectation as an achievement , and usually use such data as a measure of the development of the countries .
However , as the population is ageing , the challenges such as increased medical cost and shortage of workforce are also realized .
In a nut shell , rising life expectancies can be considered both an achievement and a challenge .
Indeed , thanks to improved living standard and medical care , countless people's lives are extended .
No doubt life is the most precious treasure of human beings .
Without life , we have nothing .
In the long history of the evolution , we are always struggling for life against staving and illness .
In last two centuries , we human have made the greatest achievement in developing our society .
We are modernized and we have gained improved living standard and medical care .
We are no longer bothered by starving and common illness .
In the ancient times , the residents may only live for 30 years; but now , the life expectancy can be 80s in many countries .
With a doubled life time , humans can have change to explore the real meaning of life .
There is a Chinese saying that there is nothing more valuable than to save a man's life .
Hence , the rising life expectancies no doubt can be considered as a great achievement .
On the other hand , the aging of Population can also be a challenge to the society .
When people grow old , they will be weak and get sick easily .
That is the natural law which nobody can violate .
Hence , when the ratio of the seniors whose age is above 60 reaches some certain point , the challenge to the society cannot be neglect anymore .
First , the medical cost will rise greatly .
If the individual or family is to pay the bill , they can be bankrupted because of illness .
If the medical cost is covered by the government budget , the deficit will be a heavy burden affecting the normal operation of the government .
Second , the shortage of workforce can also endanger the development of the society .
Japan society is now facing severe ageing problem , and the path of development is seriously slowed .
There has been a report estimated that at the year 2060 , only half of the population in Japan are suitable to work .
The same situation is happening around the world .
Obviously , rising life expectancies should also be considered as a serious challenge .
To conclude , the rising life expectancies must be considered both an achievement and a challenge .
To extend our life is not only a symbol of our achievement in developing our society , but also a fulfillment of our original dream .
At the same time , we also need to consider the negative effects brought by the ageing population , and then find proper measures to counter the challenges .
As the technology increasingly advances , many of things that are regarded as impossible are turning into the 'possibles' .
From internet , email to the most powerful surveillance technology , every step is advancement to not only the society but also the world's achievements .
People's lives become from increasingly convenient to almost luxury , thanks to the implementation of increasingly technology available for the Man's life .
However , such rapid advancement technology though can be extremely useful to our daily life; it can also cause the invisible or massive threats to our peaceful livings that can be out of our imaginations and estimations .
Today , the surveillance technology has become almost manifest to wherever we go .
Take Singapore for example , these are installed from highly secured places such as Government sectors to working places , from condominiums to housing development board houses , and even from school canteens to toilets !
Even our applications in our Iphones or other smartphones , our I-pad can easily revealed our locations .
Every moves of us are being closely surveilled and followed once we stepped out of homes .
Now , surveillance technology such as RFID is even invented to track people .
I agree to a great extent that RFID technology shall not be easily available for the public and taken for granted .
On the other hand , I will also discuss the RFID shall be utilized for good purposes .
On the other hand , I think RFID can be useful when comes to appropriate handling and usage .
For example , this can be a very beneficial and useful device for police force to track crime suspects and terrorists for their movements , or contributing to more leads for solving a case .
Additionally , if appropriately used , this device can contributed to our scientific findings and research .
In this , I mean that we can input this device implant into an animal or birds species , for us to track their movements and actions relating to our human research that can bring us to a new regime .
RFID is indeed a great invention .
It can benefit our mankind if appropriately used .
However , I think such powerful device shall not be made easily available for the public or fall into the hands of 'ill-intentioned' individuals .
This will lead to more crimes and bring threats to our privacy .
The population ageing is now a heated expression in individuals' lives .
These two words can be seen from various media and assessments of this social trend are of great number .
When mentioning about the population ageing , media always consider it as a social problem .
It is deniable that population ageing can cause a lot of problems , but in the same time , it is also a symbol of improvement .
Therefore , population ageing should be considered both a challenge and an achievement .
Following are the more specific explanations .
The rising average life expectancies can surely cause some problems .
Firstly , the aging population is generally of low productivity .
It is a natural rule that when people grow older , their bodies will be less flexible and brains will operate slower , so they will contribute less to the society .
In addition , elderly people are using same or even more amount of social resource , as they need more medical support and human help caused by their weaker physical status .
Furthermore , to make livings , many senior citizens go back to work field .
It will also induce many problems .
For example , these senior citizens may do the work less efficient and which will lead to a low effective output .
To make him or her more competitive so that not be beat by the younger , old people usually accept lower compensation or bonus .
This may lead to the younger's lower employment rate and opportunities and thus they have to live with huge pressure and lower living standard to reduce the daily cost .
Besides , the elderly with less salary also have to lower their living standard; both the consequences can cause a decrease in social happiness level and drive the whole society in to a less stable situation .
There are also some older people live a rich life with their deposits and retirement compensation .
They can live a happy life , but actually to the society as a whole , it is a waste of social resource .
Also , the growing percentage of older people will cause the maintenance of many traditional thoughts and mindsets which may become a resistance of the positive social change .
Above all , the population aging will be a great challenge for the world for it drags the development of a society .
However , the growing life expectancies also mean an achievement to the human society .
Actually , living a longer life needs a lot of conditions to realize .
There are many factors which will result in the death of people , such as natural disasters , accident , diseases or suicides .
Long life span for the individual himself is a great achievement which indicates he or she is brave enough to face the life full of problems .
For the whole society , rising life expectancies are a symbol of more advances science and technology especially in the medical field , better social environment and a safer world .
Therefore , human need to appreciate the longer life span and consider it as an achievement .
Every coin has two sides .
The rising life expectancies are like a two side sword to the modern world .
It can cause many problems but it also means a lot for the human beings .
What we can do now is to try hard to solve the problems and in the same time appreciate its great meanings .
Rising Life Expectancies  , Not Only an Achievement , But Also a Challenge
According to recent research , population ageing is a global phenomenon and the current average life span is over 65 .
The rising of life expectancies is not only an achievement , but also a great challenge .
Obviously , rising of life expectancies is a mark of our achievements in terms of hospitalizing technology , insurance condition , culture development , and our social system , which shows the improvements of people's life quality .
Thanks to the development of technology and society , some deadly diseases in the past are curable now , and people are more aware of how to take care of our body .
This is the great achievement made by the generation .
At the same time , it is also a great challenge .
With the population ageing and the increasing portion of the old people , we are facing lots of problems now .
For individuals , since people's life expectancies are becoming longer , there will be more troubles for them to take care of themselves , especially for those who live alone or have diseases and are poor .
For example , it becomes hard for them to earn their livings; they may feel lonely especially if their spouses died; they may suffer from all kinds of diseases .
And they may not get as much attention from their family as before .
For families , certainly , the burden for young people is becomes heavier .
In China , lots of families only have one child .
That means when the child grows up , they need to take care of both parents .
One family at least should take care of four old people .
For a few groups of families , there are even up to eight old people since their grandparents are also live with them .
Besides financial burdens , they may also need to spend more energy to take care of them .
These may be too much for these young parents as they still need to look after their own children .
For society , when the group of old people becomes larger and less people can work for the society , this society may lack of labours .
And at the same time , these old people take up a larger portion of resource and budges of this society .
To some degree , it will delay the economic development of the world .
Besides , society needs to figure out more policies to secure old people's lives .
Also , the population ageing calls for a higher standard of medical treatment and technology , higher level of civilization of our life .
If our spiritual aspect of civilization cannot match our material aspect , old people will have a tough twilight years .
Now population aging is a trend .
It is an achievement of our society , but it is also a great challenge calling us to face the new situation .
Population ageing seems to be an achievement when it first happened .
In the old times , people could easily lose their life due to hunger , disease , government , war or something else .
After a country was just founded , some immature policy leaded to a nationwide hunger .
Millions of people could not find food to eat and ended up eating all the trees and grass which could be seen .
There was everywhere wandering people trying to find food .
Some people even eat their own dead children .
There was a saying which says that hunger can bring people back to animals .
Infectious disease is also a life killer .
Not long from now SARS , as blurry as it is , attacked people all around the world .
Since no one knew about this disease before , it spread around the whole world before human taking action .
The spreading speed was so fast that plenty of people died before knowing about it .
An atmosphere of death covered the whole world .
The expression of desperation can be seen everywhere .
The war kills a lot of people , which is not doubtful .
After going through the WW1 and WW2 , the population on the earth got much fewer .
No matter because the technology was not developed enough or because there were wars and battles one after another , people just didn't live a long life .
Hence , as technology especially in the medical field continues to get developed and updated , people don't risk their lives anymore .
People are happy to see that they can finally live a long life without sacrificing their blood in battles and with more and more perfect medical insurance .
The medical equipment and staff are getting more and more today .
Although some countries in Africa and Southeast Asia still face a lack of medical insurance , the world in all is getting better in the field .
With modern machine and growing method , human don't need to worry about the amount of food anymore .
All the achievements human make influence the lifespan of people .
That is why population ageing can be seen as an achievement .
Population ageing is not all about the good side of the society though .
As the society develops , people gradually find that population ageing brings us many problems .
With more and more people not working at all and receiving the allowance from the government , the society's balance is broken .
It is difficult to keep economy functioning well .
Times change , people change .
Many young people don't view things like their parents used to do .
Many young people choose not to have kids or have fewer kids than before .
This problem is very common in developed countries .
With more perfect system with the old and more modern equipment , population ageing always comes first .
The governments are seeking solutions to solve this problem .
For example , they encourage people to have more children by awarding them .
They pull up the age to retire .
No matter what measures they take , the population ageing still remains a serious problem and that is where the challenge lies .
RFID is used in many forms for example , transportation , homes and even offices .
Over these years , it had help humans to improve the accessibility in the forms of cards to gain access to certain places .
Other than using it on these areas , it is also been used as human implant or as a form of products .
These implants and products are also been used as surveillance tools .
For using as a surveillance tool , it could also be used in terms of surveys and statistics .
There are also medical tools that are more of implant into the human body for the basic medical research .
Moreover , the use of RFID chip in tracking clothes were also very common sight in the service industry for the huge number of clothing to be identified and tracked the location of it at any one point .
When RFID had been used in the transportation needs in the form of ez-link cards , the ability to gain faster and easier access of the transportation needs had been seen over the years .
This from also can be used as a tracking device where the places a person visited for the past few trips were all recorded by the system and the cards .
This form of tracking is not harmful and disturbing to the society as it could be used to fight crimes to maintain law and order .
As this information is been well keep by the operators where they encrypt the data and used it in the proper form .
This also prevents the chances of normal hackers to get this information that were recorded for proper usages are misused for unlawful usages .
Moreover , the use of the RFID for medical research is also been widely used in many countries .
These chips were also implanted under the human skin where it also helps to store the basic information of the person in it .
This form of tools does not harm but it helps in the ability to identify any person who is not carrying any identification when comes to emergency .
This important information may be needed to save the person life where their medical history was all recorded in the chip .
Additionally , the service industry were also using it to track its clothes that were been used by their employees .
This is a scene seen in Resort World Sentosa .
The clothes were all implanted with an RFID tracking chip for easy identification and recording of the whereabouts the clothes is at .
As their clothes were mass collected and washed by an external company , the ability to have a tracking system to know the whereabouts of their clothing helps in terms of the logistical hassle .
Therefore , the usages of RFID chips were more useful to help the human in the basic needs or task that is required .
This form of tracking were also not harmful to any person where they much of these information were all used for helping a person then disrupt the lives of human race .
Therefore I agree that the use of the RFID technology in tracking any person or product that would help the human race which also been mention above .
I think that surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) can be used to track people .
Nowadays , with the rapid development of science and technology , the emerging technologies always contribute to human beings better living conditions .
For example , the Internet has abridged the distance among people globally .
Although we have to admit some bad effect which is brought up by the new technology , still the advantages of the new technologies cannot be simply discarded .
Back to the surveillance technology , people may say it leaks their privacy or personal life .
Compared to this disadvantage , we should think about what the advantages it has make available for human beings .
It can provide a safe , convenient , identifiable environment .
Tracking people using surveillance technology can make people's life more convenient and identifiable .
Nowadays , people need to carry a lot of ID cards around to show that I am the one the same as the one on the ID cards .
If we have these technologies , it will automatically confirm people's indemnification and save the effort to carry a lot of cards .
Once people have their own identity confirmed , they can even need not to bring any money along with them .
To purchase goods , they just need to deduce money from their identity and make a transition of money to the one who is selling the goods .
Based on the identifiable environment , a lot of convention way or style of human life can be changed .
For the privacy concern , if the technology can be made to adjust to human being's feeling , it will be more welcomed .
For example , if the one who carry the identifiable sensor does not want any other to know his or her location , he or she can disable the track .
Then , you may ask , how can the police get the information ?
I think that the track can be saved in some place which is not open to public .
Once it is very severe , the records will be pop out for official use .
As you can see , there are quite a lot of advantages of using the surveillance technology to track people .
In short , it can provide a safe , convenient , identifiable environment for human beings .
Besides , we can try to reduce the bad effect cause by the new technology .
Thus , I strongly agree that surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) can be used to track people .
I do not agree with the above statement .
In my opinion , surveillance technology such as RFID should be used to track people though there do exist many problems if it prevails .
This can help to regulate people's behavior , control crime and prevent terrorism , and set up demographic data .
RFID , despite the fact that it may be considered as privacy infringement , is different from video surveillance .
Unlike video surveillance , RIFD can only reflect the location and movements of the person with tags .
Without sending back any images or sound record , RFID is more user-friendly and helps prevent user's privacy at the best it can .
Firstly , RFID is a useful tool to help to regulate human or animal behavior .
The tags can be used on those who need to be took care or the beloved ones , such as a child whose parents are always concerning about his whereabouts when parents are not together with him , or maybe a lovely dog whose owner fears to lost her .
In the first case , RFID can be used to help parents to surveillance their children so that they can make sure if they are at school or playing around at his friends' home , and this may help parents regulate their children's behavior .
Secondly , RFID can be used to control crime and prevent terrorism .
Everyday crimes are happening from time to time , and help to keep low criminal rate can be a combo of ethical , physiological and social problems .
RFID can be one of the trivial ways to help dispel criminal or terroristic thoughts .
Police can put tags on those that have potential intention to commit crime .
Thus , when a man with a 'terrorism tag' entering a junction or a plaza full of people police should notice this and observe the man's behavior as well as checking his package to prevent him from explode TNT .
Apart from preventing crime and terrorism , RFID can also be used as an evidence or alibi to help infer whether the suspect is the criminal or not .
What is more , RFID can be used to help collect demographic data .
If RFID is used on everyone and running for years , surveillance centre will have a complete set of statistic data showing the movement of people from city to city , from town to town , which city is expanding more than people thought , which city is becoming less attractive .
Statisticians can use these data to build up appropriate models to predict the future needs for each city so that local governments know where and when to build more infrastructures , what kind of infrastructures and what other development should be made .
Economics can take advantage of these figures to predict the economic trend of local as well as the whole country .
As for transportation , roads and traffic authority can easily identify where traffic jams are and advise drivers to change to suggested routes .
In all , RFID should be applied to facilitate governors to better manage the world that we are living .
It can help regulate behaviors , prevent crime and set up demographic data base for various uses .
But before the application , governments need to secure safety of RFID after implantation and make sure there will not be any ID theft .
More importantly , governments should make sure only the right people can get access to these data and they must guarantee that they will not misuse or abuse the information .
As technology becomes more advanced nowadays , people are very exposed to the various types of technology in their daily lives .
It is undeniable that technology has made ours lives and works easier and more efficient .
However , when surveillance technology starts to violet the privacy of people instead of being used in a more benefitial way towards people , it is my opinion , that , such technology should rethink its way of existence .
In fact , people are getting more exposed in public through the fast development of the virtual world-the internet .
Social networks such as facebook  ,Tiwtter and many others often reveal the true identities and some confidential information of the users without being realised .
This already raises up a problem of privacy leakage .
The surveillance technology deteriorates the problem by stalking on people's privacy openly which may arouse anger and unhappiness among people .
Such incident happened in London a few years ago , when the government installed CCTV() on several streets in order to better supervise its people to keep the social order .
This was supposed to be applauded by the public because it allowed fast searching on people who violated the law and caused harm to others .
Instead , when news of the installment of such device was released on the newspaper , it was heavily cricised by the public .
People were claiming the lost of privacy .
Government had to uninstall all the devices in the end .
From this case , we can clearly conclude that surveillance technology may be helpful in some way , however , when it touches the privacy of people themselves , it is unacceptable .
In conclusion , I think that surveilence technology should not be allowed to be used to track people .
it does not only restrict their freedom in all aspects  , but also cause leakage of personal information .
This greatly violets the rights of people .
