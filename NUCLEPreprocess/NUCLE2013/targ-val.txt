In fact , this was the major limitation of people's average life span in the past .
With advanced medical technology , not only can many diseases be cured , but also people know how to keep themselves healthy .
If a developed health care system is increasing the positive side , it would be also helpful to reduce the negative side , which includes reducing  hazards in the environment .
Health care by far is the most expensive to carry out .
If the environment is too dangerous to live in , there would not be sufficient medical resources for usage .
Such environmental hazards come from various aspects .
A major source of the hazards is  pollution .
A place with heavily polluted air and water is by no means a good habitat and will bring a lot of health problems for its residents , among which aged people and children will be harmed the most .
Only if the city is safe and comfortable can people live a longer and happier life .
If the above two aspects are described as the hardware of the system , they do require  software to function , which is  ubiquitous good will for senior citizens .
When people become old , most of them join the weak group of citizens who have to  receive care from other people .
If  society has the most advanced medical science and the best environment , but does not grant  access to them for its senior citizens , it just does not help .
And if people in society do not want to care for their elderly , nothing will be done for them .
Only when there is  ubiquitous good will for senior citizens can  aged people live well , and that is a thing to be proud of .
With the glory , there come problems .
To take care of old people , facillities such as nursing homes need to be built , which add on to the expenses of society .
An even larger share of the old people expense lies in  health care .
In addition , old people are weakened in many aspects , thus they are usually not considered as labors .
When the percentage of old people grows larger in the population , the labor are considered to become less and each labor needs to pay more for the welfare of the old people .
In summary , the rising average life span is both a challenge and an achievement because it means an increase in load and the advancement of society , including , at least ,  an advanced health care system , reduced hazards in the environment and  ubiquitous good will for senior citizens , at the same time .
"The weak is meat and the strong eat it" does not apply nowadays .
Advanced technology saves lots of lives which should never have come to this world or should pass away .
For people , this is an achievement , but for nature , it changes its rules and cycles , which is a big challenge faced by human beings .
If anyone has ever read any fiction or stories written before the 18th century , it is very hard to find any character in those stories who lived longer than 80 years old .
They may die from hunger , die from illness or just went to bed as usual but never woke again .
In China , there is a famous saying that there are things that should be celebrated , one is red and one is white .
Here , red things mean marriage and white means someone passing away .
The first time  I read this saying I was confused why someone passing away is a good thing that people should celebrate and later I was told that in past , it was hard to live longer than 60 years old and even though you are very lucky to live longer than 60 years old , you will suffer a lot from illness or  sadness for your younger relatives passing away , so people think it is worth celebrating since the old person will not suffer any longer .
It is very hard to understand such a feeling that people felt in the past .
Now , technology and science has developed at an unbelievably fast pace .
There is lots of illness that was thought incurable in the past that has vanished in the world .
Even  people with cancer , which is still hard to cure , now have more chances to survive and have a longer time to live .
Besides illness , the improvement in technology generates more food both in quantity and in quality .
At the same time , it also frees a great amount of labor .
Now people not only can have food to survive but also enjoy high-level food and even pursuing  tasty and luxury food .
It is a break-through of technology and science , and an outstanding achievement of human wisdom .
The world is always fair to us .
While we are celebrating   break-throughs on our way to Utopia , we are  facing  a new challenge .
We cannot give up what we achieved in the past and follow the natural way to die and be reborn .
Therefore , the only way available for us to destroy such a balance is accelerating the progress of development in order to increase the capacity of our planet .
With the world is becoming more and more advanced , people are leading a more and more comfortable life .
Moreover ,  life expectancy has also been raised due to the development of the economy .
However , while we are enjoying the fruits from the development of the economy , we are also facing a global problem --- population ageing .
There is no doubt that this problem has become more and more serious and has gradually influenced the tendency of the population as well as  source allocation .
Therefore ,  rising life expectancy can be considered both a challenge and an achievement .
On one side , we cannot deny that rising life expectancy is a great achievement .
The reason why  life expectancy have aroused is that we are becoming more and more clever due to  evolution , and we are becoming richer and richer due to the knowledge we have learned .
Since  we get richer , we have more money to use to live a more comfortable life .
Therefore , because of the great efforts we have made , we have been living a better life .
And that is what we are striving for .
So  rising life expectancy can be regarded as  proof of what we have made to  for ourselves .
On the other side , we have to say that the obvious problems that we are facing are also caused by rising  life expectancy .
Since  we have  better living circumstances and higher living quality , we are leading a longer life .
This seems to be  gratifying progress at the first sight .
However , during the process of  developing  our life , we decided to reduce the rapid growth of population by adopting the measure of controlling birth so that  can also be slowed down .
This also works and we have  seen the effect .
Then there comes a problem .
Because  the birth rate is reduced while the death rate is also reduced , the percentage of the elderly is increased while that of the youth is decreased .
So  population is getting more and more aged .
But the primary labor force as well as the work force is from  youth .
That is to say , the population aging has aggravated the burden of  society .
Then we can see that  rising life expectancy can also be viewed as a challenge for us to face .
Taken together , we should say that  rising  life expectancy is two-sided .
It has been shown that we are leading a better life but we are forced to face the problem of solving population aging .
However , the achievement that we have made is far more than the problems caused by the challenges .
The significance of our existence is to lead a meaningful life and combat for the development of our world .
There is no absolutely perfect way , so we have done a good job on the road .
Therefore , we need to continue  our striving as we try our best to reduce the adverse impact  .
Rising life expectancies is an achievement because it clearly demonstrates that overall quality of life is increasing in both developed and developing countries .
However , it is also a challenge because it strains both society and the environment .
It is well-known statistically that , generally , as a country develops  life expectancy increases .
This is the result of a better quality of life; which is basically sufficient food and clean water , better sanitation and advanced healthcare .
With sufficient food , children will develop properly into adults .
Better sanitation will result in fewer deaths by infection and significantly reduce the spread of diseases and viruses .
Advanced healthcare is also a major factor in prolonging an individual's existence on earth .
Examples of how advanced healthcare in the city has raised life expectancy are such as antibiotics , the cure of poliomyelitis , and better and cleaner surgical procedures .
All of these are human achievements in their own right that have resulted in rising life expectancy , and hence they also illustrate why rising lifeexpectancy can be considered an achievement .
It is remarkable that the population aged 60 and over is increasing at 2% to 3% annually in developing countries as well .
It is highly plausible that the results for the increase are the same as the developed countries .
If that is true , it means that human rights and living standards are increasing in developing countries , albeit slowly .
Fewer famines , better sanitation and more access to healthcare in developing countries will be this century's greatest achievement as a global society .
However , an aging population is taxing on a country .
Although life expectancy may increase significantly , the population's overall productivity may not increase linearly .
The elderly will end up putting a burden on the society that they have been contributing to their whole working career .
With falling birth rates , there will be fewer working adults in society to distribute the workload .
In addition , an aging population will require more healthcare and treatment because one's constitution weakens as one ages .
The challenge is how many lives can the society and community afford to sustain; and it will only become increasingly difficult to handle .
Rising lifeexpectancy is also an environmental challenge because a better quality of life requires a lot of energy .
More food , clean water , better sanitation , and healthcare consume large quantities of energy .
An example is the modern method of intense farming .
Large quantities of energy are needed for the pesticides , and to harvest and transport the food produced around the globe .
If the current quality of life is sustained or increased in order to keep increasing  life expectancy , it will  continue to have a huge impact on the environment .
The challenge will be increasing the quality of life while being environmentally sustainable .
Rising life expectancy can be considered an achievement and a challenge because it is the by-product of rising quality of life , bringing along its glory and its dirty little secrets .
At the present time , people are more concerned about their health .
There are better health care systems to let people check their physical condition regularly , and more and more people choose organic food and eat a balanced diet to make themselves healthier .
As a result , the  worldwide now .
Projections of the United Nations show that the population aged more than 60 is increasing at 2% to 3% in the developed and developing countries respectively .
Rising life expectancy is a big achievement of human beings .
However , as there are only limited space and resources on earth , rising life expectancy is also a challenge for all  people worldwide .
Rising life expectancy is a technological achievement .
Back in  ancient days when human beings first appeared on the earth , the average life expectancy was  less than 20 .
The reasons were mainly due to the threat of fierce animals like tigers and lions , the lack of food , the lack of hygiene knowledge , and also very importantly , the lack of medicine .
With the development of society over the past thousands of years ,  technology has been progressing and  concern for health is rising , so that higher life expectancy is achieved .
With more advanced technology in medicine  , more and more diseases can be cured so that much more death is avoided .
Since people get higher education today , increasing amounts of people have switched from fast food to organic food and have a balanced diet so that their chance of getting cancer is lowered .
Such a situation is  major progress from  ancient times and also a big achievement by all human beings .
However , since  space and resources on earth are very limited , higher life expectancy means more people will live on the earth at the same time and more fierce competition for food and space is unavoidable .
Since there are more people on the earth , more space is needed for people to live in , so  some farming land might be turned into buildings to accommodate more people .
However , the need for food is also increasing , so  the competition might become even more frightening .
Even worse , since people are unsatisfied with the amount of space and food they have , violence might take place more frequently .
Much violence that has happened in Middle East is just due to the fight for food and water resources .
With more people living on the earth , pollution might become even serious , and as a result of pollution , the supply of food and water will decrease , so that a negative loop will occur and the problem becomes even harder to solve .
In a word ,  rising  life expectancy is both an achievement and a challenge for  whole human beings .
Advanced technology has helped us to live longer , but the limited resources on earth is also a big challenge .
We should do our best to cooperate with each other and live on the same earth in harmony .
With the development of  modern society , people live longer .
Statistics show that worldwide , the average life expectancy at birth was 66 .57 years for 2009 according to CIA World Factbook 2009 .
In  developed countries like Japan and Switzerland ,  life expectancy can be  more than 80 .
Normally , people will regard an extended life expectancy as an achievement , and usually use such data as a measure of the development of  countries .
However , as the population is ageing ,  challenges such as increased medical cost and shortage of workers also exist .
In a nut shell , rising life expectancy can be considered both an achievement and a challenge .
Indeed , thanks to improved living standards and medical care , countless people's lives have been extended .
No doubt life is the most precious treasure of human beings .
Without life , we have nothing .
In the long history of the evolution , we are always struggling for life against starving and illness .
In last two centuries , we humans have made the greatest achievement in developing our society .
We have modernized and we have gained improved living standards and medical care .
We are no longer bothered by starving and common illness .
In  ancient times , residents may only live for 30 years; but now , the life expectancy can be into the 80s in many countries .
With a doubled life time , humans can have achance to explore the real meaning of life .
There is a Chinese saying that there is nothing more valuable than to save a man's life .
Hence ,  rising life expectancy no doubt can be considered as a great achievement .
On the other hand , the aging of thepopulation can also be a challenge to  society .
When people grow old , they will be weak and get sick easily .
This is a natural law which nobody can violate .
Hence , when the ratio of the seniors whose age is above 60 reaches some certain point , the challenge to  society cannot be neglected anymore .
First ,  medical costs will rise greatly .
If the individual or family is to pay the bill , they can be bankrupted because of illness .
If the medical cost is covered by the government budget , the deficit will be a heavy burden affecting the normal operation of the government .
Second , the shortage of workers can also endanger the development of the society .
Japanese society is now facing a severe ageing problem , and the path of development is seriously slowed .
There has been a report estimating that by the year 2060 , only half of the population in Japan will be suitable to work .
The same situation is happening around the world .
Obviously , rising life expectancy should also be considered as a serious challenge .
To conclude ,  rising life expectancy must be considered both an achievement and a challenge .
To extend our life is not only a symbol of our achievement in developing our society , but also a fulfillment of our original dream .
At the same time , we also need to consider the negative effects brought by the ageing population , and then find proper measures to counter the challenges .
As technology increasingly advances , many of things that were regarded as impossible are turning into possible .
From theInternet and email to the most powerful surveillance technology , every step is an advancement for not only society but also the world's achievements .
People's lives  from increasingly convenient to almost luxurious , thanks to the implementation of increasingly advanced technology available for man's life .
Although such rapidly advancing technology though can be extremely useful to our daily life; it can also cause invisible or massive threats to our peaceful life that can be beyond our imagination and estimation .
Today , surveillance technology has become almost manifest wherever we go .
Take Singapore for example , surveillance is installed everywhere from highly secured places such as Government sectors to working places , from condominiums to housing development board houses , and even school canteens and toilets !
Even applications in our Iphones or other smartphones , or our I-pads can easily reveal our location .
Every move  is being closely surveilled and followed once we step out of our homes .
Now , surveillance technology such as RFID has even been invented to track people .
I agree to a great extent that RFID technology should not be easily available to the public or taken for granted .
On the other hand , I will also discuss how RFID can be utilized for good purposes .
On the other hand , I think RFID can be useful with appropriate handling and usage .
For example , it can be a very beneficial and useful device for the force to track crime suspects and terrorists for their movements , or contributing to more leads for solving a case .
Additionally , if appropriately used , this device can contribute to our scientific findings and research .
In this , I mean that we can input this device into animals or birds species , to track their movements and actions  .
RFID is indeed a great invention .
It can benefit mankind if appropriately used .
However , I think such powerful devices should not be made easily available to the public or fall into the hands of 'ill-intentioned' individuals .
This will lead to more crimes and bring threats to our privacy .
Population ageing is now a heated expression in individuals' lives .
These two words can be seen in various media and assessments of this social trend are of great number .
When mentioning   population ageing , the media always considers it  a social problem .
It is deniable that population ageing can cause a lot of problems , but in the same time , it is also a symbol of improvement .
Therefore , population ageing should be considered both a challenge and an achievement .
The following paragraphs have  more specific explanations .
Rising average life expectancy can surely cause some problems .
Firstly , the aging population is generally of low productivity .
It is a natural rule that when people grow older , their bodies will be less flexible and brains will operate slower , so they will contribute less to  society .
In addition , elderly people are using the same or even more  social resources , as they need more medical support and human help caused by their weaker physical status .
Furthermore , to make livings , many senior citizens go back to work  .
It will also induce many problems .
For example , these senior citizens may do the work less efficiently  which will lead to a lower effective output .
To make him or her more competitive so that the elderly person is not beaten by the younger , old people usually accept lower compensation or bonus .
This may lead to the younger's lower employment rate and opportunities and thus they have to live with huge pressure and lower living standard to reduce  daily cost .
Besides , the elderly with less salary also have to lower their living standard; both the consequences can cause a decrease in social happiness level and drive the whole society in  a less stable situation .
There are also some older people who a rich life with their deposits and retirement compensation .
They can live a happy life , but actually to the society as a whole , it is a waste of social resources .
Also , the growing percentage of older people will cause the maintenance of many traditional thoughts and mindsets which may   resist   positive social change .
Above all ,  population aging will be a great challenge for the world for it drags the development of  society .
However ,  growing life expectancy is also an achievement to  human society .
Actually , living a longer life needs a lot of conditions to realize .
There are many factors which will result in the death of people , such as natural disasters , accident , diseases or suicides .
A long lifespan for the individual  is a great achievement which indicates he or she is brave enough to face a life full of problems .
For the whole society , rising life expectancy are a symbol of more advanced science and technology especially in the medical field , better social environment and a safer world .
Therefore , humans need to appreciate the longer lifespan and consider it as an achievement .
Every coin has two sides .
Rising life expectancy is like a two-sided sword in the modern world .
It can cause many problems but it also means a lot for the human beings .
What we can do now is to try hard to solve the problems and in the same time appreciate its great meanings .
Rising Life Expectancy: Not Only an Achievement , But Also a Challenge
According to recent research , population ageing is a global phenomenon and the current average life span is over 65 .
The rising of life expectancy is not only an achievement , but also a great challenge .
Obviously , rising  life expectancy is a mark of our achievements in terms of hospital technology , insurance condition , cultural development , and our social system , which shows the improvement of people's life quality .
Thanks to the development of technology and society , some deadly diseases in the past are curable now , and people are more aware of how to take care of our body .
This is a great achievement made by a generation .
At the same time , it is also a great challenge .
With  population ageing and the increasing portion of  old people , we are facing lots of problems now .
For individuals , since people's life expectancy are becoming longer , there will be more troubles for them to take care of themselves , especially for those who live alone or have diseases and are poor .
For example , it becomes hard for them to earn their living; they may feel lonely especially if their spouses have died; they may suffer from all kinds of diseases .
And they may not get as much attention from their family as before .
For families , certainly , the burden on young people has become heavier .
In China , lots of families only have one child .
That means when the child grows up , he or she needs to take care of both parents .
One family at least should take care of four old people .
For a few groups of families , there are even up to eight old people since their grandparents are also living with them .
Besides financial burdens , they may also need to spend more energy to take care of them .
These may be too much for these young parents as they still need to look after their own children .
For society , when the group of old people becomes larger and less people can work for the society , this society may lack of labourers .
And at the same time , these old people take up a larger portion of resources and budget of this society .
To some degree , it will delay the economic development of the world .
Besides , society needs to figure out more policies to secure old people's lives .
Also , the population ageing calls for a higher standard of medical treatment and technology and a higher level of civilization of our life .
If our spiritual aspect of civilization cannot match our material aspect , old people will have  tough twilight years .
Now population aging is a trend .
It is an achievement of our society , but it is also a great challenge calling us to face the new situation .
Population ageing deemed to be an achievement when it first happened .
In the old times , people could easily lose their life due to hunger , disease , government , war or something else .
After a country was just founded , some immature policy leaded to  nationwide hunger .
Millions of people could not find food to eat and ended up eating all the trees and grass which could be seen .
There was everywhere wandering people trying to find food .
Some people even eat their own dead children .
There was a saying which says that hunger can bring people back to animals .
Infectious disease is also a life killer .
Not long from now SARS , as blurry a memory as it is , attacked people all around the world .
Since no one knew about this disease before , it spread around the whole world before humans took action .
The spreading speed was so fast that plenty of people died before knowing about it .
An atmosphere of death covered the whole world .
The expression of desperation can be seen everywhere .
War kills a lot of people , which is not doubted .
After going through the WW1 and WW2 , the population on the earth got much fewer .
Because  technology was not developed enough or because there were wars and battles one after another , people just did not live a long life .
Hence , as technology especially in the medical field continues to get developed and updated , people do not risk their lives anymore .
People are happy to see that they can finally live a long life without sacrificing their blood in battles and with more and more perfect medical insurance .
The medical equipment and staff are getting more and more today .
Although some countries in Africa and Southeast Asia still face a lack of medical insurance , the world in all is getting better in this field .
With modern machines and growing methds , humans do not need to worry about the amount of food anymore .
All the achievements humans make influence the lifespan of people .
That is why population ageing can be seen as an achievement .
Population ageing is not all about the good side of the society though .
As  society develops , people gradually find that population ageing has brought us many problems .
With more and more people not working at all and receiving an allowance from the government ,  society's balance has been broken .
It is difficult to keep the economy functioning well .
Times change; people change .
Many young people do not view things like their parents used to do .
Many young people choose not to have kids or have fewer kids than before .
This problem is very common in developed countries .
With a more perfect system with the older and more modern equipment , population ageing always comes first .
The governments are seeking solutions to solve this problem .
For example , they encourage people to have more children by awarding them .
They pull up the age to retire .
No matter what measures they take ,  population ageing still remains a serious problem and that is where the challenge lies .
RFID is used in many forms for example , transportation , homes and even offices .
Over the years , it has helped humans to improve accessibility in the form of cards to gain access to certain places .
Other than using it in these areas , it is also been used as a human implant or as aproduct .
These implants and products have also been used as surveillance tools .
As a surveillance tool , it could also be used in terms of surveys and statistics .
There are also medical tools that are more of an implant into the human body for basic medical research .
Moreover , the use of RFID chips in tracking clothes is also very common sight in the service industry becaueof the huge number of clothing to be identified and tracked  at any one point .
As RFID has been used in  transportation  in the form of ez-link cards , the ability to gain faster and easier access of  transportation needs has been seen over the years .
This form can also be used as a tracking device because the places a person visited for the past few trips were all recorded by the system and the cards .
This form of tracking is not harmful and disturbing to  society as it could be used to fight crimes to maintain law and order .
As this information is been well-kept by the operators because they encrypt the data and use it in its proper form .
This also prevents  normal hackers from getting this information that was recorded for proper usage  for unlawful usage .
If their medical history is all recorded in the chip , the person's life may be savedMoreover , Moreover , the use of the RFID for medical research has also been widely used in many countries .
These chips were also implanted under the human skin where they also help to store the basic information of the person   .
This form of tools does not harm but it helps in the ability to identify any person who is not carrying any identification when comes to emergency .
may be  save the person's life If their medical history is all recorded in the chip .
Additionally , the service industry is also using it to track its clothes that were been used by their employees .
This is a scene seen in Resort World Sentosa .
The clothes were all implanted with an RFID tracking chip for easy identification and recording of the whereabouts the clothes is at .
As their clothes were mass collected and washed by an external company , the ability to have a tracking system to know the whereabouts of their clothing helps in terms of  logistical hassle .
Therefore , the usage of RFID chips is more useful to help the human in the basic needs or task that is required .
This form of tracking is also not harmful to any person because  much of this information is all used for helping a person then disrupt the lives of human race .
Therefore , I agree that the use of the RFID technology in tracking any person or product  would help the human race which also has been mentioned above .
I think that surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) can be used to track people .
Nowadays , with the rapid development of science and technology , emerging technologies always contribute to better living conditions for human beings .
For example , the Internet has abridged the distance among people globally .
Although we have to admit some bad effects which are brought by the new technology , still the advantages of the new technologies cannot be simply discarded .
Back to the surveillance technology , people may say it leaks their privacy or personal life .
Compared to this disadvantage , we should think about the advantages it has make available for human beings .
It can provide a safe , convenient , identifiable environment .
Tracking people using surveillance technology can make people's life more convenient and identifiable .
Nowadays , people need of carrying a lot of ID cards around to show that they are the  .
If we have this technology , it will automatically confirm people's indemnification and save the effort to carry a lot of cards .
Once people have their own identity confirmed , they do not even need to bring any money along with them .
To purchase goods , they just need to deduce money from their identity and make a transition of money to the one who is selling the goods .
Because of the identifiable environment , a lot of conventional ways or styles of human life could be changed .
If the technology can be made to adjust to human being's feelings , it would be more welcomed by those concerned about privacy .
For example , if the one who carries the identifiable sensor does not want others to know his or her location , he or she can disable the tracking .
Then , you may ask , how can the police get the information ?
I think that the tracking can be saved in some place which is not open to public .
If it is very severe , the records could be opened for official use .
As you can see , there are quite a lot of advantages of using surveillance technology to track people .
In short , it can provide a safe , convenient , identifiable environment for human beings .
Moreover , we can try to reduce the bad effects caused by the new technology .
Thus , I strongly agree that surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) can be used to track people .
I do not agree with the above statement .
In my opinion , surveillance technology such as RFID should be used to track people though there does exist many problems if it is prevalent .
It can help to regulate people's behavior , control crime and prevent terrorism , and set up demographic data .
RFID , despite the fact that it may be considered as privacy infringement , is different from video surveillance .
Unlike video surveillance , RIFD can only reflect the location and movements of the person with tags .
Without sending back any images or sound record , RFID is more user-friendly and helps prevent the user's privacy at the best it can .
Firstly , RFID is a useful tool to help to regulate human or animal behavior .
The tags can be used on those who need to be taken care of or beloved ones , such as a child whose parents are always concerned about his whereabouts when the parents are not together with him , or maybe a lovely dog whose owner fears to lose her .
In the first case , RFID can be used to help parents to surveil their children so that they can make sure if they are at school or playing around at their friends' home , and this may help parents regulate their children's behavior .
Secondly , RFID can be used to control crime and prevent terrorism .
Everyday crimes happen from time to time , and  can be a combination of ethical , physiological and social problems .
RFID can be one of the trivial ways to help dispel criminal or terorist thoughts .
Police can put tags on those that have potential to commit crimes .
Thus , when a man with a 'terrorism tag' enters a junction or a plaza full of people , police should notice this and observe the man's behavior as well as checking his package to prevent him from exploding TNT .
Apart from preventing crime and terrorism , RFID can also be used as an evidence or alibi to help infer whether the suspect is the criminal or not .
Moreover , RFID can be used to help collect demographic data .
If RFID is used on everyone and runs for years , the surveillance centre will have a complete set of statistical data showing the movement of people from city to city , and from town to town , thus showing which city is expanding more than people thought , and which city is becoming less attractive .
Statisticians can use these data to build up appropriate models to predict the future needs for each city so that local governments know where and when to build more infrastructure , what kind of infrastructure and what other developments should be made .
Economists can take advantage of these figures to predict the economic trends of the local area as well as for the whole country .
As for transportation , the roads and traffic authority can easily identify where traffic jams are and advise drivers to change to suggested routes .
In all , RFID should be applied to facilitate governments to better manage the world that we are living .
It can help regulate behaviors , prevent crime and set up demographic data for various uses .
But before the application , governments need to secure the safety of RFID after implantation and make sure there will not be any ID theft .
More importantly , governments should make sure only the right people can get access to these data and they must guarantee that they will not misuse or abuse the information .
As technology becomes more advanced nowadays , people are very exposed to the various types in their daily lives .
It is undeniable that technology has made our lives and work easier and more efficient .
However , when surveillance technology starts to violate the privacy of people instead of being used in a more beneficialway , it is my opinion that such technology should be rethought  .
In fact , people are getting more exposed in public through the fast development of the virtual world -- the Internet .
Social networks such as Facebook ,Twitter and many others often reveal the true identities and some confidential information of the users without their being realised .
This already raises up the problem of privacy leakage .
The surveillance technology deteriorates the problem by stalking  people's privacy openly which may arouse anger and unhappiness among people .
This happened in London a few years ago , when the government installed CCTV on several streets in order to better supervise its people and keep the social order .
This was supposed to be applauded by the public because it allowed fast searches for people who violated the law and caused harm to others .
Instead , when the installment of such devices was released in the newspaper , it was heavily criticised by the public .
People were claiming the loss of privacy .
The government had to uninstall all the devices in the end .
From this case , we can clearly conclude that surveillance technology may be helpful in some ways; however , when it touches the privacy of people , it is unacceptable .
In conclusion , I think that surveilence technology should not be used to track people .
It not only restricts their freedom in all aspects  , but also causes leakage of personal information .
This greatly violates the rights of people .
