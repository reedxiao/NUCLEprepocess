Geographical and transportation borders are not a problem anymore because communication and information technologies were enhanced continuously  .
Telephone may be perceived as a big innovation created ever when the first time Graham Bell introduced it  .
However  , since internet were known  , telephone started to give way to social media sites  .
Many advantages are given to the users  .
Let us take example from Facebook and Twitter  , two of the most famous social media sites  .
Through Facebook  , peope are able to maintain relationship with their old acquaintances  .
This benefit cannot be obtained through telephone or mail because people's particular and address may change from time to time while on Facebook  , people can keep in contact with old friends just by using name and photo  , for example  , as the identifier  .
Facebook is like a combination of message and chatting service  , personal profile  , media of sharing  , and other entertainment add-on (i  .e  .
social games) which allow users to communicate with remote people  , and also to update and express themselves at the same time  .
Twitter  , that has more simplified function compared to Facebook  , gives more benefit if used as information sharing media  .
Twitter only allow users to give update that is limited to short sentences in order to spread the words fast  , that only highlighted messages are delivered  .
For Facebook  , a comprehensive way of sharing is offered since multiple photos and videos can be uploaded  , long notes can be published  , even documents and data can be shared through Facebook nowadays  .
These advantages also comes in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile application in our smartphones  .
Despite the luxury that is offered by social media  , there are also harmful side effects which people may not realize it beforehand  .
Researches show that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing  .
As the consequence  , it affects their interpersonal skills  .
People can think while typing and prepare what they want to say but in face-to-face communication  , every word that comes out of your mouth and may be not well arranged is the picture of your personality  .
This skill requires practices and cannot be done completely through social media  .
There is a situation where a family is having a dinner together in a restaurant but everybody is busy with their own gadget  , posting picture in Facebook  , updating status on Twitter  , or even chatting with friends  .
These social media serves a purpose to bind people in spite of their geographical boundaries but it doesn't mean that surrounding people are neglected as the payoff  .
This is related to the interpersonal skill that is mentioned before  , that can be decreasing qualitatively if we are used to facing gadget  , not facing human being  .
Another disadvantage that affects other people is that by only showing selected part of our lives  , we build "false image" in public  .
We tend to only share our happy moments in media  .
Because of this  , other people start to think that our lives are full of happiness with no problem at all  .
Other people then are influenced by us and tend to do the same  .
As a result  , people think of theirselves lowly and may lead to depression and mental disorder  .
It also reduces our sympathy  .
This is a serious social problem and affects a lot of people  .
As explained above  , modern and sophisticated technology doesn't always give advantages  .
There are a lot of disadvantages that people may not realize of  .
It is up to people's discretion and comprehension to decide which side they want to take  .
So  , we should never forget to think of and calculate the benefit and loss of every decision that we make  .
Nowadays  , the advancement of technologies improves the life of many people a lot  .
In most of the countries  , there is an emergence of social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter  .
Many people think that the social media sites have benefits on the communication between people while some others argue that there are several negative impacts for the society  .
One of the advantages which are carried by those social media sites is that they can connect us more closely than before  .
In the past decades  , when the social media sites are not yet fully developed  , people connect with others who live far away by using a phone  , or even a letter  .
However  , calling a person by using a phone and writing a person a letter require some cost  , and sending a letter to a person who live far away  , especially in villages  , takes much time  .
The appearance of those social media sites causes those problems to be solved  .
People connecting through the social media sites can spend no money on the communication  , and also take only one or a few seconds for the message to reach  .
Therefore  , this advantage of social media sites saves money and time  , and also provides convenience for many people  .
Moreover  , this also provides an alternative way for people to contact a person whom they did not see for a very long time  , such as their friends in primary school and secondary school  .
As we graduate from a school  , we will probably lose contact with some of our friends  .
Some of them may have changed their phone numbers and addresses  , and we are not able to find them through a phone or a letter  .
If phone and letter are the only way to contact them  , we would probably not able to find them  .
Facebook and Twitter can serve as an alternative route to make connection between us and our old friends  .
Hence  , the social media sites serves as a platform for the connection  .
Everything comes with benefits will also have their disadvantages  .
On the other hand  , social media sites also bring some negative impacts for the people and the society  .
The advancement of those social media sites makes people so rely on them that some of them rather prefer using those sites to contact each other than talking to each other face to face  .
Many people argue that this is the most serious problem brought by social media sites  .
The usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life  , which will in turn cause the lost of interpersonal skills for many people  .
As we all know  , the interpersonal skills are essential for us to communicate with each other and to present our views and ideas  .
The lost of interpersonal skills results in the inability for people to well present their ideas  .
As a result  , they will gradually decrease in their ability to compete with each other in the society  .
In conclusion  , social media sites cause both positive and negative consequences for people and society  .
As a part of this modern society  , we should learn to distinguish between good and bad impacts brought by the advancement of technologies  , and also learn to avoid the cons and maximize the benefits of those sites  .
Among all kinds of different diseases  , a large amount of different kinds of disorders are caused by genetic reasons  .
Genetic disorder may or may not be hirataged hereditary disease and it is sometimes hard to find out one has these kinds of diseases  .
It is a long time discussion that whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives that his or her disease is caused by gene  .
From the legal aspect  , the answer is no but from the ethical aspect  , the answer should be yes  .
We can't make a law to push a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives about his genetic problem  .
It is immoral and impractical  .
Firstly  , someone having what kinds of disease belongs to his or her privacy  .
Privicy protection belongs to one's human rights  .
If a law requires someone to tell others' his or her privacy especially when the one is not willing to do so  .
It is againt his or her human rights and it is against the law's spirit  .
The law's spirit also include the fairness  .
What is the basic difference between genetic disorder and other disorders  .
It is unfair to release a law only point to the genetic disorder  .
In addition  , it is impractical to make such a law  .
A good law should be clear and easy to execute  .
However  , there are many problems againt the execution of asking a carrier to tell his or her ralatives the cause of his or her diseases  .
Firstly  , what is the range of the relatives  ?
For example  , does the carrier only need to tell his or her direct relatives like parents and brothers and sisters or does he also need to tell relatives like his grandmother's sister's son's daughter's nephew  ?
If you say only need to tell direct relatives  , it will be against the fairness of law  .
Other relatives may have the same possibilities to have such kind of disease  .
How can a law made by government exempt such a group of people from preparing to face their potetial disease  ?
However  , from the ethical point of view  .
To the carrier himself of herself  , he of she should have a feeling of resposiblity to tell his or her relatives their genetic disorder  .
By doing this   ,they may be able to save some lives of their relatives  .
It is because a carrier with bad gene may not necessary have those genetic disease  , if they can have coresponding healthy lifestyle before the age that the gene's function become stronger  .
A typical example is genetic caused hypertension  .
Hypertension can be caused by genetic problems which make the carrier harder to digest the fat and salt in blood which can cause hypertension  .
People usually get this kind of hypertesion after they become adult  .
However  , if they already know they have a gene that may make them have higher possibilities to get hypertention  .
They can build a daily habit to eat less salt and fat and thus to avoid hypertension  .
In a nutshell  , our society can't push genetic problem carrier to tell his or her disease to his or her relatives but he or she should be willing to tell his or her relatives about his or her genetic problem  .
By doing so   , less of his or her beloved ones will suffer from the genetic problem  .
With the advancement of technology in recent years  , the need to keep in-touch with people and latest news has become a tremendous demand  .
Some of the famous examples would be social media sites like Twitter and Facebook  .
With an increasing users of more than billion users from all over the world  , social media sites have demonstrated clearly its success in playing an important part of our life  .
However  , there are arguments that social media life brings in a reduction in face-to-face human contact  , which in turn affects interpersonal skills  .
Let's examine the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life and society  .
First and foremost  , all social media sites are free  .
All users' needs are an internet connection and an email account so that everyone can have a Facebook or Twitter ID to start their journey in social media life  .
Secondly  , it helps people to keep in-touch with one another  .
Finding old friends through Facebook  , for example  , is more easier than asking people around in real life  .
Social media helps to lessen the hassle of geographical distance and brings people closer  .
Thirdly  , social media sites keep us up-to-date on latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world  , all with a click away on the refresh button  .
Last but not least  , social media sites also link people together through allowing us to create our own groups  , pages or sites to share our hobbies  , interests and studies in particular subjects  .
Hence  , it is undeniable that these sites play an important role in our global inter-connected world  .
However  , social media sites also have its second side of negative impact on human  .
Undeniable  , it becomes more addicting when we spend more time busy socialising and interacting virtually  .
We spend majority of our time on sites like Facebook  , Twitter and it affects our daily work productivity and performance  .
In corporate world  , employers often block social media network to prevent employees to spend their office time on their personal leisure than concentrating on their work  .
Using text-messaging language as an informal way of communicating on social media network also brings in a bad impact for us in a long term  .
The more time we spend on these sites  , the lesser time we spend on face-to-face interacting with one another  .
Hence it lessens valuable interaction between human and time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone  .
In addition  , there are also some false reports and fake IDs occur on both social media sites that people use fake ID to insult or harass someone  , like the case of Heather Chua occurred recently on Facebook  .
These malicious comments often go viral and it creates a strong negative effect on the real user in real life  , which might lead to unwilling attitude to interact with others in real life by the victim  .
In conclusion  , everything has its two-sided affect and it depends on how we exploit it  .
With current booming technology  , it is agreeable that people become more technology-savvy and they want to spend more time interacting with each others through social media sites  , however  , it does not mean that we should neglect face-to-face human interaction as it plays even a more important aspect in our life  .
As more and more social websites such as Twitter   , Facebook and Weibo which have become ubiquitous  , seamless and imperative in our life  , people may worry about the young generation having problems in face-to-face communication skills  .
However  , I believe that the benefits brought by these online chatting rooms tremendously outweigh their repercussions  .
Social media enables us to explore the world far far away without paying expensive airplane tickets and sparing a one-week holiday  .
The convenience is beyond description  .
With a small smart phone or a computer at school  , at work or at home  , we can easily make friends worldwide with a 'click' and get to know about their life through having conversations with them  , reading their blogs  , photos and status  .
Compared to face-to-face interaction  , online conversation is easier for strangers to open their mouth to each other  .
Since some of the information has already been revealed on the home page  , it is also easier to find some common topics to talk about  .
Moreover  , people usually like to share boldly about their real feelings online with their masks in reality being taken off  .
This has been indicated in a report done by Boston University in 2012  , 80% of information posted online is true while a person may like 3 out of 10 times in real life  .
This shows that a facebook friend may know more about you than your close friend who does not have a facebook account  .
That is because we are acting who we are in reality while we have no reason to do that in the online virtual world  .
Although sometimes those genuine sharing of information may be inappropriate or even harmful  , such as prevalent using of vulgarity and harsh-meaning comments  , we can minimize those repercussions through strict regulations of content online  .
Another advantage of social media is in aiding the spread of democracy  .
People around the world could easily share their thoughts about their governments  .
That eliminates the incomplete information disadvantage for some remote rural regions where people are less aware of what actually is happening around them  .
One of the examples is the 2012 riots happened in Egypt and Zambia  .
The idea of searching for democracy is passed from Egyptians to people in Zambia quickly through the use of social media  .
However  , as the government controls most of the media  .
These social media may be tools of their campaign and manipulating the thoughts of the public  .
For example  , in 2012 general election is Singapore  , Dr Tan Chee Keong made use of facebook to spread his campaign videos to the public  .
Though because of this  , social media is still a much fairer and more transparent online platform for the public to share ideas compared to other traditional medias  .
Intensive use of Social media does reduce the time people spend in face-to-face communication  .
It is commonly seen in a food court or restaurant that a group of people sitting together around a table with each of them having a cell phone in their hands  .
They are too busy with their way too many virtual friends and some of them neglect the feelings of their real-life friends  .
In this case  , I have to say that to err is human  .
What we can do is to educate the public about the importance of their friends just by their side and teach them to manage their time well  .
In conclusion  , the use of social media has more advantages than disadvantages to our daily lifes  .
What we can do is to cautiously manage our time spent online and manage our words used online  .
With the regulation of government and relevant authorities  , the virtual world would be a better world  .
Social media sites' role in connecting people around the world is undeniable  .
Thank to those social media  , the communication among people all over the world is possible and can be done with ease  .
Apart from the ease of communication despite of the distance  , many other advantages such as knowledge sharing and trades can be done through social media as well  .
Nevertheless  , with those advantages  , some disadvantages may appear such as reduction in face-to-face human contact which affects interpersonal skills  , privacy issue  , as well as some frauds that can be done through social media  .
Twitter  , Facebook and Skype are some social media sites which enable us to keep in touch with our friends or family who are in other cities or countries  .
Through those sites we are able to talk to them  , to know what their activities are and who their friends are  , etc  .
From the surface point of view it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite of the distance  .
The sharing of information can be done faster through social media as well  , that is why nowadays many news publishers make their own social media account  , for example Channel News Asia has a twitter account and will update its follower with headline news  .
That shows how actually news and information can be shared easily through social media  .
Furthermore  , since many teenagers and young adults are fans of social media  , these information can reach them easily without them need to watch or listen to the news reports  .
Due to the popularity of social media  , many people start to do their business via these sites  .
More and more advertisements can be found on Facebook  , whether it is our friends who sell their products or professional brands selling their products online  , we can get to buy and contact the sellers through those sites  , which can be considered as an advantage for us  , the buyers  .
However  , is it the same when we keep in touch with someone virtually compared to when we meet them personally  ?
I do think there is difference in it and I believe many of us will agree  .
When we write or communicate virtually  , we can hide our through feelings and many not become ourselves since we do not want the other party to judge us  .
Other than that  , sometimes the message of one party cannot be delivered properly to the other one since the communication is done through written language  , and thus the 'tone' of the message sent and when it is received may be different  .
Many people are very brave in telling people about their opinions online but in real life some of them can be very shy and not outspoken at all  .
This will lead to a bad inter-personal skill as well as a problem of trusts  .
Nowadays we cannot really trust new people whom we know from social media since we will never know whether they are even 'real'  .
Some people fake their identities in media sites so that they can know more people or some may even cheat others  .
In addition  , privacy issue has become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share at the first place  .
Therefore  , while social media sites are undoubtedly have benefits in our life  , we should consider its drawbacks and thus use it wisely so that we can gain more of their benefits and it disadvantages us in the smallest way as possible  .
It is a common scene that almost everyone in a public transport is watching at phone or wearing a pair ear piece in this modern society today  .
Not only one but many developed and developing countries have the same picture  .
Some say that it is a necessary step for human revolution  .
Social media sites like Twitter and Facebook are popular among people in order for them to connect to others even from different countries  .
It also brings many negative effects such as loss of face-to-face communicating skills which is important in their working place  .
This essay will discuss about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life  .
One of the significant advantages of using a popular social media site is that people can reach other easily  , even without contact for a long time  .
In this fast pace and competitive world  , people may not able to keep in touch with others  .
With the help of social media site  , people are able to upload their new discoveries and funny scene on it and they can be updated the new information of their friends  .
Personally I am study in oversea  , busy study life keeps me away from contact my old friend  .
Using a common social media site with my friends to help me know what are their statuses nowadays  .
And I am able to easily find a common topic when I contact them  .
In Singapore  , many Malaysian cross the sea to work here  .
Many of them are busy in work and separate with their children  .
One of Manager in my working place has the same situation  .
After my Manager taught her mother how to use Facebook  , she was able to upload video clips of her grandchild  .
Therefore my Manager would not miss the moments of her daughter's growth  .
Social media sites are also a very useful tool for people to start a new friendship or relationship  .
People get connected or closer with same preferences  .
It is easier for people to approach the other after knowing the information  .
Students can exchange their experiences in study even they are in different countries  .
People are able to share the culture or pretty photos online  , therefore others can spread the joy with them  .
Thus I believe that social media sites are one of useful tool to help people known each other better  .
However  , social media site is a double-sided sword  , it also bring in some negative effect on our daily life  .
One of the disadvantage that many people concerns is that people loss the interest of face-to-face communication  .
Many people like to use language to pretend themselves  , and lost confidence when they talk to each other  .
Although not everyone is good at public relationship even without the existence of the social media sites  , we cannot deny that it do affect some people in their ability of interpersonal skills  .
In conclusion  , the shadow always exists when there is light  .
We should take the advantages of the creatures we create and try to avoid the negative effects  .
Social media sites suppose be a very useful and convenient tool to use and bring people get closer in this globalised world  .
The use of social media has largely influenced our ways in communicating with one another  .
Online friends became real life friends and real life friends communicate with one another online  .
Social media has changed our ways of exchanging information and interpersonal relationships profoundly  .
There are advantages and disadvantages in this change  .
Social media has reshaped the way of communication  .
In real life  , we communicate with one another as equal participants  .
We share ideas  , stories and forge friendship based on mutual respect  .
However  , communication on social media is largely based on "broadcasting and listening"  .
When we use facebook and post pictures and statuses  .
We are actively "presenting" façades of our lifes in front of others  .
We tend to post pictures with the best looks  , status that are funny  .
We broadcast these facades of us to others  .
The images we choose to present are tentatively considered  .
The audience is not some specific person  , but everyone we might know  , or even the entire world  .
There is an element of seeking out for attention rather than expressing one's true opinion on social networks  .
On the other hand  , the viewers  , are not the listeners  .
They are just scrolling down pages of pages of pictures and statuses and see one of them which they might think it funny  .
It is not the broadcasters themselves they care about  , but the content  .
This type of communication does not help forging interpersonal relationships  .
In real life  , establishing friendship requires the all-rounded understanding in one another and the caring for one another  .
The latter requires face to face interaction where we can show our emotions to the other  .
One cannot truly understand a person with only stalking his/her facebook page where he/she carefully chooses what to present  .
One cannot truly show their emotions by another by texting some =) signs  .
The broadcasting and viewing model is not good for forging relationships  .
However  , it is good for sharing information  .
On social media  , everyone is a broadcaster and a viewer  .
With my social network account  , I seldom read newspapers or go to news websites anymore; because I can easily read them from the status of my friends  .
If I am interested in politics  , I can just follow some politics newspapers or public figures  .
I get news for sales  , clothes and cosmetics from my friends  .
If some of my friends have horrible taste on clothes and he/she posts them often  , I can simply block him/her off  .
Information got circulated  .
The most popular information get circulated the most so I can seldom miss it  .
Social network plays a role in providing and also filtering information  .
This saves a lot of time for me in reading newspapers and watching TV  .
Personally I feel more at ease on social medias  .
From the above two points of view I think social media could forge more interest-based friendships  .
With the help of social media  , I become real life friends with those from online forums whom I share the same interest with  .
I also discover some of my friends' interest which I find common with myself so that talking to one another is much more about life  , study  , friends  , etc  .
The communication does not focus on how we feel  , or to say  , each otherm  , but whatever is interesting  , or the content  .
In this case  , interpersonal skill is not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody  , but to get the information that we are both interested in  .
In conclusion  , I think social media has reshaped interpersonal relationships from a more human-based friendship that requires sharing and caring between friends  , to a more information-based friendship that requires a mutual interest  .
There are advantages and disadvantages in itself  , however  , whether it is good or bad we are still not sure  .
It is just different  .
People that living in the modern world really cannot live without the social media sites like Twitter and Facebook  .
Almost all students and young adults possess the Facebook or Twitter account  .
It is true that social media makes people be able to connect one another more conveniently  .
However  , it seems that  , especially for some those  , sharing some parts of their lives such as videos and photos on the social media sites become really necessary  .
An extremely interesting and ironic phenomenon was discovered that a group of friends met and sat around one table  , but none of them were really chatting with one another  .
Instead  , all of them were more interested in posting pictures of this "cheerful" meeting on their social media sites  .
Therefore  , there is need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media  .
Social media enables people from different parts of the world to communicate with one another  .
People used to write letters and send post cards to keep in touch with ones live far away from them in the past  .
It can take a few days or weeks for those to receive the messages  .
Nowadays  , what people need to do is just typing in front of the computer in their own rooms  .
And people on the other side will only need a second to receive the message  .
Distance and time are no longer the problems  , which is convenient especially when instant chat is needed  .
However  , when people become more and more addicted to this convenience and fail to communicate with people who are close to them  , their face-to-face interpersonal skills are lost  .
Social media provides people a way of talking and chatting which can never be considered as a way of communication  .
When ones chat on those media sites  , there is no eye connection  , no emotion delivery and even the expressions are typed in by using some combinations of punctuations  .
For more convenience  , sentences are shortened to simply three or four words such as lol (which means laugh intensively) and "asap" (which means as soon as possible)  .
People indeed go to great length to make their words as shorter as they can  .
While  , once they are communicating with people in their face  , expressing themselves appropriately become really a big problem  .
Social media also provides people huge brunch information about people and things that they interests  .
For example  , on Twitter  , it is exciting to follow people that you adore like famous movie and series stars  , business men and entrepreneurs  .
It makes people feel extreme close to their admirers' lives and works  .
Updated news people care about can be easily obtained when you refresh your social media sites on your smart phones and laptops almost every time at any time  .
However  , after one has registered in those social media sites which are not reliable  , all the information you have filled in will be a weapon against you in the future  .
Furthermore  , not everyone on the social media sites is honest  .
The profile picture may not be the person who that user says he or she really is  .
The reason might just be that he or she just wants to "decorate" his or her face  .
But there is possibility that the person on the other side is deceiving you in order to obtain your information against you  .
No pledge of authenticity risks people's information and privacy that are shared on social media sites  .
To sum up  , social media has advantages and disadvantages in people's daily life  .
It shortens the distance between people from all over the world and makes instant communication possible  .
And it becomes more convenient to obtain and update information by using social media  .
On the contrary  , social media makes people lose their ability to communicate effectively in their real lives and makes people risk exposing their privacy to those whose identity cannot be verified on the social media sites  .
As the development of the technology  , social media becomes more and more significant role in the whole world  .
Everyone in the world cannot stop using it every day to express their feelings or ideas and a log of other stuff which helps their friends know their lives better  .
However  , it also raised the concerns about whether it brings us more benefits or a human disaster  .
Although it helps to connect us with our friends wherever we are  , it at the same time reduces the chance for us to talk to our friends face to face which may affect our interpersonal skills  .
Thus  , whether there are more advantages or disadvantages becomes a tough question for every human being  .
Many people says they will support the social media since it really helps them to have a closer view about how their friends are going in other parts of the world  .
This is especially to people who are overseas  .
To them  , social media is the only resource they can approach to know everything happened in their home country and the way they can use to show their lives to their lovers as well  .
What's more  , these days social media plays an important role in spreading the information  .
Nowadays  , people can just easily put their renting information on their facebook account and wait for the response from others who are from different parts of the world which brings us a huge amount of convenience  .
It is quite significant especially for those young teenagers since they would rather go to these sites to see the news and know what happened in this world than read the newspaper every day  .
However  , there are also a great amount of people who against this technology  .
They worry a lot about the bad effect on the teenagers who are still developing themselves  .
They pointed that actually social media reduces the chance for us to talk to people around us face to face  .
The more we care about facebook  , the less time we will have to spend with our friends  .
Nowadays  , it is quite common to see on some party  , people would more prefer looking at their phones and reading all the posts on facebook if they feel bored  .
It makes people worry since if all the teenagers continue using social media frequently  , they will decrease the ability to talk to people  .
They will feel it becomes difficult for them to find any topics to communicate with other people  .
Personally  , I strongly agree that social media brings more disadvantages compared to advantages it gives us  .
Although it is really useful when we need to use it to let other people know we really live a good life  , it wastes us a lot of time as well  .
Think in another way  , if we put those time we spend on wandering on those sites  , we may already finish one book or do other more meaningful things  .
We should keep in mind that there are still ways for us to contact with our family or friends  .
Everything will be bad if we don't know how to use them wisely no matter whether it is really good or not  .
As a result  , it is important for people to know that we need to be cautious about the time we spend on these social media  .
As stated above  , I strongly believe that if we can use social media wisely rather than abusing it  , we will all live a better life  .
Nowadays  , as the technology is becoming increasingly advanced  , more and more social media sites are showing up in our daily life  .
You can see people playing Facebook  , Twitter through their smart phones or ipad on buses or on trains  .
Some may say that the appearance for these modern media will reduce the chance for people to communicate face to face  .
This essay will illustrate the pros and cons of using social media in modern society  .
Firstly of all  , social media can make it more convenient for people to make friends and contact each other  .
Years ago when these modern products have not been popular  , the way for people to communicate or contact people far way are still restricted in making phone calls  , sending emails or writing letters  .
Some will take long time and some are not efficient enough for people to get their response  .
However  , social media solves these problems well  .
People can contact their friends on the internet and get their reply very fast  .
The communication is also not limited in words  .
People can express themselves through pictures or emotions  .
People can also get to know their friends' state and mood by looking at their posts on line  .
Moreover  , people can be aware of what is going on in social situation and see the comments online and share their opinions on these websites  .
These social media makes people's life much more colorful and provide a lot of fun  .
However  , social media may do some harm to people's life  .
It will make people spend more time on chatting on the internet rather than communicate face to face such that the interpersonal skill will be badly affected  .
Some people spend a lot of time in it and forget their real life  .
Actually  , I have seen some people are very funny and interesting when I am chatting with them online  .
However  , they behave quite boring when I talk to them in real life  .
Teenagers are developing their interpersonal skills and social skills when they are growing up  .
If they spend too much time on these social media  , it may cause some problems to their mental development  .
They may feel uncomfortable when they communicate with people face to face  .
Some may share fewer and fewer time with their family and not knowing how to express themselves  .
Moreover  , some wrong values on the websites will affect teenagers and confuse them  .
Some may even do something wrong  .
In conclusion  , the showing up of social media sites is a double edged sword  .
It can make our life simpler  .
People can promote their friendship and relationship through these social media  .
Whereas  , it can also make people forget to communicate to their family and friends in the real life and affect negatively to their interpersonal skills  .
But overall  , the advantages far outweigh its disadvantage  .
So we need to make best use of these social media and make it a fun way of adding some excitement when life is boring  .
And try to bypass the shortcomings  .
Remember to send greetings to our friends and family frequently  .
Nowadays  , with the advancement of technology  , it is easy to communicate wherever you are  .
The appearance of social media sites truly connects people closely  .
People can know their friends' recently looks and interesting things happens on that people just by checking their facebook or other social media sites  .
We cannot deny that the social media sites truly make the old friends do not lose the information and the chances to communicate with you even you are in a different country  .
However  , the social media sites truly reduce the communication in face-to-face which truly affects interpersonal skills  .
There are two advantages and two disadvantages of using the social media in people's daily life  .
Firstly  , the social media sites can connect people with their friends and parents closely  .
By typing the words and showing the pictures  , people can express their emotions that they are too shy to express  .
For example  , on mother's day  , people are shy to say "I love you" to their mothers so they can type it on his or her mother's facebook page  .
Then his or her mother will also know the emotion and feel warm  .
On the other hand  , when the teenager is studying in a foreign country  , the internet is the only way that he can communicate with their parents and friends  .
Therefore  , the social media is truly good for people  .
Secondly  , the social media sites can not only connect people with their friends closely  .
People can also know much information about the celebrity in Twitter and Facebook such as Obama  , Bill Gates and get the first-hand study materials on it  .
They can learn how these people succeed and they can also have the chance to talk with them and know these famous persons' thought by using the social media  .
On the other hand  , with the help of social media  , some homeless people or someone who need the money to cure the disease can get the help from the world quickly because once one person know the information  , his or her will share it to their "friends area"  , then many people will know it and spread the information to the person who can give help  .
On the other hand  , there are also problems with the population of the social media  .
Firstly  , when people rely on the social media to communicate with their friends and parents  , they will accustom to communicate by typing and not talking  .
People even prefer talk to their friends and meet their friends online and gradually reject face-to-face communication  .
Therefore  , the social media truly limit the interpersonal skills such that people lose the chance and the ability to practice talking and connect the relation between him and their friends  .
Secondly  , without the truly communication in the real life  , people lose the ability to see the truth and false  .
There are many people in the social media with beautiful image and good content in their pages  , however in real life  , he or she may do not have jobs or live poorly  .
Teenagers may believe these people and easily be cheat and lose money even their safe  .
Therefore  , the social media is not safe which is bad to teenager's future development  .
All in all  , the appearance of social media truly helps people a lot in many areas  .
However  , there exits some disadvantages which will affect people in some degree  .
Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Social Media in Our Daily life and Society  .
Nowadays  , with the development of technology and society  , social media become more popular and even important in our daily life  .
We communicate with others using social media  , such as twitter  , facebook and microblog more and more frequently  .
There is no need to for people to go out of their home to interact with others  , they chat online  , share pictures  , tell others what they have done or funny stories  .
It seems that people build a good relationship with others by the social media  , but the problems come out  .
Pepope do not know how to talk with others face to face  , especially the strangers  .
Then  , we need to talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in your daily life and society  .
As for the advantages  , there are two aspects: more convenient to contact others  , easier to know about others  .
One advantage is that it is more convenience to contact others by social media  .
In old days  , if one wants to tell some important news to another one  , which lives far away  , he needs to write letters and it wastes time  .
The long distance and time-consuming make spreading the messages very difficult at that time  .
Therefore  , people may not contact with the faraway friends and relatives unless there are something important  .
However  , people now can contact with anyone all over the world who can use computer at any time  , and there is no time delay of messages  .
The other advantage is that it is easier to know about others by social media  .
If there is no social media  , it is difficult for people to know about a stranger  .
They may collect information about that person by asking his friends  , colleagues or family members  .
And the information collected may not be intact and true  .
Unlike today  , with the help with social media  , people can easily get the information they want just by searching on line  , and know about what that person did everyday at what time  .
As for the disadvantages of social media in our daily life  , wasting time  , causing illness related to sitting long time before the computer  , quick-spread of rumor and fake news  , most importantly  , making people lost the ability to talk to others face to face confidently  .
It is weird that people sit around the table but all face to their phones and do not talk with each other  .
If there is a joke on their facebook page  , they may talk to others in this way  , "hi  , look  , how ridiculous this is"  , then they laugh together  .
No matter it is a party  , dinner or just simply get-together  , there always are some people bow their head and playing their phones even their family and friends are in front of them  .
In a conclusion  , there are both advantages and disadvantages of using social media in daily life  .
People should enjoy the advantages of social media while be aware of the disadvantages of that and try their best to avoid the disadvantages happen to them and their friends and family  .
In the age of rapid technological advancement  , a lot of medical breakthroughs are made possible  .
Genetic testing is made possible and available for one's decision to undergo  .
It is able to detect the illnesses or diseases and even a child's parentage  .
However  , it will become a controversial issue as it becomes a dilemma for a carrier of a known genetic risk to inform his or her relatives  .
If the knowledge of the genetic risk was to be shared within the family or relatives  , there might have chances for them to have it in their blood  , which they may do necessary precautions to prevent  .
But  , if it is a terminal disease as a genetic disease  , most of the relatives will be disheartened upon having the knowledge about it  .
Therefore  , some carriers will have the opinion of keeping it as a secret  .
This essay will discuss about whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives or not  .
Some said that the genetic risk that is found in a person should be kept secret because it is considered as a personal information which should be kept confidential  .
Most patients will be depressed after realising his or her conditions  .
If one has a genetic disease after the test  , he or she might not wish to inform the relatives as he might ended up dishearten his extended family  .
Some will wish to keep it to themselves and hope to ensure that they will not bring in any pessimism into their family  .
Furthermore  , some will wish not to become a burden of anyone as seeking medical attention is relatively costly  .
Hence  , some seen it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease in confidential  .
