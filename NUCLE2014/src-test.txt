On the other hand  , others may think that it will be considerate to tell the relatives because the latter will have a higher tendency of getting the same genetic risk  .
Hence  , they will be able to seek help from medical specialists to find a cure or to do some measures to prevent the risk of getting the disease  .
Nevertheless  , it will depend on what kind of genetic diseases  , given in the context of current medical technology  .
For example  , breast cancer is a genetic disease and it can be cured if it is being realised in the early stage  .
Hence  , with the knowledge of having genetic risk  , the relatives of this genetic disease will do a medical check-up  , which might save them in realising it at a earlier stage  .
In conclusion  , it will be considerate to inform the risk of getting the same genetic disease to the relatives  .
Although there might be a lot of challenges along the way in seeking medical attention  , such as financial issue  , everyone should be given the rights of knowing their family's inherented medical conditions  .
However  , some think that it might be better for those who are ignorant about it and will continue leading a happy life  .
In addition  , some may think that even knowing about having genetic risk of the disease  , it will just adding on to their misery as there is nothing that they can do about it  .
All-in-all  , it depends on individual and also the nature of the disease  , but he or she should be obligated to inform the relatives if there are possibilities in curing or preventing it  .
Today world is considered to be the era of social media sites like Facebook and Twitter which are attractively connecting people around the world  .
However  , some people worry that social network can affect interpersonal skills as it reduces face-to-face human contact  .
The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in the society are elaborated on as follows  .
Nobody can deny social media's advantages as the benefit it provides in connecting people regardless of nationalities  , races  , cultures and languages  .
Social media is a trending channel and a suitable mean of communications  .
Firstly  , social media brings convenience to the world  .
It has erased the boundaries of distance and time  .
No more worries about the time it takes to deliver letters and packages  .
Nowadays  , thanks to the help of social media  , with just one click  , you can contact your family and friends wherever you want  .
You can share photos  , videos and every meaningful experiences of your life  .
More importantly  , it is cheap and easy to use social media  .
Secondly  , social media network opens the door of opportunities for people due to its great benefit in connecting  .
A lot of fresh graduates can find jobs thanks to Facebook and Twitter  .
Young people can widen their relationships  , meet new friends and learn wonderful things in many parts of the world  .
In business area  , social media is a good tool to develop and advertise products and services  .
On the other hand  , social media also has disadvantages which have created worries to the society recently and made it a controversial phenomenon  .
More and more young people tend to live in social media world most of their time and reduce face-to-face human contact  , which can affect interpersonal skills and relationships in social life  .
First and foremost  , we should realize that social media world is not trustworthy and real  .
Everyone can easily make up the personality and characteristics they want  .
They can become anyone  .
Though social media do create relationships  , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction  .
There is a story of a girl who lives in social media world every night in eight years  .
In the chat room  , she created a close relationship with eight people  .
She talked with them every night  , trust them and share her life with them  .
Then eventually  , she discovered that eight people became one as he was using eight different identities to chat with her all the time  .
Furthermore  , the convenience of social media is also its weakness  .
A lot of people use their true information on social media sites  , which can lead to crimes and deception  .
People can use the information to deceive family and friends and banks to do bad things such as blackmail  , ATM theft and so on  .
Last but not least  , social media does affect human interpersonal skills when people increase the time on social sites and reject chances to expose to social daily life activities as well as interacting with people  .
Recent research has shown that the more people spend time on social media sites  , the less they become ambitious  .
As a result  , if the situation keep go on in this unexpected trend  , it will cause a bad effect on the young generation  .
To put it in the nutshell  , everything has its own pros and cons  .
So does social media network  .
It not only is convenient and beneficial in connecting people and developing the business but it also can damage people relationships and interpersonal skills  .
Social media is only beneficial as long as we know how to use it in a correct and suitable way with the combination of both social media sites and daily life interaction to develop people's potentials to the fullest  .
Genectic testing is a personal decision  , with the kowledge that there is a possiblity that one could be a carrier or not  .
Those who are born into a family with a history of genetic disease should be allowed to undergo genetic testing  , even though if there is no risk at all  .
Early pre-examination is healthy as it will cast away unwanted doubts and affect the psychological thoughts of those who are affected  .
For a genetic risk carrier  , there should be choice given with regards to informing his/her relatives  .
There should not be forced or obligied to do so  , as it may negatively and drastically affect the emotions of the genetic risk carrier  .
With regard to this choice given  , there must be some rules to regulate and exercise personal freedom of decision making  .
If the genetic risk carrier is a minor or a child  , then most likely the decision of informing the relative should be made with the consideration of the patients parents or legal guardian  .
Such patients are still emotionally volatile or they may be unaware of the consequences of such genetic disorder due to their young age  .
Furthermore the act of informing others without the consent from their parents or the patients itself could harm the psychological state of the affected family  .
Thus  , much thought need to put on the immediate family as it could caused a stir of unwanted events from the patient or the family members itself  .
Some family may feel hurt   , with regards to their family pride or reputation  , on having the knowledge of such genetic disorder running in their family  .
However  , there is a role and a sense of responsibility to inform their relatives since it is a genetic disorder  .
There might be a possibility that the genetic disorder could also affect their relatives and any other families within the same family tree  .
The importance of informing relatives of such genetic disease is vital as it may help to raise awareness and prevention towards the genetic disorder  .
Also  , this known information will help their relatives to make informed decisions and tosimilarly undergo genetic testingto find out about the outcome  .
Thus  , having the knowledge that such genetic disorder is benign would be beneficial towards their emotinal thoughts  .
And if the results turn out to be otherwise  , then the family can be prepared emotionally and psychologically of the future outcome and aid them in making upcoming decisions  .
In addition  , the genetic risk carrier would be showered with moral and emotional support from their relatives if it is been made known to them  .
Having support from relatives are vital as they ensure the genetic risk carrier that he/she is not alone in facing this illness and it will certainly provide a morale boost as the whole family will share a common sentiment with regards towards the future prospect of the genetic disorder which could be inherited by anyone in the family  .
Therefore  , the decision to inform relatives of such genetic disorder will be dependent of the situation and backgroung of the affected family  , with the liberty of choice given to them in making the decision of informing others  .
A person with a disorder  , regardless of mental or physical disorder  , is always easy to be awared by his or her families  .
When things come to genetic issues  , it is not that simple anymore  .
Genetic disorder inheritance is generation by generation  , but not all of the offsprings show the relevant symptoms  .
Sometimes a family with potential genetic disorder risk may not be able to detect the potential harm inside their bodies as none of their members reflect any observable disorder symptoms  .
As a result  , in the case that when one of the members happen to feel uncomfortable or unnormal  , he or she should aware that whether the disorder in his or her body is a genetic risk or not  .
Afterward  , the carrier will face a serious ethical issue  , which is to reveal the problem to his or her relatives or not  .
If the disorder symptoms reflect on a kid  , the parent will be informed by the medics for sure  , then the whole family will stay alert to their bodies' condition  .
On contrary  , if the carrier is an adult  , who has his own choice to choose whether to inform his or her relatives about the risk  , that will be more complex  .
One may think that if the carrier is a caring person who loves his or her family more than himself  , there is no doubt that he or she will tell his or her family about the issue  .
That is true and of course it is the obligation of a family member to protect and take care of the family  .
Think of the other way  , if a child of the family knows that he has the risk to become a genetic risk carrier  , and the risk might as well inherit to his child in the future  , his whole life will be in a dilenma  .
And of course  , he or she will think of not having any child after getting married  , and the same thought goes to the cousins as well  .
As a result  , the family generation stops by the moment the adult carrier announces his issue  .
In China  , the older generation with traditional culture background  , will always think of having more children as well as grandchildren  , to make the family liven up and stronger  .
The reason behind is that after WOWII the population of China decreased dramatically and so the government encourage the people to give more birth  .
During that period  , if one of the family member reflects genetic disorder symptoms  , he will fell in an ethical dilenma for sure  .
The medical treatment technology during that time is not advanced enough to completely cure him  .
He has to choose whether to protect his family or make his family more prosperity with a potential generic risk  .
And so  , he would have chosen not to undergo generic disorder testing and let the truth be mined forever  .
This kind of ethical issue cannot be judged by the others because they will not understand the position and duty of the carrier in the family  .
In conclude  , people should think carefully of what is the consequences of telling the relatives his or her generic disorder issue  .
It is an obligation for a carrier to inform his relatives  , but also an obligation for a family member to liven up the family  .
Regardlessly  , if the disorder is rarely to be fatal  , or it does not caused any inconvenience to the carrier  , revealing the truth is always the right thing to do  .
In my opinion  , the carrier should tell his or her relatives about it  .
One of the reasons why is because as a carrier  , she or he needs a mental support to go through with this situation  .
It will be hard for an individual to deal with the issue on its own  .
By telling to his or her family other than being a support  , they could possibly help her to get alternative solutions to the problem that she is facing right now  .
Other than that  , I believe that the stong bond we have with our family is the biggest pillar of support to the carrier  .
Furthermore  , as it is a genetic problem  , it will be better for the carrier to inform his or her family as other family member might experience the same thing  .
By making sure that they are aware of this genetic problem  , they could have a full check-up for themselves and it will be better if they could even prevent it from happening to themselves  .
I find that it is important to inform especially if it is contagious  , the carrier could prevent the disease from spreading out to the society  .
For every action there is always pros and cons  .
I believe that some of the carriers will choose to not reveal their disease to the family members as they do not want to make their family members worry and feel uncomfortable or even feel ostracized by them  .
Furthermore  , as it could incur spending a lots of money for the treatment  , the carrier might not want to be the burden in her family  .
I could understand the feeling of the carrier  .
She or he does not want to be the source of unhappiness in thefamily  .
However  , we will never know whether this negative effects will happen when the carrier decide to tell his or her family of the his or her condition  .
In conclusion  , personally I feel that it is better for the carrier to inform her family members about the issue  .
The carrier should be honest with his or her feeling and I find that it is the right of the family member to know what is going on to his or her life  .
If anything wrong happened to the carrier's life  , without informing the family members it could make a huge regret in their life if she leaves without them knowing about it  .
On top of that  , it is better to think about solutions for her problem with the family members as there are more heads to think about it rather than thinking about it alone and struggling on your own  .
In the end  , I believe that the support in terms of mental or even monetary from your family could help the carrier to fight against the genetic disease  .
True enough that there are lots of cancer's patient who were given second choice to live as a normal person as they have a strong mental support from their loved one  .
In my opinion  , as long as we keep our mind healthy and strong  , we can fight any disease as they come to us when we are fragile and weak  .
As the techonology has been advancing  , it has reached a stage whereby the advancement triggers some ethical dilemmas in relation to the acutual use of the techonology  .
Genetic testing has been made possible- it has become easy to tell if one is a carrier of a known genetic risk through genetic testing  .
If used for a good purpose  , it can prevent unnecessary unhappiness  , however  , it could also make situation worse by revealing who the carrier is  , in the family  .
The question given is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives and I think that the carrier should not be obligated to do so because I belive that he or she has right not to know  .
Firstly  , genetic testing is not something that is compulsory  .
Of course  , some people may do it to make their futures slightly happier  , however  , the carrier  , before the testing  , can choose not to go for the test and simply live with unknowns and accept the facts  .
If he chooses to live in the uncertainty that the gene holds and willing to accept it  , he could do that  , and it has been something that is 'normal' to everyone in the past as gentic testing was not possible  .
It could rather be better for him or her this way  .
Some people might say that it is a form of prevention of giving birth to disabled lives and making them suffer in real-life  .
I personally think this ist he right purpose of going through the genetic testing  , so that a family who cannot afford to have a disabled kid do not have to give birth to their child and make the entire family suffer  .
However  , I belive that the carrier has right not to obligate to tell anyone but has responsibility to take an action to prevent any ethical dilemma  .
If the result turned out something that the carrier cannot accept then it would have been better not knowing the truth  .
I belive that even the carrier has the right not to know the true fact  .
After realizing the he or she is tshe carrier  , the emotional damage would be hard to bear  .
It could possibly causes a problem in a family due to the fact and creates more unhappiness int the family  .
Overall  , I belive that it entirely depends on the carrier to share the hard facts and face it with relatives but he has no obligation to tell still  .
In fact  , I strongly think that the carrier should weigh both the positive and negative consequences of taking the genetic testing and tak an appropriate action to the results  .
The emotional depression that the carrier might get and the sense of guilty can be more than expected and could be a burden in mind for the rest of the life  .
On the other hand  , without knowing any genetic disorder and accepting the fact  , the family will stay positive and work together to overcome the diability  .
I think the family will stay mentally healty as it is  , without having emtional stress  .
