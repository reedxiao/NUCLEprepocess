Although there might be a lot of challenges along the way in seeking medical attention , such as financial issues , everyone should be given the right  to know their family's inherited medical conditions .
However , some think that it might be better for those who are ignorant of it because they will continue leading a happy life .
In addition , some may think that even knowing about having a risk of a disease will just add to their misery as there is nothing that they can do about the condition .
All-in-all , it depends on the individual and also the nature of the disease , but he or she should be obligated to inform their relatives if there are possibilities of curing or preventing it .
Today  is considered to be the era of social media sites like Facebook and Twitter , which are attractively connecting people around the world .
However , some people worry that social networking can affect interpersonal skills as it reduces face-to-face human contact .
The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in  society are elaborated on as follows .
Nobody can deny social media's advantages in view of the benefit they provide in connecting people regardless of nationalities , races , cultures and languages .
Social media are a trending channel and a suitable means of communication .
Firstly , social media bring convenience to the world .
They have erased the boundaries of distance and time .
No more worries about the time it takes to deliver letters and packages .
Nowadays , thanks to  social media , with just one click , you can contact your family and friends wherever you want .
You can share photos , videos and every meaningful experience of your life .
More importantly , it is cheap and easy to use social media .
Secondly , a social media network opens the door of opportunities for people due to its great benefit ofconnecting people .
A lot of fresh graduates can find jobs thanks to Facebook and Twitter .
Young people can widen their relationships , meet new friends and learn wonderful things in many parts of the world .
In business  , social media are a good tool to develop and advertise products and services .
On the other hand , social media also have disadvantages which have created worries for  society recently and made it a controversial phenomenon .
More and more young people tend to live in the social media world most of the time and reduce face-to-face human contact , which can affect interpersonal skills and relationships in social life .
First and foremost , we should realize that the the social media world is not trustworthy and real .
Everyone can easily make up the personality and characteristics they want .
They can become anyone .
Though social media do create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication through face-to-face interaction .
There is a story of a girl who lived in social media world every night for eight years .
In the chat room , she created a close relationship with eight people .
She talked with them every night , trusted them and shared her life with them .
Then eventually , she discovered that those eight people became one as he was using eight different identities to chat with her all the time .
Furthermore , the convenience of social media is also its weakness .
A lot of people use their true information on social media sites , which can lead to crimes and deception .
People can use the information to deceive family and friends and banks to do bad things such as blackmail , ATM theft and so on .
Last but not least , social media do affect human interpersonal skills when people increase the time on social sites and reject chances to expose themselves to social daily life activities as well as interacting with people .
Recent research has shown that the more people spend time on social media sites , the less they become ambitious .
As a result , if the situation keeps go on  this unexpected trend , it will cause a bad effect on the younger generation .
Genectic testing is a personal decision , made with the knowledge that there is a possiblity that one could be a carrier or not .
Those who are born into a family with a history of genetic disease should be allowed to undergo genetic testing , even  if there is no risk at all .
Early pre-examination is healthy as it will cast away unwanted doubts and affect the psychological thoughts of those who are affected .
For a genetic risk carrier , there should be a choice given with regards to informing his/her relatives .
They should not be forced or obliged to do so , as it may negatively and drastically affect the emotions of the genetic risk carrier .
With regard to this choice  , there must be some rules to regulate and exercise personal freedom of decision making .
If the genetic risk carrier is a minor , then most likely the decision about informing the relatives should be made by the patient's parents or legal guardian .
Such patients are still emotionally volatile or they may be unaware of the consequences of the genetic disorder due to their young age .
Furthermore , the act of informing others without the consent of their parents or the patients themselves could harm the psychological state of the affected family .
Thus , much thought needs to be put into the immediate family , as it could cause a stir of unwanted events for the patient or the family members themselves .
Some family may feel hurt  with regards to their family pride or reputation on having the knowledge of a genetic disorder running in their family .
However , there is a  and a sense of responsibility to inform their relatives since it is a genetic disorder .
There might be a possibility that the genetic disorder could also affect their relatives and any other families within the same family tree .
The importance about informing relatives of a genetic disease is vital as it may help to raise awareness and prevention of the genetic disorder .
Also , this  information will help their relatives to make informed decisions and to similarly undergo genetic testing to find out about the outcome .
Thus , having the knowledge that the genetic disorder is benign would be beneficial to their emotional thoughts .
And if the results turn out to be otherwise , then the family can be prepared emotionally and psychologically for the future outcome and this will aid them in making upcoming decisions .
In addition , the genetic risk carrier would be showered with moral and emotional support from their relatives if it has been made known to them .
Having support from relatives is vital as they ensure the genetic risk carrier that he/she is not alone in facing this illness , and it will certainly provide a morale boost , as the whole family will share a common sentiment with regards to the future prospect of the genetic disorder , which could be inherited by anyone in the family .
Therefore , the decision to inform relatives of a genetic disorder will be dependent on the situation and background of the affected family , with the liberty of choice given to them in making the decision of informing others .
A person with a disorder , whether it be a mental or physical disorder , is always  by his or her family .
When things comes to genetic issues , it is not that simple anymore .
Genetic disorder  , but not all of the offspring show the relevant symptoms .
Sometimes a family with a risk of potential genetic disorder may not be able to detect the potential harm inside their bodies as none of their members reflect any observable  symptoms .
As a result ,  when one of the members happens to feel uncomfortable or unnormal , he or she should be aware of whether the disorder in his or her body is a genetic risk or not .
Afterwards , the carrier will face a serious ethical issue , which is whether to reveal the problem to his or her relatives or not .
If the disorder symptoms reflect by a child , the parent will be informed by the medics  , then the whole family will stay alert to their bodies' condition .
On contrary , if the carrier is an adult who has their own choice to choose whether to inform their relatives about the risk , that will be more complex .
One might think that if the carrier is a caring person who loves their family more than themself , there is no doubt that they will tell their family about the issue .
That is true and , of course , it is the obligation of a family member to protect and take care in the family .
Conversely , if a child of the family knows that he has the risk of becoming a genetic risk carrier , and the risk might as well be inherited by his child in the future , he will be in a dilemma his whole life .
And of course , he or she will think of not having any children after getting married , and the same thought goes to the cousins as well .
As a result , the family generation stops  the moment the adult carrier announces his issue .
In China , the older generation with a traditional cultural background will always think of having more children as well as grandchildren , to make the family liven up and stronger .
The reason behind this is that after WWII the population of China decreased dramatically and so the government encouraged the people to have more children .
During that period , if one of the family members reflects genetic disorder symptoms , he would fell in an ethical dilemma for sure .
The medical  technology during that time was not advanced enough to completely cure him .
He had to choose whether to protect his family or make his family more prosperous with a potential genetic risk .
And so , he would have chosen not to undergo genetic disorder testing and to let the truth be mined forever .
This kind of ethical issue cannot be judged by  others because they will not understand the position and duty of the carrier in the family .
In conclusion , people should think carefully about what the consequences are of telling the relatives about their genetic disorder  .
It is an obligation for a carrier to inform his relatives , but also an obligation for a family member to liven up the family .
Regardlessly if the disorder is rarely  fatal or it does not cause any inconvenience to the carrier , revealing the truth is always the right thing to do .
For every action there are always pros and cons .
I believe that some  carriers will choose not to reveal their disease to  family members , as they do not want to make their family members worry and feel uncomfortable or even to feel ostracized by them .
Furthermore , as it could incur spending  lots of money on the treatment , the carrier might not want to be a burden to their family .
I can understand the feelings of the carrier .
She or he does not want to be the source of unhappiness in the family .
However , we will never know whether these negative effects will happen when the carrier decides to tell his or her family about his or her condition .
In conclusion , personally , I feel that it is better for the carrier to inform their family members about the issue .
The carrier should be honest about his or her feelings  , and I find that it is the right of the family members to know what is going on in his or her life .
If anything wrong happens in the carrier's lifewithout their having informed the family members , it could make a huge regret in their life if they leave without them knowing about it .
On top of that , it is better to think about solutions to their problem with the family members ,  as there are more heads to think about it rather than thinking about it alone and struggling on their own .
In the end , I believe that  support ,whether mental or even monetary  , from their family could help the carrier to fight against the genetic disease .
There are lots of cancer patients who were given a second choice to live as  normal people because they had  strong mental support from their loved ones .
In my opinion , as long as we keep our mind healthy and strong , we can fight any disease , because they come to us when we are fragile and weak .
Some people might say that it is a form of prevention against giving birth to disabled lives and making them suffer in real life .
I personally think this is the right purpose of going through  genetic testing , so that a family who cannot afford to have a disabled child do not have to give birth to their child and make the entire family suffer .
However , I believe that the carrier has the right not to be obligated to tell anyone , but has a responsibility to take  action to prevent any ethical dilemma .
If the result turns out to be something that the carrier cannot accept , then it would have been better not to know the truth .
I believe that even the carrier has the right not to know the  facts .
After he or she realizesthat he or she is the carrier , the emotional damage would be hard to bear .
It could possibly cause a problem in a family  and cause more unhappiness in the family .
Overall , I believe that it entirely depends on the carrier whether to share the hard facts and face it with relatives , but he has no obligation to tell  .
In fact , I strongly think that the carrier should weigh both the positive and negative consequences of taking  genetic testing and take the appropriate action based on the results .
The depression that the carrier might get and the sense of guiltcould be more than expected and could be a burden  for the rest of their life .
On the other hand , without knowing about any genetic disorder and accepting the fact , the family will stay positive and work together to overcome the disability .
I think the family will stay mentally healthy as it is , without having emotional stress .
