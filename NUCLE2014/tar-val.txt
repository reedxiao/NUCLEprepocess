Since we can see both advantages and disadvantages of using social media  , and we cannot deny the huge benefits that have been brought to us  , this main trend of using social media may still last for a long time  .
Therefore  , everytime when we use social media  , we should take both sides into consideration and try to avoid being affected by the disadvantages  .
Only by absorbing the essence and discarding the dregs can we make better use of  social media  .
In a sophisticated era like these days  , experts keep producing inventions that are meant to make life easier  .
Geographical and transportation borders are not a problem anymore because communication and information technologies have been continuously enhanced  .
The telephone may have been perceived as the biggest innovation created ever  the first time Graham Bell introduced it  .
However  , since the internet was known  , the telephone started to give way to social media sites  .
Many advantages are given to the users  .
Let us take the example of Facebook and Twitter  , two of the most famous social media sites  .
Through Facebook  , people are able to maintain relationships with their old acquaintances  .
This benefit cannot be obtained by telephone or mail because people's particular and address may change from time to time  , while on Facebook  , people can keep in contact with old friends just by using name and photo  , for example  , as the identifier  .
Facebook is like a combination of message and chatting service  , personal profile  , media of sharing  , and other entertainment add-ons (i  .e  .
social games) which allow users to communicate with people who are far away  , and also to update and express themselves at the same time  .
Twitter  , which has a more simplified function compared to Facebook  , gives more benefit if used as an information sharing medium  .
Twitter only allows users to give an update that is limited to short sentences in order to spread the words fast  ,  messages are delivered  .
With Facebook  , a comprehensive way of sharing is offered  , since multiple photos and videos can be uploaded  , long notes can be published  , and even documents and data can be shared through Facebook nowadays  .
These advantages also come in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile applications on our smartphones  .
Despite the luxury that is offered by social media  , there are also harmful side effects which people may not realize  beforehand  .
Research shows that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing  .
As a consequence  , this affects their interpersonal skills  .
People can think while typing and prepare what they want to say  , but in face-to-face communication  , every word that comes out of your mouth and may not be well arranged is a picture of your personality  .
This skill requires practice and cannot be done completely through social media  .
There is a situation where a family is having  dinner together in a restaurant but everybody is busy with their own gadget  , posting pictures on Facebook  , updating their status on Twitter  , or even chatting with friends  .
These social media serve the purpose of bind people in spite of their geographical boundaries  , but that shouldn't mean that surrounding people are neglected as a payoff  .
This is related to the interpersonal skill that is mentioned before  , that can decrease qualitatively if we are used to facing a gadget  , rather than facing a human being  .
Another disadvantage that affects other people is that by only showing selected parts of our lives  , we build a "false image" in public  .
We tend to only share our happy moments on social media  .
Because of this  , other people start to think that our lives are full of happiness with no problems at all  .
Other people then are influenced by us and tend to do the same  .
As a result  , people think of theirselves lowly and this may lead to depression and mental disorder  .
It also reduces our sympathy  .
This is a serious social problem and affects a lot of people  .
As explained above  , modern and sophisticated technology doesn't always give advantages  .
There are a lot of disadvantages that people may not realize of  .
It is up to people's discretion and comprehension to decide which side they want to take  .
So  , we should never forget to think about and calculate the benefit and loss of every decision that we make  .
Nowadays  , the advancement of technologies greatly improves the lives of many people  .
In most  countries  , there is an emergence of social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter  .
Many people think that the social media sites have benefits for the communication between people  , while some others argue that there are several negative impacts for  society  .
One of the advantages which are carried by those social media sites is that they can connect us more closely than before  .
In the past   , when the social media sites were not yet fully developed  , people connected with others who lived far away by using a phone  , or even a letter  .
However  , calling a person by using a phone and writing a person a letter require some cost  , and sending a letter to a person who lives far away  , especially in villages  , takes much time  .
The appearance of those social media sites has caused those problems to be solved  .
People connecting through the social media sites  spend no money on  communication  , and it also takes only one or a few seconds for the message to reach  .
Therefore  , this advantage of social media sites saves money and time  , and also provides convenience for many people  .
Moreover  , this also provides an alternative way for people to contact a person whom they have not seen for a very long time  , such as their friends from primary school and secondary school  .
As we graduate from a school  , we will probably lose contact with some of our friends  .
Some of them may have changed their phone numbers and addresses  , and we are not be able to find them through a phone or a letter  .
If phone and letter were the only way to contact them  , we would probably not able to find them  .
Facebook and Twitter can serve as an alternative route to making a connection between us and our old friends  .
Hence  , the social media sites serve as a platform for  connection  .
Everything that comes with benefits will also have its disadvantages  .
On the other hand  , social media sites also bring some negative impacts for  people and  society  .
The advancement of those social media sites makes people rely on them so much that some of them  prefer using those sites to contact each other to talking to each other face to face  .
Many people argue that this is the most serious problem brought by social media sites  .
The usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life  , which will  , in turn  , cause the loss of interpersonal skills for many people  .
As we all know  ,  interpersonal skills are essential for us to communicate with each other and to present our views and ideas  .
The loss of interpersonal skills results in the inability of people to present their ideas well  .
As a result  , they will gradually decrease in their ability to compete with each other in  society  .
In conclusion  , social media sites cause both positive and negative consequences for people and society  .
As a part of this modern society  , we should learn to distinguish between good and bad impacts brought by the advancement of technologies  , and also learn to avoid the cons and maximize the benefits of those sites  .
A large amount of different kinds of disorders are caused by genetic reasons  .
Genetic disorders may or may not be  hereditary diseases and it is sometimes hard to find out whether one has these kinds of diseases  .
There is a long-standing discussion about whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives that his or her disease is caused by a gene  .
Legally  , the answer is no but  ,ethically  , the answer should be yes  .
We can't make a law to push a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives about his or her genetic problem  .
It is immoral and impractical  .
Firstly  , what kinds of diseases someone has is a matter or personal privacy  .
Privacy  belongs to one's human rights  .
If a law requires someone to tell others their privacy   , especially when they are not willing to do so  , it is againt their human rights and it is against the law's spirit  .
The law's spirit also includes  fairness  .
What is the basic difference between genetic disorders and other disorders  ?
It is unfair to release a law only point to  genetic disorders  .
In addition  , it is impractical to make such a law  .
A good law should be clear and easy to execute  .
However  , there are many problems with  asking a carrier to tell his or her relatives the cause of his or her disease  .
Firstly  , what is the range of  relatives  ?
For example  , does the carrier  need to tell their direct relatives  , like parents and brothers and sisters  , or do they also need to tell relatives like their grandmother's sister's son's daughter's nephew  ?
If you say only need to tell direct relatives  , it will be against the  law  .
Other relatives may have the same possibilities of havingthis kind of disease  .
How can a law made by the government exempt such a group of people from preparing to face their potential disease  ?
However  , from the ethical point of view  ,  the carrier  should have a feeling of responsibility to tell their relatives about their genetic disorder  .
By doing this   ,they may be able to save the lives of their relatives  .
This is because a carrier with a bad gene may not necessarily have the genetic disease if they can have coresponding healthy lifestyle before the age that the gene's function becomes stronger  .
A typical example is genetically caused hypertension  .
Hypertension can be caused by genetic problems which make it harder for the carrier to digest the fat and salt in blood which can cause hypertension  .
People usually get this kind of hypertension after they become adults  .
However  , if they already know they have a gene that may make them have ahigher possibility of getting hypertension  , they can build a daily habit of eating less salt and fat and thus  avoid hypertension  .
, our society can't push genetic problem carriers to tell their relatives about their disease but they should be willing to tell their relatives about their genetic problem  .
By doing so   , less of their beloved ones will suffer from the genetic problem  .
With the advancement of technology in recent years  , the need to keep in touch with people and the latest news has become a tremendous demand  .
Some of the famous examples would be social media sites like Twitter and Facebook  .
With  more than a billion users from all over the world  , social media sites have clearly demonstratedtheir success at playing an important part in our lives  .
However  , there are arguments that social media  brings in a reduction in face-to-face human contact  , which  , in turn  , affects interpersonal skills  .
Let's examine the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life and society  .
First and foremost  , all social media sites are free  .
All users need are an internet connection and an email account so that everyone can have a Facebook or Twitter ID to start their journey in social media   .
Secondly  , it helps people to keep in touch with one another  .
Finding old friends through Facebook  , for example  , is easier than asking people  in real life  .
Social media helps to lessen the hassle of geographical distance and brings people closer  .
Thirdly  , social media sites keep us up-to-date on the latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world  , all with a click  on the refresh button  .
Last but not least  , social media sites also link people together by allowing us to create our own groups  , pages or sites to share our hobbies  , interests and studies in particular subjects  .
Hence  , it is undeniable that these sites play an important role in our global interconnected world  .
However  , social media sites also have their  negative impact on humans  .
Undeniably  , it becomes more addicting when we spend more time busy socialising and interacting virtually  .
We spend the majority of our time on sites like Facebook  , Twitter and it affects our daily work productivity and performance  .
In the corporate world  , employers often block social media networks to prevent employees  spending their office time on their personal leisure rather than concentrating on their work  .
Using text-messaging language as an informal way of communicating on social media networks also brings in a bad impact on us in the long term  .
The more the time we spend on these sites  , the less time we spend on face-to-face interaction with one another  .
Hence it lessens valuable interaction between humans and time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone  .
In addition  , there are also some false reports and fake IDs  on both social media sites where people use fake IDs to insult or harass someone  , like the case of Heather Chua which occurred recently on Facebook  .
These malicious comments often go viral and it creates a strong negative effect on the real user in real life  , which might lead to unwilling attitude to interact with others in real life on the part of the victim  .
In conclusion  , everything has its two-sided affect and it depends on how we exploit it  .
With the current booming technology  , it is agreeable that people are becoming more tech savvy and they want to spend more time interacting with each other through social media sites  .
However  , it does not mean that we should neglect face-to-face human interaction as it plays an even more important aspect in our lives  .
As more and more social websites such as Twitter  , Facebook and Weibo  have become ubiquitous  , seamless and imperative in our life  , people may worry about the younger generation having problems with face-to-face communication skills  .
However  , I believe that the benefits brought by these online chat rooms tremendously outweigh their repercussions  .
Social media enable us to explore the world far far away without paying for expensive airplane tickets and sparing a one-week holiday  .
The convenience is beyond description  .
With a small smartphone or a computer at school  , at work or at home  , we can easily make friends worldwide with a 'click' and get to know about their life through having conversations with them  , reading their blogs  , photos and status  .
Compared to face-to-face interaction  , online conversation is easier for strangers to open their mouth to each other  .
Since some of the information has already been revealed on the home page  , it is also easier to find some common topics to talk about  .
Moreover  , people usually like to share boldly about their real feelings online with their masks in reality being taken off  .
It has been indicated in a report done by Boston University in 2012  , that 80% of information posted online is true  , while a person may lie 3 out of 10 times in real life  .
This shows that a Facebook friend may know more about you than your close friend who does not have a Facebook account  .
That is because we are acting who we are in reality while we have no reason to do that in the online virtual world  .
Although sometimes this genuine sharing of information may be inappropriate or even harmful  , such as prevalent use of vulgarity and harsh-meaning comments  , we can minimize those repercussions through strict regulation of content online  .
Another advantage of social media is in aiding the spread of democracy  .
People around the world can easily share their thoughts about their governments  .
That eliminates the incomplete information disadvantage for some remote rural regions where people are less aware of what is actually happening around them  .
One of the examples is the 2012 riots which happened in Egypt and Zambia  .
The idea of searching for democracy was passed from Egyptians to people in Zambia quickly through the use of social media  .
However  , as the government controls most of the media  , these social media may be tools of their campaign and manipulating the thoughts of the public  .
For example  , in the 2012 general election in Singapore  , Dr Tan Chee Keong made use of Facebook to spread his campaign videos to the public  .
Despite this  , social media is still a much fairer and more transparent online platform for the public to share ideas compared to other traditional media  .
Intensive use of social media does reduce the time people spend on face-to-face communication  .
It is commonly seen in a food court or restaurant that a group of people are sitting together around a table with each of them having a cell phone in their hands  .
They are too busy with their way too many virtual friends and some of them neglect the feelings of their real-life friends  .
In this case  , I have to say that to err is human  .
What we can do is to educate the public about the importance of their friends just by their side and teach them to manage their time well  .
In conclusion  , the use of social media has more advantages than disadvantages in our daily lifes  .
What we can do is to cautiously manage our time spent online and manage our words used online  .
With the regulation of government and relevant authorities  , the virtual world would be a better world  .
Social media sites' role in connecting people around the world is undeniable  .
Thanks to those social media  ,  communication between people all over the world is possible and can be done with ease  .
Apart from the ease of communication despite  the distance  , many other advantages such as knowledge sharing and trades can be done through social media as well  .
Nevertheless  , with those advantages  , some disadvantages may appear  , such as reduction in face-to-face human contact  , which affects interpersonal skills  , privacy issues  , as well as some frauds that can be done through social media  .
Twitter  , Facebook and Skype are some social media sites which enable us to keep in touch with our friends or family who are in other cities or countries  .
Through those sites  , we are able to talk to them  , to know what their activities are and who their friends are  , etc  .
From the surface point of view there is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite  the distance  .
The sharing of information can be done faster through social media as well  .
That is why  , nowadays  , many news publishers make their own social media account  .
For example  , Channel News Asia has a Twitter account and will update its followers with headline news  .
That shows how  ,actually news and information can be shared easily through social media  .
Furthermore  , since many teenagers and young adults are fans of social media  , this information can reach them easily without them needing to watch or listen to the news reports  .
Due to the popularity of social media  , many people have started to do their business via these sites  .
More and more advertisements can be found on Facebook  .
Whether it is our friends who are selling their products or professional brands selling their products online  , we can get to buy things and contact the sellers through those sites  , which can be considered as an advantage for us  , the buyers  .
However  , is it the same when we keep in touch with someone virtually compared to when we meet them personally  ?
I do think there is a difference  and I believe many of us will agree  .
When we write or communicate virtually  , we can hide our through feelings and may not become ourselves since we do not want the other party to judge us  .
Other than that  , sometimes the message of one party cannot be delivered properly to the other one since the communication is done through written language  , and thus the 'tone' of the message sent and when it is received may be different  .
Many people are very brave about telling people about their opinions online  , but in real life  , some of them can be very shy and not outspoken at all  .
This will lead to  bad interpersonal skills as well as  problems of trust  .
Nowadays  , we cannot really trust new people whom we know from social media  , since we will never know whether they are even 'real'  .
Some people fake their identities on social media sites so that they can know more people or some may even cheat others  .
In addition  , the issue of privacy has become more popular nowadays  , since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they were not willing to share in the first place  .
Therefore  , while social media sites  undoubtedly have benefits in our life  , we should consider their drawbacks and   , thus  , use them wisely so that we can gain more of their benefits and they disadvantages us in the smallest possible way  .
It is a common scene that almost everyone on  public transport is watching at a phone or wearing a pair ear piece in this modern society   .
Not only one but many developed and developing countries have the same picture  .
Some say that it is a necessary step in human revolution  .
Social media sites like Twitter and Facebook are popular among people for connecting to others even from different countries  .
It also brings many negative effects such as loss of face-to-face communication skills  , which are important in their workplace  .
This essay will discuss  the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life  .
One of the significant advantages of using a popular social media site is that people can reach other easily  , even without having had contact for a long time  .
In this fast paced and competitive world  , people may not be able to keep in touch with others  .
With the help of social media sites  , people are able to upload their new discoveries and funny scenes to them and they can be updated on the new information of their friends  .
Personally  , I  study  overseas  , and my busy study life keeps me  from contacting my old friends  .
Using a common social media site with my friends  helps me know what their statuses are nowadays  .
And I am able to easily find a common topic when I contact them  .
In Singapore  , many Malaysians cross the sea to work here  .
Many of them are busy in work and separated from their children  .
One of the managers in my workplace has the same situation  .
After my manager taught her mother how to use Facebook  , she was able to upload video clips of her grandchild  .
Therefore  , my manager would not miss  moments of her daughter's growth  .
Social media sites are also a very useful tool for people to start a new friendship or relationship  .
People with the same preferences get connected or closer  .
It is easier for people to approach the other person after knowing the information  .
Students can exchange  experiences in their studies even if they are in different countries  .
People are able to share  culture or pretty photos online  , and others can spread the joy with them  .
Thus  , I believe that social media sites are a useful tool to help people known each other better  .
However  , a social media site is a double-sided sword  .
It also has  some negative effects on our daily life  .
One of the disadvantages that many people are concerned about is that people lose  interest in face-to-face communication  .
Many people like to use language to pretend   , and lose confidence when they talk to each other  .
Although not everyone is good at public relationships   , even without the existence of  social media sites  , we cannot deny that they do affect some people's  interpersonal skills  .
In conclusion  , the shadow always exists when there is light  .
We should take the advantages of the creatures we create and try to avoid the negative effects  .
Social media sites are supposed to be a very useful and convenient tool to  bring people  closer in this globalised world  .
The use of social media has largely influenced our ways of communicating with one another  .
Online friends have become real life friends and real life friends communicate with one another online  .
Social media have changed our ways of exchanging information and conducting interpersonal relationships profoundly  .
There are advantages and disadvantages to this change  .
Social media have reshaped the way  we communicate  .
In real life  , we communicate with one another as equal participants  .
We share ideas and stories and forge friendships based on mutual respect  .
However  , communication on social media is largely based on "broadcasting and listening"  .
When we use Facebook and post pictures and statuses  , we are actively "presenting" façades of ourlivesstof others  .
We tend to post pictures with the best looks  ,statusess that are funny  .
We broadcast these facades ofourselvess to others  .
The images we choose to present are tentatively considered  .
The audience is not some specific person  , but everyone we might know  , or even the entire world  .
There is an element of seekingtr attention rather than expressing one's true opinion on social networks  .
On the other hand  , the viewer  , are not the listeners  .
They are just scrolling downf pages of pictures and statuses andseeinge one of them which they might thinkt funny  .
It is not the broadcasters themselves they care about  , but the content  .
This type of communication does nothelp withp forging interpersonal relationships  .
In real life  , establishinga friendshipp requires theall-roundd understandingofn one another ande caring for one another  .
The latter requiresface-to-faceeinteraction  ,n where we can show our emotions to the other  .
One cannot truly understand a personh only stalking his/herFacebookk page where he/she carefully chooses what to present  .
One cannot truly showone'sr emotionstoy another by texting some =) signs  .
The broadcasting and viewing model is not good for forging relationships  .
However  , it is good for sharing information  .
On social media  , everyone is a broadcaster and a viewer  .
With my social network account  , I seldom read newspapers or go to news websites anymore  , because I can easily read them from the status of my friends  .
If I am interested in politics  , I can just follow some politics newspapers or public figures  .
I get news about sales  , clothes and cosmetics from my friends  .
If some of my friends has horrible taste in clothes and he/she posts them often  , I can simply block him/her   .
Information gets circulated  .
The most popular information gets circulated the most  , so I  seldom miss it  .
Social networks play a role in providing and also filtering information  .
This saves a lot of time for me  reading newspapers and watching TV  .
Personally  , I feel more at ease on social media  .
From the above two points of view  , I think social media could forge more interest-based friendships  .
With the help of social media  , I become real life friends with those from online forums whom I share the same interest with  .
I also discover some of my friends' interests which I find in common with myself  , so that talking to one another is much more about life  , study  , friends  , etc  .
The communication does not focus on how we feel  ,  but on whatever is interesting  , or the content  .
In this case  , interpersonal skills are not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody  , but to get the information that we are both interested in  .
In conclusion  , I think social media have reshaped interpersonal relationships from a more human-based friendship that requires sharing and caring between friends  , to a more information-based friendship that requires a mutual interest  .
There are advantages and disadvantages in this  .
However  , we are still not sure whether it is good or bad  .
It is just different  .
People that live in the modern world really cannot live without  social media sites like Twitter and Facebook  .
Almost all students and young adults possess a Facebook or Twitter account  .
It is true that social media make people  able to connect with one another more conveniently  .
However  , it seems that  , especially for some   , sharing some parts of their lives such as videos and photos on the social media sites has become really necessary  .
An extremely interesting and ironic phenomenon was discovered that a group of friends met and sat around one table  , but none of them were really chatting with one another  .
Instead  , all of them were more interested in posting pictures of this "cheerful" meeting on their social media sites  .
Therefore  , there is a need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media  .
Social media enable people from different parts of the world to communicate with one another  .
People used to write letters and send postcards to keep in touch with ones living far away from them in the past  .
It could take a few days or weeks for them to receive the messages  .
Nowadays  , what people need to do is just type in front of the computer in their own rooms  .
And people on the other side will only need a second to receive the message  .
Distance and time are no longer  problems  , which is convenient  , especially when instant chat is needed  .
However  , when people become more and more addicted to this convenience and fail to communicate with people who are close to them  , their face-to-face interpersonal skills are lost  .
Social media provide people with a way of talking and chatting which can never be considered as a way of communicating  .
When one chats on those media sites  , there is no eye connection  , no emotion delivery and even the expressions are typed in by using some combinations of punctuation marks  .
For more convenience  , sentences are shortened to simply three or four words such as lol (which means laugh intensively) and "asap" (which means as soon as possible)  .
Indeed  , people go to great lengths to make their words as short as they can  .
While  , once they are communicating with people in their face  , expressing themselves appropriately becomes a really big problem  .
Social media also provide people with huge  information about people and things that interest them  .
For example  , on Twitter  , it is exciting to follow people that you adore  , like famous movie and series stars  , businessmen and entrepreneurs  .
It makes people feel extremely close to their admirers' lives and works  .
Updated news people care about can be easily obtained when you refresh your social media sites on your smartphones and laptops  , almost every time at any time  .
However  , after one has registered on those social media sites which are not reliable  , all the information you have filled in will be a weapon against you in the future  .
Furthermore  , not everyone on the social media sites is honest  .
The profile picture may not be of the person  that user says he or she really is  .
The reason might just be that he or she just wants to "decorate" his or her face  .
But there is a possibility that the person on the other side is deceiving you in order to obtain your information against you  .
The fact that there is no pledge of authenticity risks people's information  that is shared on social media sites  .
To sum up  , social media have advantages and disadvantages in people's daily life  .
They shorten the distance between people from all over the world and make instant communication possible  .
And it becomes more convenient to obtain and update information by using social media  .
On the contrary  , social media make people lose their ability to communicate effectively in their real lives and make people risk exposing their privacy to those whose identity cannot be verified on the social media sites  .
With the development of  technology  , social media becomes a more and more significant role in the whole world  .
Everyone in the world cannot stop using it every day to express their feelings or ideas and a lot of other things which helps their friends know their lives better  .
However  , this also raises  concerns about whether they bring us more benefits or a human disaster  .
Although it helps to connect us with our friends wherever we are  , at the same time  , it reduces the chance for us to talk to our friends face to face  , which may affect our interpersonal skills  .
Thus  , whether there are more advantages or disadvantages becomes a tough question for every human being  .
Many people say they will support  social media since it really helps them to have a closer view of how their friends are going in other parts of the world  .
This is especially relevant to people who are overseas  .
To them  , social media is the only resource they can approach to know everything happening in their home country and a way they can use to show their lives to their lovers as well  .
What's more  , these days  , social media play an important role in spreading  information  .
Nowadays  , people can just easily put their  on their Facebook account and wait for the response from others who are from different parts of the world  , which brings us a huge amount of convenience  .
It is quite significant especially for  young teenagers  , since they would rather go to these sites to see the news and know what is happening in this world than read the newspaper every day  .
However  , there are also a great amount of people who are against this technology  .
They worry a lot about the bad effect on  teenagers  , who are still developing   .
They point out that  , actually  , social media reduce the chance for us to talk to people around us face to face  .
The more we care about Facebook  , the less time we will have to spend with our friends  .
Nowadays  , it is quite common to see at some party  , people  prefer looking at their phones and reading all the posts on Facebook if they feel bored  .
It makes people worry because if all the teenagers continue using social media frequently  , they will decrease their ability to talk to people about  .
They will feel it becomes difficult for them to find any topics to communicate with other people  .
Personally  , I strongly agree that social media bring more disadvantages compared to the advantages they give us  .
Although it is really useful when we need to use it to let other people know we really live a good life  , it wastes  a lot of time as well  .
Think in another way  , if we put the time we spend on wandering on those sites  , we might already finish a book or do other more meaningful things  .
We should keep in mind that there are still ways for us to contact  our family or friends  .
Everything is bad if we don't know how to use it wisely  , no matter whether it is really good or not  .
As a result  , it is important for people to know that we need to be cautious about the time we spend on these social media  .
As stated above  , I strongly believe that if we can use social media wisely rather than abusing them  , we will all live a better life  .
Nowaadvantagesthe tdisadvantages becoming increasingly advanced  , more and more social media sites are appearing in our daily life  .
You can see people playing Facebook and Twitter through their smartphones or iPads on buses or on trains  .
Some may say that the appearance of these modern media will reduce the chances for people to communicate face to face  .
This essay will illustrate the pros and cons of using social media in modern society  .
First of all  , social media can make it more convenient for people to make friends and contact each other  .
Years ago when these modern products weren't popular  , the way for people to communicate or contact people far way were still restricted to making phone calls  , sending emails or writing letters  .
Some  take a long time and some are not efficient enough for people to get their response  .
However  , social media solve these problems well  .
People can contact their friends on the internet and get their reply very fast  .
The communication is also not limited to words  .
People can express themselves through pictures or emotions  .
People can also get to know their friends' state and mood by looking at their posts online  .
Moreover  , people can be aware of what is going on in social situations and see the comments online and share their opinions on these websites  .
These social media make people's lives much more colorful and provide a lot of fun  .
However  , social media may do some harm to people's lives  .
They will make people spend more time on chatting on the internet rather than communicating face to face  , such that  interpersonal skills will be badly affected  .
Some people spend a lot of time on them and forget their real life  .
Actually  , I have seen that some people are very funny and interesting when I am chatting with them online  .
However  , they behave quite boring when I talk to them in real life  .
Teenagers are developing their interpersonal skills and social skills when they are growing up  .
If they spend too much time on these social media  , it may cause some problems with their mental development  .
They may feel uncomfortable when they communicate with people face to face  .
Some may share fewer and fewer time with their family and not know how to express themselves  .
Moreover  , some wrong values on the websites will affect teenagers and confuse them  .
Some may even do something wrong  .
In conclusion  , the showing up of social media sites is a double-edged sword  .
It can make our life simpler  .
People can promote their friendships and relationships through these social media  .
However  , it can also make people forget to communicate with their family and friends in  real life and negatively affect  their interpersonal skills  .
But overall  , the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages  .
So we need to make the best use of these social media and make them a fun way of adding some excitement when life is boring  .
And try to bypass the shortcomings  .
And remember to send greetings to our friends and family frequently  .
Nowadays  , with the advancement of technology  , it is easy to communicate wherever you are  .
The appearance of social media sites truly connects people closely  .
People can know their friends' recent looks and interesting things happening to those people just by checking their Facebook or other social media sites  .
We cannot deny that  social media sites truly make  old friends  not lose  information and  chances to communicate with you even if you are in a different country  .
However  , the social media sites truly reduce  face-to-face communication   , which truly affects interpersonal skills  .
There are two advantages and two disadvantages of using the social media in  daily life  .
Firstly  ,  social media sites can closely connect people with their friends and parents  .
By typing  words and showing  pictures  , people can express  emotions that they are too shy to express face-to-face  .
For example  , on Mother's Day  , people are too shy to say "I love you" to their mothers  , but they can type it on their mother's Facebook page  .
Then their mother will also know the emotion and feel warm  .
On the other hand  , when a teenager is studying in a foreign country  , the internet is the only way that he can communicate with his parents and friends  .
Therefore  , the social media are truly good for people  .
Secondly  ,  social media sites can not only closely connect people with their friends  .
People can also know much information about  celebrities on Twitter and Facebook  and get the  on them  .
They can learn how these people succeed and they can also have the chance to talk with them and know these famous people's thoughts by using the social media  .
On the other hand  , with the help of social media  , some homeless people or someone who needs  money to cure a disease can get  help from the world quickly  , because once one person knows the information  , he or she will share it with their "friends area"  , then many people will know  and spread the information to  people who can give help  .
On the other hand  , there are also problems with the population of the social media  .
Firstly  , when people rely on  social media to communicate with their friends and parents  , they will become accustomed to communicating by typing and not talking  .
People even prefer talking to their friends and meeting their friends online and gradually reject face-to-face communication  .
Therefore  ,  social media truly limit  interpersonal skills such that people lose the chance and the ability to practice talking and  between them and their friends  .
Secondly  , without  true communication in  real life  , people lose the ability to see the truth and false  .
There are many people on  social media with beautiful images and good content on their pages  , but in real life  , he or she may  not have a job or may live poorly  .
Teenagers may believe these people and easily be cheated and lose money  , or even their safety  .
Therefore  ,  social media are not safe  , which is bad for teenagers' future development  .
All in all  , the appearance of social media truly helps people a lot in many areas  .
However  , there exist some disadvantages which will affect people to some degree  .
Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Social Media in Our Daily life and Society  .
Nowadays  , with the development of technology and society  , social media have become more popular and even important in our daily life  .
We communicate with others using social media  , such as Twitter  , Facebook and microblog more and more frequently  .
There is no need  for people to go out of their home to interact with others  .
They chat online  , share pictures  , tell others what they have done or funny stories  .
It seems that people build a good relationship with others through  social media  , but  problems come out  .
People do not know how to talk with others face to face  , especially  strangers  .
Therefore  , we need to talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life and society  .
As for the advantages  , there are two aspects: more convenient to contact others  , easier to know about others  .
One advantage is that it is more convenient to contact others by social media  .
In the old days  , if one wanted to tell some important news to someone who lives far away  , one needed to write letters and that wastes time  .
The long distance and time-consuming made spreading  messages very difficult at that time  .
Therefore  , people did not contact   faraway friends and relatives unless there was something important  .
However  , people can now contact  anyone all over the world who can use a computer at any time  , and there is no time delay to messages  .
The other advantage is that it is easier to know about others through social media  .
If there were no social media  , it would be difficult for people to know about a stranger  .
They could collect information about that person by asking their friends  , colleagues or family members  .
And the information collected might not be intact and true  .
Unlike today  , with the help of social media  , people can easily get the information they want just by searching online  , and know about what that person does every day and at what time  .
As for the disadvantages of social media in our daily life  , these include wasting time  , causing illness related to sitting a long time in front of the computer  , quick-spread of rumor and fake news  , and most importantly  , making people lose the ability to talk to others confidently face to face  .
It is weird that people sit around a table but all face at their phones and do not talk with each other  .
If there is a joke on their Facebook page  , they may talk to others in this way: "hi  , look  , how ridiculous this is"  .
Then they laugh together  .
No matter whether it is a party  , dinner or just a simple get-together  , there are always some people bowing their head and playing with their phones  , even if their family and friends are in front of them  .
In  conclusion  , there are both advantages and disadvantages of using social media in daily life  .
People should enjoy the advantages of social media while being aware of the disadvantages  and try their best to avoid the disadvantages happening to them and their friends and family  .
In an age of rapid technological advancement  , a lot of medical breakthroughs are made possible  .
Genetic testing is made possible and available for   .
It is able to detect  illnesses or diseases and even a child's parentage  .
However  , it will become a controversial issue as it becomes a dilemma for a carrier of a known genetic risk whether to inform his or her relatives  .
If the knowledge of the genetic risk was to be shared with the family or relatives  , there might have chances for them to have it in their blood which they may do the necessary precautions to prevent  .
But  , if the genetic disease is a terminal disease  , most  relatives will be disheartened upon learning about it  .
Therefore  , some carriers will have the opinion of keep it  a secret  .
This essay will discuss  whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives or not  .
Some say that the genetic risk that is found in a person should be kept secret because it is considered as  personal information which should be kept confidential  .
Most patients will be depressed after realising theircondition  .
If someone has a genetic disease  , after the test  , they might not wish to inform their relatives as they might end up disheartening their extended family  .
Some will wish to keep it to themselves and hope to ensure that they will not bring  any pessimism into their family  .
Furthermore  , some will wish not to become a burden to anyone  , as seeking medical attention is relatively costly  .
