Their lives had become meaningless and a lot of them chose to suicide without giving trouble to  others .
Nowadays , things have changed .
Disabled people walk with artificial legs , man can get pregnant , even the sex of  humans can be changed just by doing simple surgery .
It is really a great achievement in the enhancement of technology which should be recorded in history .
In conclusion , the reason why population ageing is increasing  is due to the great improvement of  global medical science .
It is a challenge but also an achievement .
Population ageing is a global phenomenon that has arisen in both developed and developing countries .
The average life span rose from 45 years old in the 1920s to over 65 years old in the 2010s .
In a social science report last year , this number could further increase to 90 years old in the 2080s due to  advanced medical technology and better living standards .
Population ageing means that there are more retired old people in  society and the portion of working adults is decreased .
It may cost a higher social cost burden which further leads to a greater allocation of funds in the government's yearly budget .
Medical expenses ,  and accommodation are the costs which directly involved   old people .
It is the responsibility of the government to ensure the living of old people .
Otherwise , there would be more and more people staying on the street and destroying the good views of the Garden City .
In addition , it is also a challenge for the government , families and parents to educate  children about  moral of filial .
With  moral of filial , most of the children will take care of their parents after the parents' retirement  .
It prevents children from sending them to an old folk's house and not visiting them at all .
We also do not want to see the happening of worst things that parents are dropped by children in the street and let them die by themselves .
It may be a challenge but also a golden opportunity to educate their children properly to prevent  undesired outcomes .
Life expectancyhas risen significantly from the past to recent all over the whole world .
It is the outcome of advanced medical technology , changing  lifestyles and higher living standards .
However , among the under-developed countries , developing countries and developed countries , we found that there is the longest life span in the developed countries , followed by the developing countries , and the shortest life span in the under-developed countries .
This observation means that the more developed the country , the longer the life span its citizens .
In the other words , it also can be said that it is an achievement to obtain an ageing population .
People should be proud to have an ageing population because it is hard to achieve unless there are advance medical technology and higher living standards .
Besides that , an ageing population has an important and essential thing that we cannot buy in cash .
It is  experience overa lifetime .
At  work , supervisors usually ask the so-called "old staff' to lead the newbies .
This shows  the importance of experience .
With the existance of experience , we can do the work more quickly without sacrificing  standards and quality .
It may lead to a shorter ways to the decision and provide more sales and revenue for the company .
The economy of country is boosted  and could further lead to  new development and raise  our living standard .
In conclusion , there are challenges as well as achievement in  rising life expectancy which we cannot exclude .
Therefore , we must encounter the challenges and be proud of the achievement to create a new life for our next generation .
As we are humans  , who are different from other animals , we have some basic rights like the right to privacy , the right to life , the right to have a family and so on .
Among these basic rights , the most important one is the right to life .
During the less developed times , due to disasters like droughts , floods or severe contagious diseases like the Black , people at that time could lose their property and lives easily since they did not have enough power to protect themselves and restore their life in a short time .
However , as  technology has developed , it has increased people's mobility and productivity as well as life expectancy .
As we can use  resources with maximum efficiency , we can enjoy more and more then at any time of human society .
Even when  disaster comes , we can restore the order of our life in a relatively short time compared to before .
For example , the tsunami that hit Tohoku of Japan in 2011 was "the toughest and the most difficult crisis for Japan in the 65 years after the end of World War II"  (CNN , 2011) .
However , only one year has passed and most of the survivors have come back to their normal lives although with  sad memories .
This was not imaginable during less developed times .
With the strong  support of technology , the rise in life expectancy can be seen as an achievement to the development of our human society .
However , along with the increase in life expectancy , ageing problems have become more and more severe .
Two of the most important causes of the ageing problem are  increasing longevity and declining fertility .
The increasing longevity is due to the fast development of  society as well as  living pressure .
The increasing pressure will lead to  declining fertility .
As people who are incapable of production become more and more , our society could follow a downward trend .
Moreover , as we use up more and more resources , what we have left may not be enough for us to live on if we do not have enough human resources to  research and develop new technology .
Therefore , the increase of life expectancy is also a great challenge .
As I have mentioned above , the increase in life expectancy is an achievement as well as a challenge .
Surveillance technology such as RFID has been used to track people and may help to reduce the number of people who get lost .
For example , there are always news in the newspaperabout some elderly who get lost at certain places and their families are looking for them .
The family members must be worrying a lot about the lost elderly , and with the help of police officers  , maybe they can find the elderly  , but it will take a long time , and a lot of energy to find someone in a country that has a population of about five million without knowing the exact location of that person .
However , if the elderly has been implanted with a RFID device , then it will be much easier for the family to find him or her with the special serial number issued to each device .
They can track the location of the device with the information provided by the RFID signals and find the location of the lost elderly in a shorter period of time .
Surveillance technology will help to prevent families from losing their members  , especially the elderly and the children who need to be paid more attention to .
Nowadays , population aging has become a more global phenomenon .
Subsequently , a lot of problems regarding to it are arising .
Due to the rise of  life span and the shrinking of  birth rate , the portion of  elderly  is becoming larger and larger .
As our society develops ,  people have a much higher living standard , which will reduce the chance of getting disease .
Besides , with the development of the technology ,  medical therapy has also had  tremendous progress .
Many diseases which were incurable in the past can be cured now .
Therefore , the patient will have a bigger chance to be cured and survive .
Both of the two reasons will decrease the number of dead people annually .
On the other hand , the birth rate in many countries keeps decreasing;whose figure is the lowest record compared to the previous figure .
Maybe , it is because  modern society has become more and more competitive;  parents are paying much attention and importance to their careers .
They do not want to bother to spend so much time in raising and nurturing children .
Maybe that is one reason for the reducing in the birth rate .
First , if the older people increase , there will be a fewer workforce that can support  society .
However , an ageing population will also increase many kinds of other expenditure .
The most important part is health care and old-age pensions .
As elderly people , they need more money for health care than  younger people .
Government will also make a bigger amount of pension expenditure .
Secondly , for  older people , more facilities and service for them will need to be provided .
So more manpower will be employed , which reduces  labour in other areas .
Of course , more money will be spent .
To pay this extra money , government will exert higher taxes on  other people .
Thirdly , compared to  young people , the security of the elderly is more notable .
Elderly people's ability to move and act is much lower .
They will be more vulnerable to be hurt or get some injures .
Therefore , some  and education about this should be taken by the government and the surrounding people to ensure the security of the old people .
To conclude , the population ageing phenomenon indeed shows our big achievement in economics , medical skills and living standard .
Nonetheless , the issues it brings out are more worthy to be considered .
More elderly people will bring a very extra burden to  society and government .
More facilities and service will be needed to fulfill these requirements .
Definitely , we should perform these demanded duties very responsibly and carefully .
Whereas , for the sustainable development of the country and the earth , some  and policies should be carried out to control and change this phenomenon .
Rising life expectancy is an achievement because it is  evidence of progress in modern medical technology and  it is a challenge because it can incur the problem of atoo smallworkforce or too large population .
It is natural that rising life expectancy is regarded as an achievement .
The goal of every species of living things is reproducing to increase the quantity of their species .
Humankind is not an exception .
People with rising life expectancy would ensure a large population and large species in human beings .
It is more secure for us because  with longer life expectancy it is harder for people to die out .
Rising life expectancy is also  evidence of progress in modern medical technology .
For ancient people , it was miraculous to achieve 70 years old , but now it is general .
Rising life expectancy can bring us a more skilled workforce because we can delay the retirement time to extend the working time for each person .
A longer working period means  old people who are more skilled do not need to retire and inexperienced workers will not take over .
Thus , it is more efficient to keep more skilled people for long time rather than training fresh men .
Rising life expectancy can be a challenge .
There are two possibilities .
On the one hand , if there are less young people and more old people , alacking workforce problem will arise .
On the other hand , if there are enough young people , then young people with rising life expectancy will cause a larger population .
If there are more young people , then there would be even more elderly with rising life expectancy in the future  .
If The population is large while  resources are limited ,  many problems will incur such as environmental problems and inequality among people .
Expansion of population cannot continue like that because  resources are limited , and we will end up dying out after using up all resources .
To sum up , with rising life expectancy , there exists both achievement and challenge .
It is  progress of human beings that we control the world and maintain our population with longer life expectancy , but it also has a potential crisis for both nations or  human beings .
We can either step back to maintain the population with some method , or step forward to search for more resources in outer space .
If a country can bear an ageing population , it is a thing that the country can be proud of .
In the first place , it must have grasped an an advanced health care system .
The ageing problem is in essence a problem of worsening bodies .
With increasing age , people become more prone to disease and injury , and have more difficulty recovering .
Without advanced health care system , aged people have a higher rate of death .
In fact , this was the major limitation of people's average life span in the past .
With advanced medical technology , not only can many diseases be cured , but also people know how to keep themselves healthy .
If a developed health care system is increasing the positive side , it would be also helpful to reduce the negative side , which includes reducing  hazards in the environment .
Health care by far is the most expensive to carry out .
If the environment is too dangerous to live in , there would not be sufficient medical resources for usage .
Such environmental hazards come from various aspects .
A major source of the hazards is  pollution .
A place with heavily polluted air and water is by no means a good habitat and will bring a lot of health problems for its residents , among which aged people and children will be harmed the most .
Only if the city is safe and comfortable can people live a longer and happier life .
If the above two aspects are described as the hardware of the system , they do require  software to function , which is  ubiquitous good will for senior citizens .
When people become old , most of them join the weak group of citizens who have to  receive care from other people .
If  society has the most advanced medical science and the best environment , but does not grant  access to them for its senior citizens , it just does not help .
And if people in society do not want to care for their elderly , nothing will be done for them .
Only when there is  ubiquitous good will for senior citizens can  aged people live well , and that is a thing to be proud of .
With the glory , there come problems .
To take care of old people , facillities such as nursing homes need to be built , which add on to the expenses of society .
An even larger share of the old people expense lies in  health care .
In addition , old people are weakened in many aspects , thus they are usually not considered as labors .
When the percentage of old people grows larger in the population , the labor are considered to become less and each labor needs to pay more for the welfare of the old people .
In summary , the rising average life span is both a challenge and an achievement because it means an increase in load and the advancement of society , including , at least ,  an advanced health care system , reduced hazards in the environment and  ubiquitous good will for senior citizens , at the same time .
"The weak is meat and the strong eat it" does not apply nowadays .
Advanced technology saves lots of lives which should never have come to this world or should pass away .
For people , this is an achievement , but for nature , it changes its rules and cycles , which is a big challenge faced by human beings .
If anyone has ever read any fiction or stories written before the 18th century , it is very hard to find any character in those stories who lived longer than 80 years old .
They may die from hunger , die from illness or just went to bed as usual but never woke again .
In China , there is a famous saying that there are things that should be celebrated , one is red and one is white .
Here , red things mean marriage and white means someone passing away .
The first time  I read this saying I was confused why someone passing away is a good thing that people should celebrate and later I was told that in past , it was hard to live longer than 60 years old and even though you are very lucky to live longer than 60 years old , you will suffer a lot from illness or  sadness for your younger relatives passing away , so people think it is worth celebrating since the old person will not suffer any longer .
It is very hard to understand such a feeling that people felt in the past .
Now , technology and science has developed at an unbelievably fast pace .
There is lots of illness that was thought incurable in the past that has vanished in the world .
Even  people with cancer , which is still hard to cure , now have more chances to survive and have a longer time to live .
Besides illness , the improvement in technology generates more food both in quantity and in quality .
At the same time , it also frees a great amount of labor .
Now people not only can have food to survive but also enjoy high-level food and even pursuing  tasty and luxury food .
It is a break-through of technology and science , and an outstanding achievement of human wisdom .
The world is always fair to us .
While we are celebrating   break-throughs on our way to Utopia , we are  facing  a new challenge .
We cannot give up what we achieved in the past and follow the natural way to die and be reborn .
Therefore , the only way available for us to destroy such a balance is accelerating the progress of development in order to increase the capacity of our planet .
With the world is becoming more and more advanced , people are leading a more and more comfortable life .
Moreover ,  life expectancy has also been raised due to the development of the economy .
However , while we are enjoying the fruits from the development of the economy , we are also facing a global problem --- population ageing .
There is no doubt that this problem has become more and more serious and has gradually influenced the tendency of the population as well as  source allocation .
Therefore ,  rising life expectancy can be considered both a challenge and an achievement .
On one side , we cannot deny that rising life expectancy is a great achievement .
The reason why  life expectancy have aroused is that we are becoming more and more clever due to  evolution , and we are becoming richer and richer due to the knowledge we have learned .
Since  we get richer , we have more money to use to live a more comfortable life .
Therefore , because of the great efforts we have made , we have been living a better life .
And that is what we are striving for .
So  rising life expectancy can be regarded as  proof of what we have made to  for ourselves .
On the other side , we have to say that the obvious problems that we are facing are also caused by rising  life expectancy .
Since  we have  better living circumstances and higher living quality , we are leading a longer life .
This seems to be  gratifying progress at the first sight .
However , during the process of  developing  our life , we decided to reduce the rapid growth of population by adopting the measure of controlling birth so that  can also be slowed down .
This also works and we have  seen the effect .
Then there comes a problem .
Because  the birth rate is reduced while the death rate is also reduced , the percentage of the elderly is increased while that of the youth is decreased .
So  population is getting more and more aged .
But the primary labor force as well as the work force is from  youth .
That is to say , the population aging has aggravated the burden of  society .
Then we can see that  rising life expectancy can also be viewed as a challenge for us to face .
Taken together , we should say that  rising  life expectancy is two-sided .
It has been shown that we are leading a better life but we are forced to face the problem of solving population aging .
However , the achievement that we have made is far more than the problems caused by the challenges .
The significance of our existence is to lead a meaningful life and combat for the development of our world .
There is no absolutely perfect way , so we have done a good job on the road .
Therefore , we need to continue  our striving as we try our best to reduce the adverse impact  .
Rising life expectancies is an achievement because it clearly demonstrates that overall quality of life is increasing in both developed and developing countries .
However , it is also a challenge because it strains both society and the environment .
It is well-known statistically that , generally , as a country develops  life expectancy increases .
This is the result of a better quality of life; which is basically sufficient food and clean water , better sanitation and advanced healthcare .
With sufficient food , children will develop properly into adults .
Better sanitation will result in fewer deaths by infection and significantly reduce the spread of diseases and viruses .
Advanced healthcare is also a major factor in prolonging an individual's existence on earth .
Examples of how advanced healthcare in the city has raised life expectancy are such as antibiotics , the cure of poliomyelitis , and better and cleaner surgical procedures .
All of these are human achievements in their own right that have resulted in rising life expectancy , and hence they also illustrate why rising lifeexpectancy can be considered an achievement .
It is remarkable that the population aged 60 and over is increasing at 2% to 3% annually in developing countries as well .
It is highly plausible that the results for the increase are the same as the developed countries .
If that is true , it means that human rights and living standards are increasing in developing countries , albeit slowly .
Fewer famines , better sanitation and more access to healthcare in developing countries will be this century's greatest achievement as a global society .
However , an aging population is taxing on a country .
Although life expectancy may increase significantly , the population's overall productivity may not increase linearly .
The elderly will end up putting a burden on the society that they have been contributing to their whole working career .
With falling birth rates , there will be fewer working adults in society to distribute the workload .
In addition , an aging population will require more healthcare and treatment because one's constitution weakens as one ages .
The challenge is how many lives can the society and community afford to sustain; and it will only become increasingly difficult to handle .
Rising lifeexpectancy is also an environmental challenge because a better quality of life requires a lot of energy .
More food , clean water , better sanitation , and healthcare consume large quantities of energy .
An example is the modern method of intense farming .
Large quantities of energy are needed for the pesticides , and to harvest and transport the food produced around the globe .
If the current quality of life is sustained or increased in order to keep increasing  life expectancy , it will  continue to have a huge impact on the environment .
The challenge will be increasing the quality of life while being environmentally sustainable .
Rising life expectancy can be considered an achievement and a challenge because it is the by-product of rising quality of life , bringing along its glory and its dirty little secrets .
At the present time , people are more concerned about their health .
There are better health care systems to let people check their physical condition regularly , and more and more people choose organic food and eat a balanced diet to make themselves healthier .
As a result , the  worldwide now .
Projections of the United Nations show that the population aged more than 60 is increasing at 2% to 3% in the developed and developing countries respectively .
Rising life expectancy is a big achievement of human beings .
However , as there are only limited space and resources on earth , rising life expectancy is also a challenge for all  people worldwide .
Rising life expectancy is a technological achievement .
Back in  ancient days when human beings first appeared on the earth , the average life expectancy was  less than 20 .
The reasons were mainly due to the threat of fierce animals like tigers and lions , the lack of food , the lack of hygiene knowledge , and also very importantly , the lack of medicine .
With the development of society over the past thousands of years ,  technology has been progressing and  concern for health is rising , so that higher life expectancy is achieved .
With more advanced technology in medicine  , more and more diseases can be cured so that much more death is avoided .
Since people get higher education today , increasing amounts of people have switched from fast food to organic food and have a balanced diet so that their chance of getting cancer is lowered .
Such a situation is  major progress from  ancient times and also a big achievement by all human beings .
However , since  space and resources on earth are very limited , higher life expectancy means more people will live on the earth at the same time and more fierce competition for food and space is unavoidable .
Since there are more people on the earth , more space is needed for people to live in , so  some farming land might be turned into buildings to accommodate more people .
However , the need for food is also increasing , so  the competition might become even more frightening .
Even worse , since people are unsatisfied with the amount of space and food they have , violence might take place more frequently .
Much violence that has happened in Middle East is just due to the fight for food and water resources .
With more people living on the earth , pollution might become even serious , and as a result of pollution , the supply of food and water will decrease , so that a negative loop will occur and the problem becomes even harder to solve .
In a word ,  rising  life expectancy is both an achievement and a challenge for  whole human beings .
Advanced technology has helped us to live longer , but the limited resources on earth is also a big challenge .
We should do our best to cooperate with each other and live on the same earth in harmony .
With the development of  modern society , people live longer .
Statistics show that worldwide , the average life expectancy at birth was 66 .57 years for 2009 according to CIA World Factbook 2009 .
In  developed countries like Japan and Switzerland ,  life expectancy can be  more than 80 .
Normally , people will regard an extended life expectancy as an achievement , and usually use such data as a measure of the development of  countries .
However , as the population is ageing ,  challenges such as increased medical cost and shortage of workers also exist .
In a nut shell , rising life expectancy can be considered both an achievement and a challenge .
Indeed , thanks to improved living standards and medical care , countless people's lives have been extended .
No doubt life is the most precious treasure of human beings .
Without life , we have nothing .
In the long history of the evolution , we are always struggling for life against starving and illness .
In last two centuries , we humans have made the greatest achievement in developing our society .
We have modernized and we have gained improved living standards and medical care .
We are no longer bothered by starving and common illness .
In  ancient times , residents may only live for 30 years; but now , the life expectancy can be into the 80s in many countries .
With a doubled life time , humans can have achance to explore the real meaning of life .
There is a Chinese saying that there is nothing more valuable than to save a man's life .
Hence ,  rising life expectancy no doubt can be considered as a great achievement .
On the other hand , the aging of thepopulation can also be a challenge to  society .
When people grow old , they will be weak and get sick easily .
This is a natural law which nobody can violate .
Hence , when the ratio of the seniors whose age is above 60 reaches some certain point , the challenge to  society cannot be neglected anymore .
First ,  medical costs will rise greatly .
If the individual or family is to pay the bill , they can be bankrupted because of illness .
If the medical cost is covered by the government budget , the deficit will be a heavy burden affecting the normal operation of the government .
Second , the shortage of workers can also endanger the development of the society .
Japanese society is now facing a severe ageing problem , and the path of development is seriously slowed .
There has been a report estimating that by the year 2060 , only half of the population in Japan will be suitable to work .
The same situation is happening around the world .
Obviously , rising life expectancy should also be considered as a serious challenge .
To conclude ,  rising life expectancy must be considered both an achievement and a challenge .
To extend our life is not only a symbol of our achievement in developing our society , but also a fulfillment of our original dream .
At the same time , we also need to consider the negative effects brought by the ageing population , and then find proper measures to counter the challenges .
As technology increasingly advances , many of things that were regarded as impossible are turning into possible .
From theInternet and email to the most powerful surveillance technology , every step is an advancement for not only society but also the world's achievements .
People's lives  from increasingly convenient to almost luxurious , thanks to the implementation of increasingly advanced technology available for man's life .
Although such rapidly advancing technology though can be extremely useful to our daily life; it can also cause invisible or massive threats to our peaceful life that can be beyond our imagination and estimation .
Today , surveillance technology has become almost manifest wherever we go .
Take Singapore for example , surveillance is installed everywhere from highly secured places such as Government sectors to working places , from condominiums to housing development board houses , and even school canteens and toilets !
Even applications in our Iphones or other smartphones , or our I-pads can easily reveal our location .
Every move  is being closely surveilled and followed once we step out of our homes .
Now , surveillance technology such as RFID has even been invented to track people .
I agree to a great extent that RFID technology should not be easily available to the public or taken for granted .
On the other hand , I will also discuss how RFID can be utilized for good purposes .
On the other hand , I think RFID can be useful with appropriate handling and usage .
For example , it can be a very beneficial and useful device for the force to track crime suspects and terrorists for their movements , or contributing to more leads for solving a case .
Additionally , if appropriately used , this device can contribute to our scientific findings and research .
In this , I mean that we can input this device into animals or birds species , to track their movements and actions  .
RFID is indeed a great invention .
It can benefit mankind if appropriately used .
However , I think such powerful devices should not be made easily available to the public or fall into the hands of 'ill-intentioned' individuals .
This will lead to more crimes and bring threats to our privacy .
Population ageing is now a heated expression in individuals' lives .
These two words can be seen in various media and assessments of this social trend are of great number .
When mentioning   population ageing , the media always considers it  a social problem .
It is deniable that population ageing can cause a lot of problems , but in the same time , it is also a symbol of improvement .
Therefore , population ageing should be considered both a challenge and an achievement .
The following paragraphs have  more specific explanations .
Rising average life expectancy can surely cause some problems .
Firstly , the aging population is generally of low productivity .
It is a natural rule that when people grow older , their bodies will be less flexible and brains will operate slower , so they will contribute less to  society .
In addition , elderly people are using the same or even more  social resources , as they need more medical support and human help caused by their weaker physical status .
Furthermore , to make livings , many senior citizens go back to work  .
It will also induce many problems .
For example , these senior citizens may do the work less efficiently  which will lead to a lower effective output .
To make him or her more competitive so that the elderly person is not beaten by the younger , old people usually accept lower compensation or bonus .
This may lead to the younger's lower employment rate and opportunities and thus they have to live with huge pressure and lower living standard to reduce  daily cost .
Besides , the elderly with less salary also have to lower their living standard; both the consequences can cause a decrease in social happiness level and drive the whole society in  a less stable situation .
There are also some older people who a rich life with their deposits and retirement compensation .
They can live a happy life , but actually to the society as a whole , it is a waste of social resources .
Also , the growing percentage of older people will cause the maintenance of many traditional thoughts and mindsets which may   resist   positive social change .
Above all ,  population aging will be a great challenge for the world for it drags the development of  society .
However ,  growing life expectancy is also an achievement to  human society .
Actually , living a longer life needs a lot of conditions to realize .
There are many factors which will result in the death of people , such as natural disasters , accident , diseases or suicides .
A long lifespan for the individual  is a great achievement which indicates he or she is brave enough to face a life full of problems .
For the whole society , rising life expectancy are a symbol of more advanced science and technology especially in the medical field , better social environment and a safer world .
Therefore , humans need to appreciate the longer lifespan and consider it as an achievement .
Every coin has two sides .
Rising life expectancy is like a two-sided sword in the modern world .
It can cause many problems but it also means a lot for the human beings .
What we can do now is to try hard to solve the problems and in the same time appreciate its great meanings .
Rising Life Expectancy: Not Only an Achievement , But Also a Challenge
According to recent research , population ageing is a global phenomenon and the current average life span is over 65 .
The rising of life expectancy is not only an achievement , but also a great challenge .
Obviously , rising  life expectancy is a mark of our achievements in terms of hospital technology , insurance condition , cultural development , and our social system , which shows the improvement of people's life quality .
Thanks to the development of technology and society , some deadly diseases in the past are curable now , and people are more aware of how to take care of our body .
This is a great achievement made by a generation .
At the same time , it is also a great challenge .
With  population ageing and the increasing portion of  old people , we are facing lots of problems now .
For individuals , since people's life expectancy are becoming longer , there will be more troubles for them to take care of themselves , especially for those who live alone or have diseases and are poor .
For example , it becomes hard for them to earn their living; they may feel lonely especially if their spouses have died; they may suffer from all kinds of diseases .
And they may not get as much attention from their family as before .
For families , certainly , the burden on young people has become heavier .
In China , lots of families only have one child .
That means when the child grows up , he or she needs to take care of both parents .
One family at least should take care of four old people .
For a few groups of families , there are even up to eight old people since their grandparents are also living with them .
Besides financial burdens , they may also need to spend more energy to take care of them .
These may be too much for these young parents as they still need to look after their own children .
For society , when the group of old people becomes larger and less people can work for the society , this society may lack of labourers .
And at the same time , these old people take up a larger portion of resources and budget of this society .
To some degree , it will delay the economic development of the world .
Besides , society needs to figure out more policies to secure old people's lives .
Also , the population ageing calls for a higher standard of medical treatment and technology and a higher level of civilization of our life .
If our spiritual aspect of civilization cannot match our material aspect , old people will have  tough twilight years .
Now population aging is a trend .
It is an achievement of our society , but it is also a great challenge calling us to face the new situation .
Population ageing deemed to be an achievement when it first happened .
In the old times , people could easily lose their life due to hunger , disease , government , war or something else .
After a country was just founded , some immature policy leaded to  nationwide hunger .
Millions of people could not find food to eat and ended up eating all the trees and grass which could be seen .
There was everywhere wandering people trying to find food .
Some people even eat their own dead children .
There was a saying which says that hunger can bring people back to animals .
