Some may use it to peek or record something illegal.
For example, it could be installed in personal lockers to record other's moves and actions.
This technology could also be seen as invading human privacy.
Surveillance technology could cause everyone to feel paranoid and as if our actions are being watched.
This could lead to psychological implications and thus cause many tremendous social effects that may be harmful to our society.
If everyone is being watched unknowingly, it seems that our freedom of doing things is compromised .
Technology can  a very useful tool if it is used in the correct manner.
It may be  help to prevent potential crimes from happening but also help people commit crimes .
The  installing surveillance should be taught to everyone so that crimes could be eliminated instead of increase  .
However, the more people use it over us, the more power they will have on us.
We should respect that everyone has human rights and without permission, this technology should not be placed or implanted in anyone.
We do not want to be sued for infringing  privacy; therefore, before implanting any RFID, we should ask for consent .
Surveillance technology is getting more and more widely used with the development of modern technology in terms of various scientific breakthroughs.
And after all this scientific research result is applied to daily life.
Products such as RFID tracking systems have become real.
RFID is not only used to track products for logistical and storage purposes, it is also used to track people through human implants.
It is unacceptable for some people in society .
However, I think this application is necessary and provides society a lot of benefits .
Surveillance technology such as RFID has been used to track people and may help to reduce the number of people who who get lost.
For example, there are always reports in the newspaper about some elderly people get lost at certain places and their families are looking for them .
The family members must be worrying a lot about the lost elderly person, and with the help of police officers, maybe they can find the elderly person, but it will take a long time, and a lot of energy to find someone in a country that has a population of about five million without knowing the exact location of that person.
However, if the elderly person has been implanted with a RFID device, then it will be much easier for the family to find him or her with the special serial number issued to each device .
They can track the location of the device with the information provided by the RFID signals and find the location of the lost elderly person in a shorter period of time.
