In the modern digital world, electronic products are widely used in daily life such as smart phones, computers and etc.
In the workplace places, electronic devices, such as computers, are also inevitable to increase the productivity of the corporation.
The convenience and high efficiency of using electronic products has been noticed by people worldwide.
Some people have started to wonder if electronic products can  and outperform human beings .
Surveillance technology, such as RFID (radio-frequency identification), is one  example that is being currently implemented.
In this essay, I will discuss whether surveillance technology, such as RFID (radio-frequency identification), should be used or not used to track people.
Personally, I agree to a large extent that surveillance technology, such as RFID, should be used to track people.
Surveillance technology, such as RFID, can be operated twenty-four hours without  operators to track every detail about human activities.
For instance, in the military,, surveillance technology is essential as it is a way to provide undeniable evidence if anything is at fault .
In supermarkets, where it is difficult to catch thieves, surveillance technology, which makes records that can be replayed or detects theives on the spot, is beneficial .
The high accuracy of surveillance technology eliminates the number of disagreements among people.
If people are aware of the existence of surveillance, the possibility they would follow rules and orders is high.
It is useful as it reduces the chances of wrongdoing occurring .
Therefore, surveillance technology makes our society more law abiding .
Risks could be analyzed if there is the record of what happened in the past.
In the late nineteenth century, a severe air crash occurred at Miami International airport.
A fire started in the air cargo to a Valujet plane after the plane had taken off.
The electric systems short circuited with a result that the airplane was out of control and  to the ground at extremely high speed.
All passengers and pilots died .
After finding and analyzing the black box of the plane after the incident, police investigators found the reasons that caused this serious incident .
Surveillance technology could be used to detect very risky events and prevent them from happening in the future, hence saving more lives.
In addition, if surveillance technology becomes even better developed, it can be used to detect  problems before real accidents occurs .
However, the dark side of using surveillance technology is that it results in invasion of privacy.
People under supervision are under high pressure to perform naturally.
People are less likely to enjoy life under surveillance.
Therefore, surveillance technology provides convenience to society but causes more inconvenience to individuals.
Therefore, surveillance technology can be used but the use of surveillance should be modified in such a way that individuals are less affected in normal life.
In general, surveillance technology benefits society and should be used  individuals' lives .
I do not agree with this statement that surveillance technology should not be used to track people.
Technology is always improving to catch up with the fast pace of this world and most surveillance technology is used by the police or military to track people down.
Although surveillance technology is an issue in safeguarding human privacy, it has also brought us lots of benefits and security.
There are two points supporting this argument.
Firstly, security systems have improved in many areas such as on the school campus or at the workplace.
Secondly, it makes it possible for parents to track their children and also their elderly parents.
Therefore, this technology should be used to track people.
Much of this surveillance is being implemented in government sectors, or military areas to enhance their security.
It can also be found in schools and workplaces.
It is useful to the government and people in the law sector.
They can maintain social control and recognize threats.
Video surveillance gives people a sense of security should anything happen.
In addition, it can provide all day surveillance around the school or office with little manpower needed.
For example, intruders could be detected if there are any in schools or offices.
This can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation, particularly  small children who are studying in nursery.
In addition, it can also prevent theft.
This technology can also be a helpful tool to assist law enforcers, such as the police, to collect evidence of crimes after they occur .
This can increase the efficiency of solving  crimes and thus decreasing the number of criminal acts or people.
With the help of video surveillance, the number of people committing crimes can decrease .
Although, video surveillance may be a help to most sectors, it can also be misused by many people.
