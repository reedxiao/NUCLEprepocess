Not long from now SARS  , as blurry as it is  , attacked people all around the world  .
Since no one knew about this disease before  , it spread around the whole world before human taking action  .
The spreading speed was so fast that plenty of people died before knowing about it  .
An atmosphere of death covered the whole world  .
The expression of desperation can be seen everywhere  .
The war kills a lot of people  , which is not doubtful  .
After going through the WW1 and WW2  , the population on the earth got much fewer  .
No matter because the technology was not developed enough or because there were wars and battles one after another  , people just didn't live a long life  .
Hence  , as technology especially in the medical field continues to get developed and updated  , people don't risk their lives anymore  .
People are happy to see that they can finally live a long life without sacrificing their blood in battles and with more and more perfect medical insurance  .
The medical equipment and staff are getting more and more today  .
Although some countries in Africa and Southeast Asia still face a lack of medical insurance  , the world in all is getting better in the field  .
With modern machine and growing method  , human don't need to worry about the amount of food anymore  .
All the achievements human make influence the lifespan of people  .
That is why population ageing can be seen as an achievement  .
Population ageing is not all about the good side of the society though  .
As the society develops  , people gradually find that population ageing brings us many problems  .
With more and more people not working at all and receiving the allowance from the government  , the society's balance is broken  .
It is difficult to keep economy functioning well  .
Times change  , people change  .
Many young people don't view things like their parents used to do  .
Many young people choose not to have kids or have fewer kids than before  .
This problem is very common in developed countries  .
With more perfect system with the old and more modern equipment  , population ageing always comes first  .
The governments are seeking solutions to solve this problem  .
For example  , they encourage people to have more children by awarding them  .
They pull up the age to retire  .
No matter what measures they take  , the population ageing still remains a serious problem and that is where the challenge lies  .
RFID is used in many forms for example  , transportation  , homes and even offices  .
Over these years  , it had help humans to improve the accessibility in the forms of cards to gain access to certain places  .
Other than using it on these areas  , it is also been used as human implant or as a form of products  .
These implants and products are also been used as surveillance tools  .
For using as a surveillance tool  , it could also be used in terms of surveys and statistics  .
There are also medical tools that are more of implant into the human body for the basic medical research  .
Moreover  , the use of RFID chip in tracking clothes were also very common sight in the service industry for the huge number of clothing to be identified and tracked the location of it at any one point  .
When RFID had been used in the transportation needs in the form of ez-link cards  , the ability to gain faster and easier access of the transportation needs had been seen over the years  .
This from also can be used as a tracking device where the places a person visited for the past few trips were all recorded by the system and the cards  .
This form of tracking is not harmful and disturbing to the society as it could be used to fight crimes to maintain law and order  .
As this information is been well keep by the operators where they encrypt the data and used it in the proper form  .
This also prevents the chances of normal hackers to get this information that were recorded for proper usages are misused for unlawful usages  .
Moreover  , the use of the RFID for medical research is also been widely used in many countries  .
These chips were also implanted under the human skin where it also helps to store the basic information of the person in it  .
This form of tools does not harm but it helps in the ability to identify any person who is not carrying any identification when comes to emergency  .
This important information may be needed to save the person life where their medical history was all recorded in the chip  .
Additionally  , the service industry were also using it to track its clothes that were been used by their employees  .
This is a scene seen in Resort World Sentosa  .
The clothes were all implanted with an RFID tracking chip for easy identification and recording of the whereabouts the clothes is at  .
As their clothes were mass collected and washed by an external company  , the ability to have a tracking system to know the whereabouts of their clothing helps in terms of the logistical hassle  .
Therefore  , the usages of RFID chips were more useful to help the human in the basic needs or task that is required  .
This form of tracking were also not harmful to any person where they much of these information were all used for helping a person then disrupt the lives of human race  .
Therefore I agree that the use of the RFID technology in tracking any person or product that would help the human race which also been mention above  .
I think that surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) can be used to track people  .
Nowadays  , with the rapid development of science and technology  , the emerging technologies always contribute to human beings better living conditions  .
For example  , the Internet has abridged the distance among people globally  .
Although we have to admit some bad effect which is brought up by the new technology  , still the advantages of the new technologies cannot be simply discarded  .
Back to the surveillance technology  , people may say it leaks their privacy or personal life  .
Compared to this disadvantage  , we should think about what the advantages it has make available for human beings  .
It can provide a safe  , convenient  , identifiable environment  .
Tracking people using surveillance technology can make better security of people's life  .
For the old people  , if they are alone at home  , one day  , they want to go out for a walk  .
In case  , they have some accident like heart attack  , the track of them will show there is something wrong  .
The people can get there as soon as possible to save them  .
For the young people  , parents do not need to worry about where my kids will go after the school  .
By investigating the track by the surveillance technology  , they can easily figure out where are their kids now and know roughly what they are doing  .
On the other hand  , due to the track of people  , the police can better know a person's daily schedule  .
It gives the police a better control of the criminal  .
All these contributions by using the surveillance technology to track make the environment safer  .
Tracking people using surveillance technology can make people's life more convenient and identifiable  .
Nowadays  , people need to carry a lot of ID cards around to show that I am the one the same as the one on the ID cards  .
If we have these technologies  , it will automatically confirm people's indemnification and save the effort to carry a lot of cards  .
Once people have their own identity confirmed  , they can even need not to bring any money along with them  .
To purchase goods  , they just need to deduce money from their identity and make a transition of money to the one who is selling the goods  .
Based on the identifiable environment  , a lot of convention way or style of human life can be changed  .
For the privacy concern  , if the technology can be made to adjust to human being's feeling  , it will be more welcomed  .
For example  , if the one who carry the identifiable sensor does not want any other to know his or her location  , he or she can disable the track  .
Then  , you may ask  , how can the police get the information  ?
I think that the track can be saved in some place which is not open to public  .
Once it is very severe  , the records will be pop out for official use  .
As you can see  , there are quite a lot of advantages of using the surveillance technology to track people  .
In short  , it can provide a safe  , convenient  , identifiable environment for human beings  .
Besides  , we can try to reduce the bad effect cause by the new technology  .
Thus  , I strongly agree that surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) can be used to track people  .
I do not agree with the above statement  .
In my opinion  , surveillance technology such as RFID should be used to track people though there do exist many problems if it prevails  .
This can help to regulate people's behavior  , control crime and prevent terrorism  , and set up demographic data  .
RFID  , despite the fact that it may be considered as privacy infringement  , is different from video surveillance  .
Unlike video surveillance  , RIFD can only reflect the location and movements of the person with tags  .
Without sending back any images or sound record  , RFID is more user-friendly and helps prevent user's privacy at the best it can  .
Firstly  , RFID is a useful tool to help to regulate human or animal behavior  .
The tags can be used on those who need to be took care or the beloved ones  , such as a child whose parents are always concerning about his whereabouts when parents are not together with him  , or maybe a lovely dog whose owner fears to lost her  .
In the first case  , RFID can be used to help parents to surveillance their children so that they can make sure if they are at school or playing around at his friends' home  , and this may help parents regulate their children's behavior  .
Secondly  , RFID can be used to control crime and prevent terrorism  .
Everyday crimes are happening from time to time  , and help to keep low criminal rate can be a combo of ethical  , physiological and social problems  .
RFID can be one of the trivial ways to help dispel criminal or terroristic thoughts  .
Police can put tags on those that have potential intention to commit crime  .
Thus  , when a man with a 'terrorism tag' entering a junction or a plaza full of people police should notice this and observe the man's behavior as well as checking his package to prevent him from explode TNT  .
Apart from preventing crime and terrorism  , RFID can also be used as an evidence or alibi to help infer whether the suspect is the criminal or not  .
What is more  , RFID can be used to help collect demographic data  .
If RFID is used on everyone and running for years  , surveillance centre will have a complete set of statistic data showing the movement of people from city to city  , from town to town  , which city is expanding more than people thought  , which city is becoming less attractive  .
Statisticians can use these data to build up appropriate models to predict the future needs for each city so that local governments know where and when to build more infrastructures  , what kind of infrastructures and what other development should be made  .
Economics can take advantage of these figures to predict the economic trend of local as well as the whole country  .
As for transportation  , roads and traffic authority can easily identify where traffic jams are and advise drivers to change to suggested routes  .
In all  , RFID should be applied to facilitate governors to better manage the world that we are living  .
It can help regulate behaviors  , prevent crime and set up demographic data base for various uses  .
But before the application  , governments need to secure safety of RFID after implantation and make sure there will not be any ID theft  .
More importantly  , governments should make sure only the right people can get access to these data and they must guarantee that they will not misuse or abuse the information  .
As technology becomes more advanced nowadays  , people are very exposed to the various types of technology in their daily lives  .
It is undeniable that technology has made ours lives and works easier and more efficient  .
However  , when surveillance technology starts to violet the privacy of people instead of being used in a more benefitial way towards people  , it is my opinion  , that  , such technology should rethink its way of existence  .
In fact  , people are getting more exposed in public through the fast development of the virtual world-the internet  .
Social networks such as facebook   ,Tiwtter and many others often reveal the true identities and some confidential information of the users without being realised  .
This already raises up a problem of privacy leakage  .
The surveillance technology deteriorates the problem by stalking on people's privacy openly which may arouse anger and unhappiness among people  .
Such incident happened in London a few years ago  , when the government installed CCTV() on several streets in order to better supervise its people to keep the social order  .
This was supposed to be applauded by the public because it allowed fast searching on people who violated the law and caused harm to others  .
Instead  , when news of the installment of such device was released on the newspaper  , it was heavily cricised by the public  .
People were claiming the lost of privacy  .
Government had to uninstall all the devices in the end  .
From this case  , we can clearly conclude that surveillance technology may be helpful in some way  , however  , when it touches the privacy of people themselves  , it is unacceptable  .
From the point of humanity  , it is inhumane to use such technology on human beings  .
We often put tags on products and animals because we treat them as goods  , it is easy for trade when they are all labelled and tagged  .
However  , human beings are not animals or any other products  , they have their own thoughts and freedom  .
They have a full control of their own lives  .
If so  , then why do we need human implants to trace their activities and lives when they are free to do things that they like  .
It is understandable that once people have human implants  , they may start to behave themselves because they can be easily traced out  .
However  , this way of curbing the crimes is so violent that will only cause people to rebel and think of ways to escape the track of such device  .
Afterall there will be an endless battle between the technology and human mentality  .
Humanity can be best seen in the case of pets rearing  .
Pets are supposed to be chained when they are out on the streets  .
However  , in countries like China  , where there is no law to force people to chain their pets  , pets are usually left unchained and run freely on the streets  .
It may be dangerous as some pets are rather fierce and aggressive  , however  , it is the benevolence nature of human beings that we treat pets as "human beings"  , our friends that we do not want to restrict their freedom  .
This phenomenon is accepted by the public even by those who do not own a pet  .
This shows that even though there is a risk of causing harms to someone  , people still prefers to bear the risk and allow their pets to have maximum freedom  .
Even pets are granted with freedom  , people themselves certainly treat freedom as something essential  .
In conclusion  , I think that surveilence technology should not be allowed to be used to track people  .
it does not only restrict their freedom in all aspects   , but also cause leakage of personal information  .
This greatly violets the rights of people  .
