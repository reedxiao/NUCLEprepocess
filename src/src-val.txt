Population ageing is a global phenomenon that arises in both developed and developing countries.
Average life span rise from 45 years old in 1920s to over 65 years old in 2010s.
In the social science report last year, this number will further increase to 90 years old in 2080s due to the advance medical technology and better living standard.
Population ageing means that there are more retired old people in the society and the portion of working adults is decreased.
It may cost higher social cost burden which further leads to the allocation of funds in government yearly budget.
Medical expenses, EPF and accommodation are the costs which directly involved to the old people.
It is responsibility of government to ensure the living of old people.
Otherwise, there are more and more people staying at the street and destroy the good view of Garden City.
In addition, it is also a challenge for government, family and parents to educate their children about the moral of filial.
With the moral of filial, most of the children will take care of their parents after their retirement life.
It is to prevent from sending them to old folk's house and do not visit them at all.
We also do not want to see the happening of worst things that parents are dropped by children along the streets and let them die themselves.
It may be a challenge but also golden opportunity to educate their children properly to prevent the undesired outcomes.
Life expectancies rise significantly from the past to recent in the whole world.
It is the outcomes of advance medical technology, changing of lifestyle and higher living standard.
However, among the under-developed countries, developing countries and developed countries, we found that there is longest life span in the developed countries follows by the developing countries and the shortest life span in under-developed countries.
The observation means that the more developed the countries, the longer the life span of citizens.
In the other words, it also can be said that it is an achievement to obtain an ageing population.
It is proud to have the ageing population which is hard to achieve unless there are advance medical technology and higher living standard.
Besides that, ageing population has an important and essential thing that we cannot buy in cash.
There is the experience in life time.
During the work, supervisor usually asks the so called "old staff' to lead the newbie.
It shows that significant case of the important of experience.
With the existing of experience, we can do the work more quickly without sacrifice the standard and quality.
It may leads a shorter ways to the decision and provide more sales and revenue for company.
The economy of country is boosted up and further leads to the new development and rise up our living standard.
In conclusion, there are challenges as well as achievement in the rising life expectancies which we cannot exclude.
Therefore, we must encounter the challenges and be proud of the achievement to create a new life for our next generation.
In 1712, Watt renovated the steam machine which increases the efficiency of the fuel.
This activity can be marked as the start of the first technology revolution.
As the technology develops faster and faster during 301 years, people not only enjoy more and more materials but also more and more health care which provides convenience in our daily life.
This significantly raised people's average life expectancy.
However, as the life expectancy of people rises, population ageing problem becomes more and more severe as a global phenomenon.
Studies have shown that the current average life span is over 65.
Projections of the United Nations indicate that the population aged 60 or over in developed and developing countries is increasing at 2% to 3% annually.
As the rise of life expectancies can be interpreted as a measure standard of the pace of technology development, it can be seen an achievement of human being.
However, as the energy and resources use up, more and more adult people without sufficient power to produce crowd on earth will aggravate the ageing problem, so the rise of life expectancies can also be seen as a challenge.
As we are human who are different from other animals, we have some basic rights like right to privacy, right to live, right to have a family and so on.
Among these basic rights, the most important one is the right to live.
During the less developed times, due to disasters like droughts,floods or severe contagious disease like black deaths, people at that time could lose their property and lives easily since they do not have enough power to protect themselves and restore their life in a short time.
However, as the technology develops, it increased people's mobility and productivity so as life expectancies.
As we can use the resources with maximum efficiency, we can enjoy more and more life material than any time of human society.
Even when the disaster comes, we can restore the order of our life in a relatively short time than before.
For example, the tsunami in Tohoku of Japan in 2011 is "the toughest and the most difficult crisis for Japan in the 65 years after the end of World War II" as CNN commented.
(CNN, 2011) However, only one year has passed, most of the survivors have come back to their normal life although with a sad memory.
This is not imaginable during less developed times.
With the strong back support of technology, the rises of life expectancies can be seen as an achievement to the development of our human society.
However, along with the increase of life expectancies, ageing problems becomes more and more severe.
Two of the most important causes of ageing problem is the increasing longevity and declining fertility.
The increasing longevity is due to fast development of the society so as the living pressure.
The increasing pressure will lead to the declining fertility.
As people who are incapable of production become more and more, our society follows a downward trend.
Moreover, as we use up more and more resources, what we have left may not enough for us to live on if we do not have enough human resource to do research of developing new technology.
Therefore, the increase of life expectancies is also a great challenge.
As we have mentioned above, the increase of life expectancy is an achievement as well as a challenge.
Surveillance technology is getting more and more widely used with the development of modern technology in terms of various scientific breakthroughs.
And after all this scientific research result is applied to daily life, products such as RFID tracking system have become real.
RFID is not only used to track products for logistical and storage purpose, it is also used to track people by doing human implants.
It is unacceptable for some people in the society, however, I think this application is necessary and provides the society a lot of benefit.
Surveillance technology such as RFID has been used to track people may help to reduce the number of people who get lost.
For example, there are always news on newspaper, report that some elderly get lost at certain place and their family are looking for him or her.
The family members must be worrying a lot about the lost elderly, and with the help of police office, maybe they can find the elderly back, but it will take a long time, and a lot of energy to find someone in a country has a population about five million without knowing the exact location of that person.
However, if the elderly has been implanted with RFID devices, then it will be much easier for the family to find him or her with the special serial number issued to each device differently.
They can track the location of the device with the information provided by the RFID signals; therefore find the location of the lost elderly in a shorter period of time.
Surveillance technology such as RFID is not only useful to track the lost people but also useful to prevent the trading of children which happens in many developing countries.
It may be known that young children may be stolen by some agency that doing the business to trade the children.
For example, they may wait in the public area and wait for parents to bring their children out but didn't pay attention to the child, so that this kind of agency may bring the child to mountain area and sell him or her with a good price.
Since this is happen more often in the country which is much larger than Singapore, it is even harder or maybe it is impossible for the parents to find the child back without knowing where the child has been brought to.
Since this may happen across province, and without any clue about the path that the child may went through.
However, if the child has been installed with tracking device, more information will be provided along the way when the family is trying to find him or her back.
Not only the details of location will be provided, but also may lead to find out the root of this kind of children trading agency and it helps to prevent more this kind of tragedy to happen on any family.
Surveillance technology will help to prevent the family to loss their member especially the elderly and the children which need to be pay more attention to.
In modern world, many global issues have been appeared like global warming, concept of earth village and population.
Nowadays, population aging is becoming a problem especially in the developed countries.
Now in Singapore, we can feel that there are more old people than young people if you go to Chinatown.
Population ageing also has brought us a question on whether we should raise life expectancies, it is challenging also can get some achievement.
In the first place, rising life expectancies could cause resources challenge.
In some very small and developed regions and countries like Singapore and Hong Kong, if people still increase the humans' life, but for these small developed regions, the resources are very limited especially land.
Because the land is limited, so the average land for one person is very small already.
Some years, there is a report on Hong Kong citizens living situation, in a small room there are eight people, they cannot do anything in the room, only can sleep and the air in the room is very bad.
So rising life expectancies will make the world population larger, more people shall the limited resources.
In economic, we can use GDP to explain the challenge, if GDP is low, it shows that most of people are living in a hard life, life quality is bad, then it will cause the terrible society problem, at last, it will happen the society disturbance.
The reason why it will happen is because people have violated the natural regulation.
On the other hand, rising life expectancies could bring some achievements.
People's life quality has been better now, in order to continue improving, people have begun to consider how to raise their life.
Because the life and health are most significant, people have their own reasons to hope living longer.
On medicine, people have done a lot of researches on life science.
Also people begin to realize the importance of the environment, how to protect people from the harmful air.
So according to the humanism, people should make contribution to rising the humans life, because people should consider the feelings if one day when you are becoming older and older, so respecting life should be considered carefully.
In addition, now there appears a contradiction if rising life expectancies, it will lead a resources problem.
However, based on the humanism, humans are different from the animals, people should respect every life.
In my opinion, I think we should study balance it well, one side we should continue to make efforts to raise the humans life, one side, we should consider using asking some sick old men whether if they want to take euthanasia.
To summary, we respect every life, also help people to live longer.
In conclusion, what I have mentioned above, although global aging issue has become more serious on humans development, if we can balance and understand why we live.
Then try to invent new energy and legitimately control population birth rate, then developing the medical treatment and paying enough attention, we have reasons to trust, population aging will not be problem at all.
Nowadays, population aging has become a more global phenomenon.
Subsequently, a lot of problems regarding to it are arising.
Due the rise of the life span and the shrink of the birth rate, the portion of the elderly portion is larger and larger.
As our society develops, the people have a much higher living standard, which will reduce the chance of getting disease.
Besides, as the development of the technology, the medical therapy also has a tremendous progress.
Many diseases which are incurable in the past can be cured now.
Therefore, the patient will have a bigger chance to be cured and survive.
Both of the two reasons will decrease the number of died people annually.
On the other hand, the birth rate in many countries keeps decreasing, whose figure is the lowest record comparing to previous figure.
Maybe, it is because the modern society is become more and more competitive, the parents are paying much attention and importance to their career.
They do not want to bother to spend so much time in raising and nurturing children.
Maybe that's one reason for the reducing of the birth rate.
The fact is that the current average life span is over 65 and the population aged 60 or over in developed and developing countries is increasing at 2% to 3% annually.
This survey evidently shows that big achievement has been made in the medical area and people's living standard has been improved.
It also indicates that the economy has been dramatically grown.
Yet, do not be confused by this superficial amount and achievement.
The issue facing us is more challenging and tricky.
First, if the older people increase, there will be fewer workforces that can support the society.
However, ageing population will also increase many kinds of other expenditure.
The most important part is health care and old-age pension.
As elderly people, they need more money for health care than the younger.
Government should also make a bigger amount of pension expenditure.
Secondly, for the older people, more facilities and service for them should be provided.
So more manpower will be employed, which deduces the labour in other area.
Of course, more money will be spent.
To pay this extra money, government will exert higher taxed on the other people.
Thirdly, compared to the young people, the security of the elderly is more notable.
Elderly people's ability to move and act is much lower.
They will be more vulnerable to be hurt or get some injures.
Therefore, some measurement and education about this should be taken by the government and the surrounding people to ensure the security of the old people.
To conclude, the population ageing phenomenon indeed shows our big achievement on economy, medical skills and living standard.
Nonetheless, the issues it brings out are more worthy to be considered.
More elderly people will bring a big extra burden to the society and government.
More facilities and service will be needed to fulfill these requirements.
Definitely, we should perform these demanded duties very responsibly and carefully.
Whereas, for the sustainable development of the country and the earth, some measurements and policies should be carried out to control and change this phenomenon.
Rising life expectancies is an achievement because it is an evidence of progress of modern medical technology and meanwhile it is a challenge because it can incur the problem of lacking work force or too large population.
It is natural that rising life expectancies is regarded as an achievement.
The goal of every species of living things is reproducing to increase the quantity of this species.
Humankind is not an exception.
People with rising life expectancies can ensure large population and large species of human being.
It is more secure for us because in potential sense we think with longer life expectancy it is harder for people to die out.
Rising life expectancies is also an evidence of progress of modern medical technology.
For ancient people it is miraculous to achieve 70 years old, but now it is general.
Rising life expectancies can bring us more skilled work force because we can delay the retirement time to extend working time for each person.
Longer working period means the old person who is more skilled does not need to retire and no fresh men will take over.
Thus it is more efficient to keep more skilled people for long time rather than training fresh men.
Rising life expectancies can be a challenge.
There are two possibilities.
On one hand, if there are less young people and more old people, lacking work force problem will arise.
On the other hand, if there are enough young people, then young people with rising life expectancies will cause larger population.
We talk about the first possibility.
If there are less young people and more old people, as in both Singapore and China, when elderly retire, there are not enough young people who can make up for the new available positions.
Thus there will be a lacking in labor force, which will lead a decreasing speed of development of the country.
Many factories will be deserted and many companies will go bankruptcy, and thus people's life condition will definitely get worse.
The past 30-year rapid development of China is connected with the large population, but due to the "only child" policy, we have no benefits from large population in the future.
With low birth rate, Singapore is bringing in foreigners to maintain the population to maintain the efficiency and development of the country.
If there are more young people, then there will be even more elderly with rising life expectancies in the future definitely.
Population is large while the resources are limited, which will incur many problems such as environmental problems and inequality among people.
Expansion of population cannot continue like that because the resources are limited, and we will end with dying out after using up all resources.
To sum up, with rising life expectancies, there exist both achievement and challenge.
It is a progress of human being that we control the world and maintain our population with longer life expectancies, but it also has potential crisis for either nation or the human being.
We can either step back to maintain the population with some method, or step forward to search for more resources in outer space.
Population ageing is a phenomenon observed exclusively in advanced civilizations.It requires at least three conditions to happen: advanced health care system, reduced hazards from the environment and the ubiquitous good will for senior citizens.
However, when it happens, it is hard to deny that it brings problems such as increased expenses and reduced labors to the society.
If a country can bear a ageing population, it is a thing that the country can be proud of.
In the first place, it must have grasped advanced health care system.
Ageing problem is in essence a problem of worsening bodies.
With increasing age, people become more prone to disease and injury, and more difficult to recover.
Without advanced health care system, aged people have higher rate of death.
In fact, this was the major limitation of people's average life span in the past.
With advanced medical technology, not only many diseases can be cured, but also people know how to keep themselves healthy.
If developed health care system is increasing the positive side, it would be also helpful to reduce the negative side, which including reducing the hazards from the environment.
Health caring by far has been expensive to carry out.
If the environment is too dangerous to live in, there would be not sufficient medical resources for usage.
Such environmental hazards come from various aspects.
A major source of the hazards is the pollution.
A place with heavily polluted air and water is by no means a good habbitat and will bring a lot of health problems for its residents, among which aged people and children will be harmed most.
Only if the city is safe and comfortable can people live a longer and happier life.
If the above two aspects are described as the hardwares of the system, they do require a software to function, which is the ubiquitous good will for senior citizens.
When people become old, most of them join the weak group of citizens who have to live by receiving care from other people.
If a society has the most advanced medical science and the best environment, but do not grant the access to them to its senior citizens, it just does not help.
And if people in society do not want to care for their elderly, nothing will be done for them.
Only when there is a ubiquitous good will for senior citizens can the aged people live well, and that is a thing to be proud of.
With the glory, there comes problems.
To take care of old people, facillities such as nursing homes should be built, which add on to the expense of society.
An even larger share of the old people expense lies in the health care.
In addition, old people are weakened in many aspects, thus they are usually not considered as labors.
When the percentage of old people grows larger in the population, the labor is considered to become less and each labor need to pay more on the welfare of the old people.
In summary, the rising average life span is both a challenge and an achievement because it means the increase of the load and the advance of society, including at least advaced advanced health care system, reduced hazards from the environment and the ubiquitous good will for senior citizens, at the same time.
"The weak is meat and the strong eat it" does not apply nowadays.
The advance technology saves lots of lives which should never come to this world or should pass away.
For people, this is an achievement, but for nature, it changes its rule and cycle, which is a big challenge faced by human being.
If anyone has ever read any fiction or storied written before the 18th century, it is very hard to find any character in those stories lived longer than 80 years old.
They may die for hunger, die from illness or just went to bed as usual but never waked again.
In China, there is a famous saying that there are things should be celebrated, one is red and one is white.
Here, red thing means marriage and white means someone passing away.
The first time when I read this saying I am confused why someone passing away is a good thing that people should celebrate and later I was told that in past, it is hard to live longer than 60 years old and even though you are very lucky to live longer than 60 years old, you will suffer a lot from illness or the sadness for your young relatives passing away, so people think it is worth celebrating since they will not suffer any longer.
It is very hard to understand such a feeling as people felt in the past.
Now, technology and science develops at an unbelievably fast pace.
There is lots of illness that is thought incurable in the past vanished in the world.
Even though people with cancer, which is still hard to cure, now have more chance to survive and have a longer time to live.
Besides illness, the improvement of technology generates more food both in quantity and in quality.
In the same time, it also frees a great amount of labor.
Now people not only can have food to survive but also enjoy high-level food and even pursuing the tasty and luxury one.
It is a break-through of technology and science, and an outstanding achievement of human wisdom.
Making use of our smart brain to improve our quality of life and give us more time to enjoy the life, it sounds like perfect, but we must face to the reality -- there is no Utopia.
Before people find another planet to live, the earth is the only habitat for us, and hence the limit of its capacity to support livings, it is the limit of the quantity of people that can live.
People's lifetime rising means that the time of the cycle of generation rises.
Furthermore, thanks to the development of technology, that the birth rate is increasing while the death rate is decreasing accelerates population aging and increasing.
To our disappointment, now the technology is not so advanced that it can generate all human beings by using limited resources.
Moreover, the global population aging means that the total amount and quality of labor is decreasing.
Before robots can fully replace labor, the decreasing of generating power indicate less creativity and less goods available for us to use.
It is such a challenge that human being cannot avoid and must solve.
The only way is to develop technology but the chance to develop is based on people's wisdom and creativity, which is decreasing due to population aging.
The world is always fair to us.
While we are celebrating for the break-through of our way to Utopia, we are suffering facing to a new challenge.
We cannot give up what we achieved in the past and follow the natural way die and reborn.
Therefore, the only way available for us to destroy such a balance is accelerating the progress of development so to increase the capacity of our planet.
As with the world is becoming more and more advanced, people are leading a more and more comfortable life.
Moreover, the life expectancies have also been raised due to the developing of the economy.
However, while we are enjoying the fruits carried be the development of the economy, we are also facing a global problem --- population ageing.
There is no doubt that this problem has become more and more serious which have gradually influenced the tendency of the population as well as the source allocation.
Therefore, the rising life expectancies can be considered both a challenge and an achievement.
On one side, we cannot deny that it is a great achievement with the rising life expectancies.
The reason why the life expectancies have aroused is that we are becoming more and more clever due to the evolution, and we are becoming richer and richer due to the knowledge we have learned.
Since that we get richer, we have more money to use to live a more comfortable life.
Therefore, because of the great efforts we have made, we have been living a better life.
And that is what we are striving for.
So the rising life expectancies can be regarded as a proof of what we have made to combat for ourselves.
On the other side, we have to say that obvious problems that we are facing are also caused by the rise of life expectancy.
Since that we have a better living circumstances and higher living quality, we are leading a longer life.
This seems to be a gratifying progress at the first sight.
However, during the process of making development to our life, we decide to reduce the rapid growth of population by adopting the measure of controlling birth so that the shortage of source allocation can also be slowed down.
This also works and we have also seen the effect.
Then there comes a problem.
Because that the birth rate is reduced while the death rate is also reduced, the percentage of the elderly is increased while that of the youth is decreased.
So the population is getting more and more aged.
But the primary labor force as well as the work force is from the youth.
That is to say, the population aging has aggravated the burden of the society.
Then we can see that the rising life expectancies can also be viewed as a challenge for us to face.
Taken together, we should say that the rise of life expectancies is two sided.
It has shown that we are leading a better life but we are forced to face the problem of solving population aging.
However, the achievement that we have made is far more than the problems caused by the challenges.
The significance of our existence is to leading a meaningful life and combat for the development of our world.
There is no absolute perfect way, so we have done a good job on the road.
Therefore, we need to continue on our striving as try our best to reduce the adverse impact that is carried.
Rising life expectancies is an achievement because it clearly demonstrates that overall quality of life is increasing in both developed and developing countries.
However, it is also a challenge because it strains both society and the environment.
It is well-known statistics that, generally, as a country develops the life expectancies increases.
This is the result of better quality of life; which is basically sufficient food and clean water, better sanitations and advanced health-care.
With sufficient food, children will develop properly into adults.
Better sanitations will result in fewer deaths by infection and significantly reduce the spread of diseases and viruses.
Advance healthcare is also a major factor in prolonging the individual's existence on earth.
Examples of how advance health in the city has raised life expectancies are such as antibiotics, the cure of poliomyelitis, and better and cleaner surgical procedures.
All of these are human achievements in their own rights that have resulted in rising life expectancies, and hence they also illustrates why rising expectancies can be considered an achievement.
It is remarkable that population aged 60 and over is increasing at 2% to 3% annually in developing countries as well.
It is highly plausible that the results for increase are the same as the developed countries.
If that is true, it means that human rights and living standards are increasing in developing countries, albeit slowly.
Fewer famines, better sanitations and more access to healthcare in developing countries will be this century's greatest achievement as a global society.
However, an aging population is taxing on a country.
Although life expectancies may increase significantly, the population overall productivity may not increase linearly.
They will end up putting a burden on the society that they have been contributing their whole working career.
With falling birth rates, there will be fewer working adults in society to distribute the workload.
In addition, an aging population will require more healthcare and treatment because one's constitution weakens as one ages.
The challenge is how many lives can the society and community afford to sustain; and it will only become increasingly difficult to handle.
Rising expectancies is also an environmental challenge because a better quality of life requires a lot of energy.
More food, clean water, better sanitation, and healthcare consume large quantities of energy.
An example is the modern method of intense farming.
Large quantities of energy are needed for the pesticides, and to harvest and transport the food produces around the globe.
If the current quality of life has to be sustained or increase in order to keep increasing the life expectancies, it will be continue to have a huge impact on the environment.
The challenge will be increase the quality of life while being environmentally sustainable.
The rising life expectancies can be considered an achievement and a challenge because it is the by-product of rising quality of life; bringing along its glory and its dirty little secrets.
At the present time, people are more concerned about their health.
There are better health care systems to let people check their physical condition regularly, and more and more people choose organic food and eat balanced diet to make them healthier.
As a result, the current average life span is over 65 worldwide now.
By projections of the United Nations, it is shown that population aged more than 60 is increasing at 2% to 3% in the developed and developing countries respectively.
The rising life expectancy is a big achievement of human beings.
However, as there are only limited space and resource on earth, rising life expectancy is also a challenge for all the people worldwide.
Rising life expectancy is a technology achievement.
Back to the ancient days, when human beings firstly appeared on the earth, the average life expectancy is only less than 20.
The reasons are mainly due to the threat of fierce animals like tigers and lions, the lack of food, the lack of hygiene knowledge, and also very importantly, the lack of medicine.
With the development of society, of the past thousands of years, the technology is progressing and the concern for health is arising, so that higher life expectancies are achieved.
With more advanced technology in medicine area, more and more diseases can be cured so that much more death is avoided.
Since people get higher education today, increasing amounts of people switch from fast food to organic food and have a balanced diet so that their chance of getting cancer is lowered.
Such situation is a major progress from the ancient time and also a big achievement by all human beings.
However, since the space and resource on earth is very limited, higher life expectancy means more people will live on the earth at the same time and more fierce competition for food and space is unavoidable.
Since there are more people on the earth, more space is needed for people to live in, so that some farming land might be turned into buildings to accommodate more people.
However, the need for food is also increasing, so that the competition might become even more frightening.
What's worse, since people are unsatisfied with the amount of space and food they have, violence might take place more frequently.
Many violence happened in Middle East is just due to the fight for food and water resource.
With more people living on the earth, pollution might become even serious, and as a result of pollution, the supply of food and water will decrease, so that a negative loop will occur and the problem becomes even harder to solve.
In a word, the rising in life expectancy is both an achievement and a challenge for the whole human beings.
The advanced technology has helped us to live longer, but the limited resource on earth is also a big challenge.
We should do our best to cooperate with each other and live on the same earth in harmony.
With the development of the modern society, people lives longer.
Statistics shows that worldwide, the average life expectancy at birth was 66.57 years for 2009 according to CIA World Factbook 2009.
In the developed countries like Japan and Switzerland, the life expectancy can be as high as more than 80.
Normally, people will regard the extended life expectation as an achievement, and usually use such data as a measure of the development of the countries.
However, as the population is ageing, the challenges such as increased medical cost and shortage of workforce are also realized.
In a nut shell, rising life expectancies can be considered both an achievement and a challenge.
Indeed, thanks to improved living standard and medical care, countless people's lives are extended.
No doubt life is the most precious treasure of human beings.
Without life, we have nothing.
In the long history of the evolution, we are always struggling for life against staving and illness.
In last two centuries, we human have made the greatest achievement in developing our society.
We are modernized and we have gained improved living standard and medical care.
We are no longer bothered by starving and common illness.
In the ancient times, the residents may only live for 30 years; but now, the life expectancy can be 80s in many countries.
With a doubled life time, humans can have change to explore the real meaning of life.
There is a Chinese saying that there is nothing more valuable than to save a man's life.
Hence, the rising life expectancies no doubt can be considered as a great achievement.
On the other hand, the aging of Population can also be a challenge to the society.
When people grow old, they will be weak and get sick easily.
That is the natural law which nobody can violate.
Hence, when the ratio of the seniors whose age is above 60 reaches some certain point, the challenge to the society cannot be neglect anymore.
First, the medical cost will rise greatly.
If the individual or family is to pay the bill, they can be bankrupted because of illness.
If the medical cost is covered by the government budget, the deficit will be a heavy burden affecting the normal operation of the government.
Second, the shortage of workforce can also endanger the development of the society.
Japan society is now facing severe ageing problem, and the path of development is seriously slowed.
There has been a report estimated that at the year 2060, only half of the population in Japan are suitable to work.
The same situation is happening around the world.
Obviously, rising life expectancies should also be considered as a serious challenge.
To conclude, the rising life expectancies must be considered both an achievement and a challenge.
To extend our life is not only a symbol of our achievement in developing our society, but also a fulfillment of our original dream.
At the same time, we also need to consider the negative effects brought by the ageing population, and then find proper measures to counter the challenges.
As the technology increasingly advances, many of things that are regarded as impossible are turning into the 'possibles'.
From internet, email to the most powerful surveillance technology, every step is advancement to not only the society but also the world's achievements.
People's lives become from increasingly convenient to almost luxury, thanks to the implementation of increasingly technology available for the Man's life.
However, such rapid advancement technology though can be extremely useful to our daily life; it can also cause the invisible or massive threats to our peaceful livings that can be out of our imaginations and estimations.
Today, the surveillance technology has become almost manifest to wherever we go.
Take Singapore for example, these are installed from highly secured places such as Government sectors to working places, from condominiums to housing development board houses, and even from school canteens to toilets!
Even our applications in our Iphones or other smartphones, our I-pad can easily revealed our locations.
Every moves of us are being closely surveilled and followed once we stepped out of homes.
Now, surveillance technology such as RFID is even invented to track people.
I agree to a great extent that RFID technology shall not be easily available for the public and taken for granted.
On the other hand, I will also discuss the RFID shall be utilized for good purposes.
I agree that RFID technology shall not be made available to the public for easy abuse and distorted usage.
First, our privacy is at threat.
Though tracking devices such as the applications in our smartphones these days can add fun and entertainment to our fast-living paced livings, this can be a double-edged sword.
We revealed our locations, for our friends to catch up with us, however we can never know who is watching us out there secretly.
Hackers become increasingly vicious, invading into our computer system, now with radio-frequency tracking device, this may fall into inappropriate hands for the wrong reasons.
Every moves of us are easily tracked.
This is very hazardous.
No matter how good and how many security systems are there for us, the hackers are also increasingly improving their skills in terms of hacking and breaking the codes of the security system.
On the other hand, I think RFID can be useful when comes to appropriate handling and usage.
For example, this can be a very beneficial and useful device for police force to track crime suspects and terrorists for their movements, or contributing to more leads for solving a case.
Additionally, if appropriately used, this device can contributed to our scientific findings and research.
In this, I mean that we can input this device implant into an animal or birds species, for us to track their movements and actions relating to our human research that can bring us to a new regime.
RFID is indeed a great invention.
It can benefit our mankind if appropriately used.
However, I think such powerful device shall not be made easily available for the public or fall into the hands of 'ill-intentioned' individuals.
This will lead to more crimes and bring threats to our privacy.
The population ageing is now a heated expression in individuals' lives.
These two words can be seen from various media and assessments of this social trend are of great number.
When mentioning about the population ageing, media always consider it as a social problem.
It is deniable that population ageing can cause a lot of problems, but in the same time, it is also a symbol of improvement.
Therefore, population ageing should be considered both a challenge and an achievement.
Following are the more specific explanations.
The rising average life expectancies can surely cause some problems.
Firstly, the aging population is generally of low productivity.
It is a natural rule that when people grow older, their bodies will be less flexible and brains will operate slower, so they will contribute less to the society.
In addition, elderly people are using same or even more amount of social resource, as they need more medical support and human help caused by their weaker physical status.
Furthermore, to make livings, many senior citizens go back to work field.
It will also induce many problems.
For example, these senior citizens may do the work less efficient and which will lead to a low effective output.
To make him or her more competitive so that not be beat by the younger, old people usually accept lower compensation or bonus.
This may lead to the younger's lower employment rate and opportunities and thus they have to live with huge pressure and lower living standard to reduce the daily cost.
Besides, the elderly with less salary also have to lower their living standard; both the consequences can cause a decrease in social happiness level and drive the whole society in to a less stable situation.
There are also some older people live a rich life with their deposits and retirement compensation.
They can live a happy life, but actually to the society as a whole, it is a waste of social resource.
Also, the growing percentage of older people will cause the maintenance of many traditional thoughts and mindsets which may become a resistance of the positive social change.
Above all, the population aging will be a great challenge for the world for it drags the development of a society.
However, the growing life expectancies also mean an achievement to the human society.
Actually, living a longer life needs a lot of conditions to realize.
There are many factors which will result in the death of people, such as natural disasters, accident, diseases or suicides.
Long life span for the individual himself is a great achievement which indicates he or she is brave enough to face the life full of problems.
For the whole society, rising life expectancies are a symbol of more advances science and technology especially in the medical field, better social environment and a safer world.
Therefore, human need to appreciate the longer life span and consider it as an achievement.
Every coin has two sides.
The rising life expectancies are like a two side sword to the modern world.
It can cause many problems but it also means a lot for the human beings.
What we can do now is to try hard to solve the problems and in the same time appreciate its great meanings.
Rising Life Expectancies, Not Only an Achievement, But Also a Challenge
According to recent research, population ageing is a global phenomenon and the current average life span is over 65.
The rising of life expectancies is not only an achievement, but also a great challenge.
Obviously, rising of life expectancies is a mark of our achievements in terms of hospitalizing technology, insurance condition, culture development, and our social system, which shows the improvements of people's life quality.
Thanks to the development of technology and society, some deadly diseases in the past are curable now, and people are more aware of how to take care of our body.
This is the great achievement made by the generation.
At the same time, it is also a great challenge.
With the population ageing and the increasing portion of the old people, we are facing lots of problems now.
For individuals, since people's life expectancies are becoming longer, there will be more troubles for them to take care of themselves, especially for those who live alone or have diseases and are poor.
For example, it becomes hard for them to earn their livings; they may feel lonely especially if their spouses died; they may suffer from all kinds of diseases.
And they may not get as much attention from their family as before.
For families, certainly, the burden for young people is becomes heavier.
In China, lots of families only have one child.
That means when the child grows up, they need to take care of both parents.
One family at least should take care of four old people.
For a few groups of families, there are even up to eight old people since their grandparents are also live with them.
Besides financial burdens, they may also need to spend more energy to take care of them.
These may be too much for these young parents as they still need to look after their own children.
For society, when the group of old people becomes larger and less people can work for the society, this society may lack of labours.
And at the same time, these old people take up a larger portion of resource and budges of this society.
To some degree, it will delay the economic development of the world.
Besides, society needs to figure out more policies to secure old people's lives.
Also, the population ageing calls for a higher standard of medical treatment and technology, higher level of civilization of our life.
If our spiritual aspect of civilization cannot match our material aspect, old people will have a tough twilight years.
Now population aging is a trend.
It is an achievement of our society, but it is also a great challenge calling us to face the new situation.
Population ageing seems to be an achievement when it first happened.
In the old times, people could easily lose their life due to hunger, disease, government, war or something else.
After a country was just founded, some immature policy leaded to a nationwide hunger.
Millions of people could not find food to eat and ended up eating all the trees and grass which could be seen.
There was everywhere wandering people trying to find food.
Some people even eat their own dead children.
There was a saying which says that hunger can bring people back to animals.
Infectious disease is also a life killer.
