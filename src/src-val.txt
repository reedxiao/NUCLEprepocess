However, video surveillance may be a help to most sectors, it can also be misused by many people.
Some may use it to peek or record something illegal.
For example, it could be installed in personal lockers to record other's moves and actions.
This technology could also be seen as invasion of human's privacy.
Surveillance technology could cause everyone to feel paranoid and as if our actions are being watched.
This could lead to psychological implications and thus causing many tremendous social effects that may be harmful to our society.
If everyone is being watched unknowingly, it seems that our freedom of doing things is being invaded.
Technology can be a very useful tool if being used in the correct manner.
It may be a help to prevent potential crimes from happening but also help people do crime.
The knowledge of installing surveillance should be taught to everyone so that crimes can be eliminated instead of increasing it.
The more people using it over us, the more power they will have on us.
We should respect that everyone has human rights and without other's permission, this should not be placed or implanted to anyone.
We do not want to be sued infringing other's privacy, therefore, before implanting any RFID, we should ask for other's consent.
Surveillance technology is getting more and more widely used with the development of modern technology in terms of various scientific breakthroughs.
And after all this scientific research result is applied to daily life, products such as RFID tracking system have become real.
RFID is not only used to track products for logistical and storage purpose, it is also used to track people by doing human implants.
It is unacceptable for some people in the society, however, I think this application is necessary and provides the society a lot of benefit.
Surveillance technology such as RFID has been used to track people may help to reduce the number of people who get lost.
For example, there are always news on newspaper, report that some elderly get lost at certain place and their family are looking for him or her.
The family members must be worrying a lot about the lost elderly, and with the help of police office , maybe they can find the elderly back, but it will take a long time, and a lot of energy to find someone in a country has a population about five million without knowing the exact location of that person.
However, if the elderly has been implanted with RFID devices, then it will be much easier for the family to find him or her with the special serial number issued to each device differently.
They can track the location of the device with the information provided by the RFID signals; therefore find the location of the lost elderly in a shorter period of time.
Surveillance technology such as RFID is not only useful to track the lost people but also useful to prevent the trading of children which happens in many developing countries.
