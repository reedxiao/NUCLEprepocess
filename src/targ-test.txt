Surveillance technology such as RFID is not only useful to track lost people but is also useful to prevent the trading of children, which happens in many developing countries.
It may be known that young children may be stolen by some agency that trades their children.
For example, they may wait in a public area and wait for parents who do  not pay attention to the child, so that of this kind of agency may bring the child to a mountain area and sell him or her for a good price.
Since this happens more often in countries which are much larger than Singapore, it is even harder or maybe it is impossible for the parents to find the child without knowing where the child has been brought to.
However, if the child has been implanted with a tracking device, more information will be provided along the way when the family is trying to find him or her back.
Not only the details of location will be provided, but also details that may lead to the children trading agency and help to prevent more this kind of tragedy from happening to any family.
Surveillance technology will help to prevent families from losing their members, especially the elderly and the children who need to be paid more attention to.
